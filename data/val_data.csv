0,"Frumpy if you are petite I loved the criss cross part of this tank. however, it looked so frumpy on. the cut was just odd and if you are petite it felt like a tent. i was so bummed because that criss cross was awesome but it just looked so weird on. i returned it. the material felt nice too."
1,"Soft but a bit maternity The blue is a beautiful color, rather unique and it is really soft being cashmere. although, for the price i do feel it should of been a bit more ""special"". i also feel it's loose lower half feels a bit maternity. all that being said i do like the overall sweater and am keeping it as the color and feel win."
1,Love Beautiful top and beautiful bright color. this does run 2 sizes small in arms and chest unless you are very narrow in stature and flat chested . i am usually a size 6 and a 36c and broad shoulders and size 10 just its in underarm area. i have short torso so love the length but those with very long torso may find this blouse too short. if you get the right size this topics really adorable. my husband also gave it a big thumbs up.
1,Chirpy sleepy These are darling. love flannel and pattern which is very upbeat. wish they were a little more pegged/slim/tapered at the bottoms.
1,"Beautiful camel color Love this top! tried it on in store...so glad i did since it runs large and i had to size down to a medium. the color is a beautiful camel and the material is soft...very grateful the fabric content did not contain dreaded wool, lol! therefore leaving it soft and comfortable to wear...the price tag was a bit much considering it is only a sweater vest but with retailer price equals quality so i don't mind spending the extra $!"
1,"Lounge like royalty! I ordered these in a xxs, a little nervous about them being too small, and i was very pleased with the fit. for reference, i'm 5'2, 98lbs. these are great for all seasons, the lining is warm, yet adds a pop of color when cuffed. the crowns on the birds are pretty nifty!"
0,"If you have any ""bust"" not for you! Loved this shirt when i saw the picture. unfortunately fit was not what it needed to be to keep it. you can't really see in the photo but if you have any chest at all (i am only 34b...so would say of average size bust) this shirt will not fit well. there is a seam in the bust area that cuts across the bust which is not flattering/doesn't fit well . the sleeves were also a bit more tight than i'd have thought from the photo.

really wanted to love this - but unless you have a smaller chest it lik"
1," I love this top! the neckline is so unusual and so flattering. i am normally either a small or xs, but this fit great in the xs. i was also able to wear a regular bra which is always nice since i am large chested. great top...highly recommend."
0,"Cute top but very uncomfortable The styling of this top is so cute but the fabric is thin, kind of scratchy & has
almost no give to it.  it is very uncomfortable on & is very restricting as far as
movement is concerned.   cannot recommend - back it goes!"
1," Bought this tank on a whim, but i'm so happy i did! so flattering, comfy and well made."
0,"Not peachy I fell in love with the shirt when i saw it online; but, i was incredibly disappointed with it when it was delivered.  on the positive side, the macrame is stunning.  once again, there was way too much fabric which makes me look pregnant.  most importantly, the color is not peach!  it's almost a burnt indian red or brick red/orange.  it was a disgusting color."
1,"Can go either petite or not I tried on te regualr size (xs) as that is all they have in my store, and decided to get them anyway, even if a little long on me. why? because htey are so cute rolled up with the yellow color showing!

super comfortable, have not washed htem yet, but hipefully they remain a decent wuality."
1,"Simply love This sweater is substantial, well-made, fabric is thick and comfortable. the length is on the shorter side, not cropped but shorter, perhaps if they had petite, ti would be cropped. the sleeves are perfect length too on me, it looks shorter on the model, they hit at mys wrists (i do usually need petite length). it seems a simple top, but it is quite beautiful in person. i strongly recommend it, even for the price...

xs and i am 115 lbs, 30dd chest, 26.5 in waist"
1,Great top. runs small! Great top but it runs smaller than other tops in this brand. the chest and arm area is small. otherwise this top is great. just plan to size up one or two sizes. length was nice. hit right at the waist.
1,Love this dress! The material feels nice and i love the flared arms.
0,"Too big I love the teal color of this t-shirt and the macrame design at the top is beautiful, however, the top is way too large.  i usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops, so i ordered the size s, there is so much fabric below the chest it fits like a maternity top.  i know if i order an xs, i will have the same problem.  below the bust, the top is not flattering and it&amp;#39;s a shame."
1,"Soft, comfy, perfect fit for xl I've had great luck with items from sunday in brooklyn & this vest is another fantastic purchase. the color/fit match the photos. the material is so soft. i've worn it quite a bit since i received it and it hasn't pilled. it's washed well too. the braided part can be folded down if you don't want it higher on your neck. it will still lay flat & drape nicely. it's perfect for cold weather. i'd love to see this come out in other colors too."
0,"Pretty but weird fit I initially liked the feel and quality of the top but once it was on it was much shorter and looser than the picture of the model. it flowed out from my chest with one central pleat in the front and my husband said it made me look pregnant. then came the tedious task of taking it off with such a snug fit in the shoulders. i'm regularly a size 2/xs, 32d and 120 lbs and both size 2 and 4 did not work for me."
1,"Love this vest This vest is so functional. i think it is much prettier in person than in this photo. it has a much softer look to it and is less orange, more tan. i've worn it with a lot of different things: over a sweater dress at work, with soft pants and a long-sleeve t-shirt, or skinny jeans/pants and a simple top. wish it came in other colors (gray, navy or green would all be amazing)...one of my favorite pieces this season for sure. i do think it runs a little bit large, but i think the next size smaller"
1, I love these overalls  but they run very small?i had to return and reorder.
0,Disappointed I looked at this dress for a long time before i purchased it because of the money. i wear a size 2p. was entirely disappointed in the style and construction of this dress. for one thing the lining is bulky and you could never wear it in warmer weather without burning up. the dress as pictured looks very feminine and light weight silk but there is just too much material going on--- thick and heavy. the overall fit was too big and very unflattering.
1,"Love these chirpy loungers! When i saw these lounge pants, i felt as though they were designed specifically for me. i love the cute bird design. i love the green/blue color of the fabric. the material is soft and inviting. give them a try. you won't regret it!"
0,Really pretty but sizing off my for me Received this in the mail today and was disappointed. i typically wear a 6/8 but bought this in the 8 as i had purchased another similar top from the same company in an 8. this does not fit the same at all. the top pulled in my shoulder and chest area while had ample room in the body. needless to say i will be returning this item
0,"Disappointed Sleeves were tight, was difficult to put on ?. for the price, you want to love the shirt. sending it back."
1,"Versatile top, super comfortable This is such a great top that when my cat snagged it i bought a second version to wear in public and kept the snagged version to wear around the house or for working out. it is super comfortable and can be worn with so many things. definitely on the more casual side but you can dress it up slightly w/ jeans and booties, or it can be worn w/ leggings, jeans and tennis shoes, etc. i also bought the coral color in addition to the blue. if you're on the fence i would say you can't go wrong with buyi"
1,Lovely but... Really like this tee but i do wish it was made of another material. i like the design. simple with a nice macrame detail. the material is a very plain with much to be desired. ultimately kept the shirt but would have loved it more if it was made with something that felt better quality.
1,"Thick, soft cashmere but style is not for me I just got this in the green and i'd say the color is deeper/darker than shown. more of a turquoise-green, or muted teal color. it's the densest, thickest cashmere (it's 100% cashmere) i've felt in a while and it's so soft. but, it just doesn't look good on me. i'm 5'3"" and about 105 lbs, and usually wear xspetite. i got this in the xs regular hoping it would be long enough for leggings. and i don't think it is in the back. plus it's just too bell shaped and i'm slightly pear-shaped already. it"
0,"Unflattering cut I tried this top in xs in store.  i loved the macrame  detail and quality of fabric.  it billowed out too much below the chest and looked tent like.  my daughter laughed when she saw me in it- so did i!  i didn't buy it.  i'm 5'2"", 115#."
0,"Great design, poor execution I love the material of this shirt and i love the design; however, there is just too much fabric. it felt very boxy and gave me no shape at all. for someone who is petite this just wasn't flattering. i love the design idea though!"
0,"Adorable but runs big Lovey top in the photos. however, its fairly large and the chest area can make you look even larger. i'm 5'3, 118lbs, 36c. generally wear xs or 2s in retailer tops. ordered the xs but it was just too large and unflattering. the lace work is so pretty. it has potential but the design doesn't work well for some."
1,"So so pretty Sunday in brooklyn has been killing it lately with their tops! i could not decide between this and another of theirs, but i am glad i chose this one. first, the design is great. very cunning style: the sleeve length matches the length of the top tier, which gives this top a very finished look. the color is a beautiful jewel-like raspberry red with a bluish undertone. and, the fabric is a nice washable poly. i wore my usual size xs at retailer."
1,"Super cute This is a very cute top. i am 5'4'', 170lbs, 34dd, and a large fit great. it fit perfectly in the chest, but the top is meant to be baggy at the bottom and long (it covers my bum). looks very cute with skinny jeans. love it!"
1,"Loreley tank This is a great, effortless top. you can dress it up or down and fits true to size. it's forgiving and the straps draw your eye to the most flattering part of the body. the fabric is stretchy and and comfortable."
1,"Boxy Very cute top and nice material, but the fit is strange. there's a reason that the model has her arms at her side. the shoulders fit perfectly in my usual small, but the body is very loose. the sleeves are full, probably twice as full as seen in the pictures,which adds interest but was unexpected. also, the arm hole is wide, so the bottom seam of the sleeve attaches low on the body of the shirt, which creates an awkward silhouette. i normally love designs by whit, but i'm not sure about this one"
1,Vibrant colors! Fit great with moving room. colors very vibrant. just right for a house with lots of cool air conditioning!
1," Beautifully made shirt however the sizing is way off. the sleeves and across the chest are really tight while the rest of the shirt fits fine. if you get a size larger then the shirt in the body is to large. would recommend if you have really tiny shoulders, arms and chest. such a shame since i really love the shirt."
1,"Beautiful top This is a beautiful top but the fit is odd. it's roomy and flowy in the bust and waist but the arms are disproportionately tight. i wear a size 8 in all hd in paris tops but this one didn't fit anything like the others. i wouldn't even know what size to recommend because it's almost too big in the body, while being too tight in the arms. the lace and mock neck is beautiful though so i'm hoping to find someway to wear it comfortably. otherwise, it will be going back."
1,"The cutest! I have several lilka pj bottoms and i'm glad to add these ones with the adorable bird print to my collection! tts, soft flannel, striking colors, only wish they had pockets!"
0," This top is tight across the bust (i am a 32dd cup) and more trapeze-shaped than the picture shows. if you are smaller busted, it may not flare out as much.
also- the sz 10 is what was tight - and i usually wear a sz. 4 or 6, or small-size top/blouse.
in the end, this wasn't very flattering as it looked more like a maternity top."
0,"So sad! I was obsessed with this top. i ordered my normal 4 and was bummed about the fit in the shoulders. the slight puff was too far in, it didn't hit on my shoulder. so i returned it to a store and ordered a 6. it came quickly but it was still too narrow in the shoulders. i took it to the store and held it against the 4 and the seam was the same length between the neck and shoulder as the 4. both returned. i had no hope for an 8."
0,"Not impressed This is the first hd in paris top i haven't loved. high hopes for this top since i love the brand and the color. this was an online only item so i guessed at the size, typically order a 4 petite. ordered the 4 regular since the length was already quite short in the regular length. it was oddly constructed, small in the arms but boxy and oddly bell shaped bottom. the lining was tough to keep straightened while trying to put it
on. too bad, but it went back"
1,"Stunning dress! This dress is as stunning in person as it is in these pictures! i'm petite, and so it's longer on me than it is on the model. i got a 4p and the waist was perfect! i thought it might look matronly as it was longer, but it looks classic. i feel like i could dress it down just a bit with flats and a cardi, or wear it to an event with heals and a wrap. it's so comfortable and forgiving in the waist and belly area, which is icing on the cake! i had absolutely no reason to buy it, but once i tried it"
1,Birds in party hats This pjs are adorable!! they run tts and are extremely comfortable!
1,So comfy...so sad it didnt fit The fabric is great. the design is fun. i thought the dress would be perfect for work and also wear for a fun night out. the fit was perfect up top but the bottom part was to full and a lot longer then i expected. so i had to return it.
0," This reminded me of big bird in person and just adds volume to your body. i'm thin and usually wear a size 0, so i'm not sure who this may look good on."
1,"Soft and casual Pretty pyjama pants that can be worn running errands, dropping off kids."
1,"Absolutely gorgeous dress! This dress is a winner! the material is not stiff like many neoprene dresses - it is soft and silky and has amazing drape. the dress is very flattering! the material is very stretchy even through the waist, so it is and easy ""perfect fit"" on different body types. i loved the shorter versions of the dress, but they weren't workable for me, but this length is perfect. and there are pockets that are sewn in with perfect detailing - they don't stick out or disturb the line of the dress."
1,Stunning! I have no idea why this has bad reviews! how is there any left?! this is a beautiful piece that i had to have in both the navy and green. i love that it comes with a cami. it&#39;s very flattering and not too wide or boxy. the lace detail is amazing! i bought my usual size and it fits perfect. love this top!!
1,"Not as pictured -- better! This top in the remaining blue - green is not the top pictured.  it's like the photos posted in a recent review by inwonderland.  the color is deep and beautiful.  the neck is high, the lace is floral, there's a seam under the bust with a center pleat falling from it.  there's no reason for hesitancy at the sale price."
1,"Blue green This top is beautiful.  at the present price, grab it.  the fit was tts for me, a bit loose if anything.  the blue green color, which is not pictured, is shown in my uploaded photos."
0,"Boxy and unflattering Though the quality is good and the fabric is both sturdy and soft, the cut of this top made this a no-go for me. it's a bit short in front and also boxy, which is emphasized by the dolman sleeves. i ordered the coral color and it was much brighter - almost neon-y - as opposed to the soft salmon color my screen shows. i regretfully returned it."
1,"Super cute This dress fits really cute. i actually think it's cuter in person than on the site. really flattering. the skirt hits a few inches longer on me than it does on the model, so it's appropriate for work and networking functions. i'm 5'3, 110lbs. i got the 0 and it's great!"
1,"Birdy love Vibrant colors and birds. what's not to love? these lounge pants are so cute, soft, and comfortable. they do run a little large."
1,"Adorable sweater! When i was finally able to find my size available online, i didn't hesitate. i am 5'4"", 123lbs, 34d and size 27 jeans. i originally ordered a small...wow! was i surprised it was too small, and cropped. i returned and ordered a medium, received today...and i have to say, i was super happy. it fit perfect, in fact it fit much like how the model's fit in the photographs."
1,Cute and well made This is very practical. it goes with many things and is very comfortable....it can be worn with different leggings or with jeans! and it is well made! thanks retailer!
1," Yes, it runs very large. i usually wear a m and ordered the xs/s. i like the oversize fit and i think this poncho is unique, chic and modern. definitely worth the price, especially on sale. very nice quality fabric."
1,Adorable! Just bought this top in an xs and i can&amp;#39;t wait to wear it.  i&amp;#39;m 5&amp;#39;3 and 115 pounds. i usually stick with the petitie tops but the regular one fit me perfectly. you might need to wear a cami as it is a little see through.  a great addition to my wardrobe.
1,"Perfect for fall! This is the kind of weather i want to wrap myself up with a cozy and soft blanket. but i can't really walking around with a giant bulky blanket. this cardigan is as good as i can get. it's so soft, comfy and well made. nowadays most of the knitwear are made of dominantly polyester. this one is mostly natural material with has a much better feel than the man made kind.
i like how this garment is not too bulky and not too tight. warm enough for the breeze but not too thick. love it!"
1,"Elegant comfort I saw this online and couldn't wait to get my hands on it. my only problem was choosing a color. i got the black one. it is a bit hairy, but soft and smooth as well. it feels very high quality. it has two nicely placed buttons if you'd like it kept in place, but it's just as nice loosely draped. it will work well dressed up or down. it runs large, but clearly intended to."
1,"Unique dress with pockets This dress has a beautiful shape. it was a onesie in a store (only one they had) and i'm glad i tried it on. usually i'm a 6 or 4. this is an 8, and it's a perfect fit. definitely size up at least one dress size. the knit shoulders are beautiful and the belt is slimming. i love the writing on it. it's a classic dress and it makes me feel beautiful and unique."
0,"Beautiful fabric, irregular fit The fabric and color are absolutely beautiful. the shape of the dress is strange - fitted and tight through the waist, and enormous everywhere else. it was not flattering."
1,"Nice enough I had been looking for an off the shoulder top (or open shoulder) as the trend is really in right now, but that proves more difficult for me (muscular traps and shoulders, not always flattering)... anyway, i decided to order this ( i saw it paired with a wide-leg jeans, tucked in)... that is how i like it... tucked in. it is otherwise a little boxy on me (wide shoulders means the whole thing shifts out. the fabric si a tiny bit wrinkle-prone, but not too badly. both colors are nice, but thought"
1,Great up-to-date style! This is a great up-to-date twist on a must-have staple - a black (or grey) cardigan. easy flowing and flattering style and warm enough for fall weather.
1,"Beautiful dress small in the bust! I absolutely loved this dress, the style is flattering and the mix of fabrics and lace make it truly feminine and unique. the only problem is the bust runs really small. i normally wear a 4-6 in retailer but i ordered a 6 and and 8 and both were way to tight in the bust. very disappointed because i really wanted to keep this dress."
1,Can't bring myself to pay full price for this.... I tried this on in the store and almost considered buying it until i looked at the price tag. i think it's unique and interesting. i just don't think it's worth the $$$. the fabric is nothing special and the construction is not complicated enough to warrant the cost. i would consider it on sale. retailer has more interesting sweaters made with softer blends for a similar price - all things considered i don't think it's a smart purchase.
1,"Great short I am very glad i purchased these shorts on sale. bought the coral color in a large. 5'7"" 140lbs with a generous underside and long legs, i usually wear a m or a l in yoga pants. the l here fits really nicely--not too tight and enough length in the inseam so that i don't feel silly practicing outdoors in the park. the rise is also perfect."
0,"Not made right This has such awful proportions. i'm 5'0 and 100 lbs, ordered xxs petite (in the neutral color). the seam at the bust literally hits in the middle of my bust!! it looks very unflattering, and it's very pronounced. i'm only 5'0 and already the seam hits at such a high point on me. below the seam the sweater is all scrunched up where it's sewed, and it balloons outward and is very square from there down. very shapeless sweater and not flattering at all unless you have your arms by your sides to hi"
1,Fuzzy Wonderful sweater and fashionable for autumn. the only thing i do not like about the sweater is that it sheds very bad. bring a lint roller with you when you wear the sweater!
0,"Great dress but not for texas I purchased this dress to wear to a beach wedding. i loved the color, the fit and the style. i even got a lot of compliments on it. the problem was that the wedding was on the beach, in florida 85 degree weather and when you are sweating the fabric changes colors and takes a really really long time to return to normal! unfortunately i had to return it. would be great to wear indoors, just watch getting water or anything else on it!"
1,"Like wearing a comfy blanket I like wearing leggings with this sweater with its blanket like proportions. so soft and comfy! have only experienced minor shedding, nothing problematic."
1,"Amazing little jacket Oh just wow. this jacket is simply wonderful. ordered my regular size large and it's a bit oversized due to the swing cut and absolutely adorable on. love everything about it except the length which is very cropped. it's lightweight yet warm and very cuddly. the snap closure is wonderful. then there's the leather trim which just takes it up a notch. plenty of room for a sweater and it's lined. although it's so cropped, i think the length will be attractive worn over anything that's longer."
0,"So close I got this top planning to wear it with the sleeves up rather than off the shoulder, like in one of the photos. my regular size (medium) was way too large so i went down to a small. however, the collar was still too wide for the sleeves to stay above my bra straps. back it goes. if you're looking for a strictly off-the-shoulder top, you might like it. color is deep blue and the cotton is a nice weight."
0,"Sizing is incredibly off I tried on this sweater...love the flowing top, and it looked like the seam would hit right under my bustline.
wrong.
the seam came right across my bust on a medium; sized up to a large, same thing. this shouldn't happen! not sure who this would actually flatter.
the sweater is high quality, and the colors are perfect. the fit needs work."
0,"Sheds something fierce I have a little white dog who i'm convinced sheds hair just as fast as he can grow them. i'm constantly finding white hairs on all of my clothes and have to actively work to keep my pup from lovingly brushing his sweet little head against my favorite black leggings. this sweater is exactly like my puppy. shedding for days and long after the seasons have changed it's gorgeous and the fit is lovely, but unless you're prepared to carry a lint roller with you, i would pass this by. it's very soft an"
1,"Nice but runs really small! I was very excited to receive this dress (online only so had to have shipped.) the colors are classic primary as shown. the outer fabric is heavy and canvas-like, but the lining is white nylon-ish. the length was good. the dress is nicely lined but sadly runs very small in the bust. i am a size 8 and a 34b and this dress was too small for me. i rarely have this issue. sadly, it's going back. i should have waited to read reviews and sized up. fyi the belt has a look that appears worn similar to p"
1, Such a beautiful dress with my favorite print! it does run a size small if you ask me. the size 10 i got fits more like an 8. the corduroy belt really sets the waist off.
1,"Cute trendy top I love this top because it can be worn on or off the shoulders and looks equally as cute either way, i bought the red color and it is super cheerful and perfect for summer. looks great with faded jeans. i love the poplin fabric, although the stitching quality is shabby and i expect this won't hold up long enough to wear again next summer. for the price i feel like it should be crafted a little bit better. i am narrow shoulder'd and bra size 36 b or c and while a medium might have fit me better o"
1," Love the look, beautiful color, great length.  but with many of retailer's lace skirts, dresses and shirts the zipper did not eat to cooperate."
1," The pictures do not do this dress justice. this dress is gorgeous, the color is beautiful, and it is so flattering on. even better, this dress is machine washable! simply hang it up to dry and it looks like it is fresh from the cleaners. i love this dress so much i don't even mind that i purchased it at full price, and now it is on sale. buy this dress for a special occasion -- it is so special."
1,"Beautiful dress! This dress is beautifully made, and has a lovely sheen to it. it's elegant and can be worn on different occasions. it's a very feminine dress. i ordered the dress in a few sizes and a size 2 fit me the best as i have a small bust line."
1,"Voluminous eye catching dress Mes demosilles style incorporates lots of material. this cotton layered, voluminous dress is an eye catcher but not for all figures. i like this bohemian style because it is different and can be worn with a belt to show off more of your figure or loose fitting. 
i ordered a 36 size which fitted perfectly around the bust but i have broad shoulders and there is no zipper. i had to purchase the 38 size so i could remove the dress over my shoulders without too much trouble."
1,"Riley tunic So soft and pretty, but the fit is off on me. i'm an xs/0 and the seam on this hits right across my bust. with the 3/4 length sleeves it makes the whole thing look like it shrunk in the wash. on my pre-teen daughter however it looks perfect, so i guess i'd say size up if you have boobs!"
1,Even better than photo Love this sweater. comfy and trendy. can't wait to wear with my new retailer knit leggings!
0,Wanted to love but couldn't. Runs small. arms very short and hits in the wrong place across your chest. would not recommend.
1,"My new favorite dress Whimsical and elegant. fits a bit snug in rib cage, but that works well for me. i'm a 32c."
1,"Amazing design and unique style! This dress is absolutely gorgeous! the top portion fit a little smaller than the typical size i order. the zip side was a little snug, but the fit is very flattering! the lace detail and belted design are very pretty. the skirt portion has more volume than i tend to like, but it is it beautiful!"
1,"Very nice I saw this online & wondered abt the sleeve length on me. i was thinking about ordering the petite size since i'm only 5'3"". sometimes cardigans have longer sleeves than i want. it was at the local store so i tried on the regular xs in the grey. the fit & sleeve length was fine. what i didn't care for was a slight itchiness (wool fiber) & some mild shedding (alpaca fiber). i decided against it but it is nice looking. 5""3"", 117#"
0," Hahaha..this dress is hilarious! it looks nothing like the image! i am usually a 0/xs, and 4 was the smallest size available, so i ordered it. when i opened it, it felt like 10 lbs of fabric. i thought maybe i ordered a size way too big, until i could barely squeeze into the top of the dress. once i looked in the mirror, i almost fell over laughing. the rest of the dress is huge. i don't believe this dress would be flattering on anyone."
1,"Full but pretty I ordered this in an xl and when i pulled it out of the bag, it seemed huge. (i wear both l and xl, depending on the sizing) when i tried it, it did look like the photo - it's meant to be a little voluminous. the arms were a little snug, so sizing down was out of the question. it looks great tucked in to a pair of flair jeans. i gave the asthetic four stars because of the design, which is just a teeny bit off. the lace is delicate too, btw, so care will be needed not to snag it."
1,"Great item! This tunic is flattering and high quality, just be sure you size down!"
1,"Fun top This top is cute. i got the mint coloured one and like it. with that said, the sewing however is a bit off. the bottom of the top is angled. there is no mention of that in the description so it is safe to say it is not part of the design. it is not tremendously noticeable,  but i noticed it. i will still keep this top, coz i can camouflage that defect with a cardigan.  it is sheer, so if you are wearing it for work without cover, a camisole would be required or a nude bra. i am 5'0"", 109lbs, and"
1,Great color Great top.  high quality.  could use some stretch.   recommend it!
1,Too short This is a great top except i wish it was a bit longer or i wish it came with a short tank. it hits right at my pants which wouldn't be terrible (although not ideal) except my tank that i need to wear under it is long and so i either need to tuck it in or it will hang past the shirt. neither is what i was hoping for. still like it so debating whether to take it back. i think at full price i will return and consider it again it it makes it to sale.
1,Itchy This top is lovely but also a little bit itchy. the detail around the neck is beautiful but it's very annoying. i can't decide if i will keep it or not.
1,"Not for everyone This is too much fabric for me (115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist, short) even in the smallest size, but i saw another costumer try it on and it was sooo lovely.  the fabric has a shimmery thread, very pretty. the cut was super flattering on her curvier body, it was gorgeous. she tried it on with boots, and also put on a long vest over it every way was beautiful, jsut not on me, sadly. so i say give it a try, may work for you."
1,"Summer go-to dress! This dress is as comfortable as it is adorable. i am 6'2"" and usually wear 12/14 but the 10 fit me. love, love, love this dress!!"
1,"Nice top, but large I wanted to love this top, but similar to many of retailer's styles (especially this season), this top is very large and tent-like. normally i like a larger top, but i was not expecting the length of this top. it might be cute belted if that is your style, but still much more like of a tunic than a top - could also make a nice maternity top. i am 5'7"" and ordered a medium and this top hit me much lower than pictured on the model. the fabric and pattern, as well as the neckline are very nice"
0,"Great concept that just misses the mark I received this jumpsuit today in size medium. i am normally a size 4-6. overall, the jumpsuit fit. i am 5' 8.5"" tall and the length was fine if i wore flats. the issue with this jumpsuit is the bottom half. the top jersey wrap part fit great--nice and stretchy, fit nicely on the curves. the problem is that the wrap part stops at your rib cage and the pants begin somewhere way up high, definitely on the rib cage. the gathering of the pants gave me a pooch where i don't have one, but the deal kil"
1,"Love this dress! Super cute on.  i love the print and the tie detail and the fact that the tie actually tightened which makes the waste adjustable.    the slip is a tad tight, but it doesn't bother me, its stretchy so it's not uncomfortable.  i bought size xs-i usually wear a 2 in dresses.  i usually buy petite because of the length but this fell about 2"" above the knee on me which is perfect for work so i didn't need the petite.  i am 5'3"", 125 lbs.  i loved the soft fabric-fine for year round in southern cal."
1,Perfect for short girls This dress is lovely and easy to wear if you are short and you buy regular size (not petite). i am 5'1 and i bought the regular medium so the length of the front falls just above my knees. i can wear it to work without leggings. the other thing i love is it has pockets! and it fits generously - i weigh 140 lbs and will usually fit in a medium (if i don't breathe) and a large (if i use a belt). but in this size (medium regular - i can breathe! and i need a belt. ergo - i don't feel like i need to
0,"Odd design The design is very strange. the inner slip is quite form-fitting, but the dress on top was just massive, like a sack. on the sides were tassels that i could not figure out what to do with. they looked weird just hanging off the side, so i tried to knot them like a belt. overall, this dress was not attractive on. it looks much better on the model. the coloring on the snakeskin print dress is also different in real life, harsher red, blue, and white print not the dusty rose and plum pictured."
1,"Effortless style Lovely jumpsuit. can be dressed up or down. i agree with the other reviewers that in my normal medium, the torso length is a bit short, making the garment pull. i sized up to a large, and with room in the hips and the correct torso length, the jumpsuit works. the bust is cut for a smaller gal. for reference, i am 5'7"", 36a, 155lb."
1,"Beautiful! Beautiful lace shell! great with jeans for a night out, or with a skirt for a more formal affair. good quality, not itchy."
1,Nice top No complaints about this top. i like that it's very soft and the length is good as a tunic. would recommend.
0,"All legs jumper! This is really a lovely jumper and looks quite nice and dressy on. my problem is a short torso, but then again this may be made for short torso loving people! i felt like i was all legs in it. i never asked anyone else's opinion, though, so not sure if its just me and my complex.
if you don't have a short torso,then you might experience the pulling the others were speaking about because the waist might hit you higher than your usual waist.

overall, i am not sure who this was designed for.. but"
1,"Sweet tunic Definitely size down it does run large however, it is a sweet floral print made of rayon so i would dry clean as rayon shrinks. i love tunic lengths and this one is a bit longer than most tunics but for me still works. there are 2 small pleats on the front and the ruffles on the neckline are a nice touch. it is made well. i have a long black sweater that will make this work right into the fall and winter."
1,"Great details, on trend I fell in love with this top online. i am obsessed with the little flounce detail on the sleeve and the slight a-line shape of the body. i was able to try it on in store and was glad i did because i ended up sizing up to a small from my usually x-small. i still put ""true to size"" because i think the forgiving cut allows the top to work in multiple sizes. i even tried on a medium and it still looked like it fit. the arms are a bit tight, as the other reviewer mentioned so keep in mind when choosi"
1,"Love!!! Really cute top! love the ruffle detailing and the pattern. quality could be slightly better since i slightly expected the material to be softer. either way, i'm happy with the top. got my usual xs and it fit perfectly. it's meant to be a looser top so i don't mind that it runs a little bigger."
1," I absolutely loved the look of this top and had to try it on, so i ordered it in xs and s because i own a few other tylho shirts and know they can run large. when they arrived, i could tell with just one look how huge this top runs. i didn't even bother opening the s. for reference, i'm 5'4"" and 135lb, 32c, and the xs is slightly too big through my bust. it's barely snug underneath my arms and not at all fitted down the sides of my ribcage, but i'm okay with that since it allows more room to wea"
1,"Lightweight, but that's ok. I bought this dress with my birthday coupon, i love the design of the fabric, and i think the length is great. it's a lightweight dress, which makes it a nice for more seasons. sandals in the summer, light sweater in the spring/fall, and tights, slip, and heavy sweater in the winter. the underarms wrinkled a lot the first time i wore it, which makes sense because i was wearing a sweater. the rest of the dress did not wrinkle at all. very satisfied!"
0," I really wanted this dress to be perfect, but the skirt portion flares out in a way that was not flattering. the other reviewer is about 8 inches taller than me, perhaps it works better on a taller frame."
0, Really wanted to love this top...it is beautiful with very good quality but...ran small and tight...also the bottom sides flare out as if it was stitched with too much material looking awkward...
1," Love the design of this denim dress. so unique! i did buy a size larger than i would have normally looked at based on reviews. if on the fence, go up but do get this one. it has no stretch, so a size 8 waist measures 15"" flat, with 17 under the arms. not really for big busted girls. i am 5'8"" and the length is right at lower knee. worth the sale price for sure!!"
1,"Flattering This dress is fun and flattering. love the pieced denim look and the a-line style. unlike other reviewers, i found this dress to be true to size for my pear-shaped figure. the length is long enough to wear anywhere, and i think it would be flattering on a variety of ages and figures."
1,"Great piece I was very patient with this dress. i was waiting almost forever till this dress gets on sale. when i tried my usual 6 size it was way too tight but i could zip it. ( i am 5'6'' 145 lbs). the dress covers my knees and it's a perfect length, so when i sit it does not show too much of my length so it's a work friendly. it has side pockets, which can be very comfortable as well. the cut is great, it's a line,the thickness of material makes belly look great (in case if you care). i also like color a"
1,"Selling out... I ordered this on a whim as i though, hey, i don't have off the shoulder tops let's try ti, looks cute...
i ordered the nude after debating, but glad i did, it is a bit warmer in color, and i need warm colors to complement my pale skin. teh nude almost has a slight pink hue to it (maybe i am seeing things). it is soft, not sure there is wool, i am not that sensitive to wool, felt soft to me.

1,"Soft and beautiful! This is a great skirt and i have received so many compliments wearing it. it's soft as butter and adorable with the ruffle on the bottom. i do find it runs small. i usually wear a 27 in jeans or a small in various tops and bottoms (and occasionally find i can fit in a 26 or xs) but i purchased a medium in this skirt. this is a very versatile piece. so far i have worn it to work (i'm 5'6"" and it's not inappropriately short at all) with tights, heels, and a jacket, but i'm excited to style it for"
1,Great dress! Purchased this in two sizes because other reviews said it runs small. i found that it was true to size for me .cant wait until it is warm enough to wear it!
1,"Heavy material I love this dress because it is different and unique. i agree with others that the torso runs tight. i got lucky and it still fits snuggly. i think that's the look the upper part should get with the bottom more a-line and flowy. 
it's super cute though. the material is truly jeans material, therefore quite heavy and think. maybe not a dress for summer. more spring or fall with a little sweater."
1," Love! the perfect go-to black legging! i bought two pair! comfy waist band/not too tight, no muffin top! you won't be disappointed. buy them!"
1,Lovely top I've been looking for an off the should sweater like this for over a year! looks great on and doesn't itch! can't wait for fall so i can wear it!
1,"Elegant top, beautiful details. The lace on this is gorgeous. it's feminine and elegant and fancy! definitely know if peplum style tops work for you before purchasing. if you have a large waist, it will just make you look bigger. but the top portion is nice and fitted, so i think it's very flattering. i'm 34c, 140b and got the small. fits great."
0," I love holding horses and i am always be size 2 in their clothes (32dd, 5'3"", curvy). i ran into my local retailer to grab a shirt they had on hold and had to try this on because it's so cute. i couldn't get the 2 zipped and it seemed to be rather narrow in the torso. such a bummer!"
1,"Perfect dress for anytime Based on the reviews of others, i ordered this dress a size larger than i usually wear and it fits perfect. i am an 8, so i got this in a 10. this is the perfect casual dress for pretty much anytime of the year -can be worn with sandals in the spring and summer, or boots in the winter."
1,"Love demin! Love this dress. very comfortable and stylish. wanted my size. but they only had a size larger available. still bought it, but feel good in it. glad i purchased it."
0,"Unless you know a seamstress, don't bother After reading all the reviews, i ordered up a size. the problem isn't that it runs small. it's that they took the bodice of a true size and stuck it on the skirt of a small size. or if you want to think of it differently - the bodice of a large size on to the skirt of a true size. the 4 top with the 6 bottom would be perfect. unfortunately - you get a size 4 fitted bodice with a skirt that puckers at the back and shows all your flaws (spare tire) or a size 6 that is atrociously long in the torso"
1,"Excellent fit! After reading all reviews, i didn?t know what to expect, but i really loved the design so i ordered it any way. how positively surprised i was! this dress has a structure. the fit is great, just right in all places. the length hits right at the knee. i was afraid it would be too heavy for a denim dress, but it is actually thin and soft, not hot at all. for better understanding of the fit, i am 5?7?, 144 lb. and 34c. i?m between s and m in tops because of my wide shoulders, but size 8 in this dre"
1,"So interesting & unique The weight of this denim is perfect, thin enough for a nice drape and wearability for all seasons but still thick enough to be structured. though there is absolutely no stretch, which is probably why so many are finding it to run small. i am a true size 6, but find that most retailer brands run quite large, therefore i usually wear a 4 and that's what i purchased in this dress. the bodice is a bit snug, but not enough to size up, for me personally. i know it's mostly a spring/summer dress,"
0,"Runs very small Tried this dress on today in the store. i am a size 10, sometimes a size 8. the size 12 was the first size i tried that zipped all the way up. however it was still very tight around my stomach and bust. and then from having to size up, it flared out too much at the bottom for my liking"
0,"Still undecided Having read all the reviews, i still (bravely) ordered in a size 2 (i can be a 0 or 2 in this brand)...first reaction? adorable style. second reaction? who was the model for this? i am pear shaped, and not short waisted, but the waist is low, and the top is snug...afraid a 4 would be too much top, but don't relish constantly pulling the dress down to keep the waist where it should be. am going into my local mall store, to see if they do have a 4...perhaps that will be better. really hesitant to"
1,"Comfortable and cozy This top is ""comfort wear"" or something i would wear to feel comfortable and cozy on the weekends but not something i would wear to work. because of that it is not an item i would traditionally purchase at retailer. that said, it is one of the best comfort clothing pieces i have found in a long time and i fell in love with it. i like the color which is good for transitioning into spring time, it is a thicker material which is great for transitional weather but also makes me more comfortable"
1,"Recommendation with qualifier This gorgeous dress arrived today. the color is beautiful, but the sizing? way off. i cannot move my arms -- it is extremely snug across the shoulders. but, the rest of the dress is loose, as shown in the picture. if i went up a size to fit my shoulders, i'd be swimming in this dress. so, all you gals out there with anthletic tendencies: beware of this dress. it is for women without shoulders/with tiny arms. too bad. this is otherwise gorgeous & would look great worn over a sexy slip with the bo"
1,"Beautiful color! This color is perfect: deep and rich. it is exactly as it looks on-line. the velvet is super-soft on the outside, while the inside is more of a woven finish. it makes it a little less cozy, but the drape is great. the fit is slim across the shoulders and chest, and full everywhere else. the waist is lower in the back than the front, so it sits lower on the hip. i'm 5'4, 140, 34b, and i got a small petite, because i liked where it hit my waist better. this means i won't be wearing it without tigh"
1," I was looking for a velvet dress for the holidays. this one was beutiful in color and teksture.
the only problem was that it was snug in the shoulders. going a size up would have made it too roomy elswhere."
1,Really nice It's just not for me and i really like it. it's made very well and it looks great from the front. not so much from the side. i'm a 36c and this shirt bells out a lot from my chest...so much that i will be returning it. i look like i have an extra 20 lbs. on me.
1,"... just not for me... I was very excited to try out this dress. i've been looking for a velvet dress for a couple of years now, and.. i'm not digging this one. the fabric itself was a let down right off the bat. it's cheap looking to me. i've seen nice velvet and this is very shiny, thin, and slightly sheer! the dress cut itself is what i was expecting, a loose baby doll type dress. the length hit above my knees. the overall effect made me feel very ""gypsy-ish""...my husband gave a firm no! when he saw me walk out of"
0,"Not worth it I can't believe the reviews this dress has gotten. i ordered it and was so excited to get it. when i tried it on all of my excitement was gone. while i love the color the quality just isn't there and its not worth the money even with the 25% discount i used. the fabric is not thick, in fact it is quite sheer for ""velvet"". i honestly wouldn't feel comfortable with out a slip on underneath this. second is the fit. i'm 5'6 32a, xs on top 4 on bottom and i ordered an xs and the way this hung on me w"
1,Love these! This is the 4th pair of current/elliot jeans i've bought.  i'm 5'4 so the length is perfect for flats.  they are so soft and cozy. wish they had a design on the pockets but love them none the less!
0," I returned this one. i usually love cecilia prado? s artistic textiles and was very happy with her floraknit dress, but this skirt was a disappointment . it simply looks different from the picture : it?s way more shimmery- metallic in person, (which i could see a lot of customers actually loved), but to me it made it look cheap. also it lacks structure: the a-shape looks drab on this knit fabric."
1,"Beautiful skirt Fit, length and design were perfect. i took this skirt on a recent business trip and it transitioned perfectly from meetings to cocktail with an accessory change."
0,"Cute leggings but poor quality fabric. These are very cute leggings. i love the ribbed bottoms. as far as design and comfort, they are a five. but after only two wearings, they are pilling like crazy and look shabby. i'm very happy i only paid $23 for them. if i paid full price, i'd be more upset."
1,"Just one negative.... This is a beautiful sweater. the color is not bright red, rather a dark coral. nonetheless it is much better looking in person than in the web photo. i only have one complaint which may be reason enough for me to return an otherwise perfect sweater. i wore this for approximately three hours today and could not believe the pilling under the arms and side of chest area. some pilling is normal and expected on any sweater but if this continues at the rate it appears to be going, i will contact retailer"
1," I really liked these leggings, so comfy! they are so soft and the waistband is thick(about an inch wide). i am a size 10 in pants, i got a size m. i have a 33 inch inseam and these came down to my ankles. these leggings have textured stripes at the calf and hip."
1,"Beautiful but fragile This skirt is gorgeous- the picture doesn't do it justice. it has beautiful sparkle and glitter in the material. i received tons of compliments on it. the biggest downside is the material- it seems to snag and pull so easily. in a short 2 hours of wearing it, the material was already pulled in two different places. i will keep the skirt because it is so pretty but have to not get upset when the material gets worse over time."
1,Better even than the picture This skirt is shimmery without being too much. rich colors and perfect fit tts nice elastic middle so comfortable and gorgeous.
1,"Go see in the store! Online photos do not do this skirt any justice i agree with a previous poster. i normally never buy anything brown, but there are pops of teal and magenta throughout. you can't see the gorgeous shimmer and the interesting layered colors online. in addition, this skirt has a stretch waistband (plus for the holidays!) and is so flattering, not too tight, but shows just enough of your curves, physique. i like that the skirt is longer as well - will look cute with boots. i purchased the size medium"

1,The picture does not do this skirt justice! When i got this skirt i figured it was a muted sweater skirt. what i got was a much fancier sparkly sweater skirt. the blue is more of a bright sparkly teal and gold thread is woven throughout. oh my it's spectacular. really beautiful.
1,"Beautiful! I've been searching for a velvet top or dress for awhile. this arrived yesterday and it's absolutely beautiful. the color is rich and the fabric is thick and feels and looks like a very expensive, high quality item. i got it with the 25% off promo but it's worth every penny of the full price. can't wait to wear for the holidays! get this dress!"
1,"Love I love this dress--i saw it on the way out of the store and was struck by the gorgeous color and rich velvet fabric and had to touch it and then try it on. i did not find it to be tight in the shoulders at all, nor do i think it looks cheap--on the contrary. the shape is indeed boxy, but it is still very flattering and comfortable. i wore it to a christmas brunch and got a ton of compliments. the only drawback for me is that it has to be dry cleaned. for reference, i am 5'6 1/2"" and usually wear"
1,"Awesome top I love this shirt! red + navy is one of my fave color combos, and the vintage feel is fantastic. the fabric is a little thicker and more sweater-like than i was expecting, but it's a good thing. the top isn't heavy, but the knit gives it more texture & interest.
this is the perfect thing to throw on for a casual sexy look...covered, but form-fitting and flattering."
1,"Fabric fantastic Got this dress in the mail today, and will have to say that it is not the most figure flattering dress i own. my 5'5"" athletic frame looks pretty boxy in this. that being said, the fabric is a soft, shiny blue/green. the garment swings nicely and has a slightly lower hem in the back (on me, anyway) and i think that's fun. who needs close fitting clothes during the holidays ? i'm keeping it. i plan to wear it with hot pink tights and boots."
1,"Great for somebody with less jelly belly Either this rouching is going to accentuate your waist or it's going to accentuate the fact that you just had a baby and ate too much linguini. unfortunately i have 10 more pounds to go and sadly this dress pointed that out.

that said, i had to give it five stars all around because it's good quality, design, etc.. it'll be great but not for me. 

got a medium and it fit nicely (with the exception of pointing out that i still have baby belly to lose)-- 5'3, 34d, 150 pounds. hope this was hel"
1,"Buttery soft These jeans are extremely soft to the rich, as well as stretchy and flattering. they do not lose their shape after a whole day of wear. i am 5'3"" and the ankle length fits me as full length. i am a big fan."
0,"Different fabric and looser cut I ordered these along with the regular ag stevie jeans and there is a definite difference in fabiric and cut. i liked the darker fabric but it was thinner and stretchier that the more ""denim"" version. the cut was also looser in the thigh and seat area which made for a looser, less flattering fit. returned it and kept the regular ag stevie."
1,Not ideal I was not a fan of these leggings. these were very unflattering. i could see that after wearing these all day they could start stretch out. i just didn't feel like they would hold up for even one season.
0,"Not the boyfriend jean i was looking for These jeans look slouchy and shorter in the pic which was exactly what i was looking for, but they fit more like regular boot cuts on me and proved to be much longer than expected. i have fairly long legs and most jeans hit me like they do on the models, but these were very long. i only buy citizens of humanity and paige jeans and i can almost always buy online for them when it comes to skinny jeans, but these did not fit the same as their other styles. they are good quality and would probably f"
1,"On me, not flattering I tried this on in the store yesterday and i wanted to buy it very much. the jacket would work well for many sleveless tops or dresses all summer, and would work in an office. but, on me, the unusual cut of the arms emphasized the worst part of my arms (saggy or fat area) in a comical manner. if they tried to design a garmet to make arms look bad, the couldnt have done it better. further, the extra material against the body added bulk at my narrowest point (i am hourglass). again, not flattering"
1,Lovely 3 season dress I am very pleased with the quality and fit of this dress.the reader outfits next to the listing were darling. i do not care for the model shot. i think the dress is true to size and well constructed.
1,"Oh my Oh look i have a booty and would look at that--i have a waist too!  yes this dress is way casual for its price point (soft stretch jersey in a heathered wine color) but it's all forgiven because it fits me like a glove.  i really love the gathered waist detail and what it visually does to my non-hourglass body. wish there were more colors available, i would pick them up in a heartbeat.  i purchased the medium petite.  my stats for fit reference:  5'3"" tall, 140#, 36dd, 28"" waist, 35"" hips, wide"

1,Cute casual leggings I've never owned sweater leggings before so these were my first. i had to order large because well i have some junk in the trunk (am 10/12 on bottom and 8 on top). these are a teeny bit scratchy but i'm hoping with a wash they'll soften up--but they're really loose too so i'm also hoping they'll shrink a teensy bit.
1,So cute This skirt is a dream. so so beautiful. looks way cute with brown boots. give this a go. don't listen to any negative review. this skirt is perfection.
0,"Sad from ms designs I finally found this dress in store today and wow! i cannot believe this cheap looking dress is from ms! they have been among the top at retailer and this unlined, baggy, cheap velvet sub is a shock! what happened? only the color is nice. please get back to yourself ms!"
1,Comfy leggings These leggings are super comfy. i took the advice of other reviewers and ordered a size down and the leggings fit wonderfully. lately i've been having a problem with leggings falling down at the waist and these stay up nicely so i was very pleased. the leggings have a slight itch because of the sweater feel but they are very warm and i enjoy wearing them.
1,"So its green---- I don't know how this dress looks on your monitor. on mine - it looks dark green. which it is! i was pleased with this aspect since i had hoped it would be as pictured despite the color description as ""slate."" that aside, it was a bit too large on me, and since i am on the shorter side at 5'4"", i looked a bit like a child's doll in it. i wish it had looked better on me because the color is beautiful, and so is the quality."
1,"Can't go wrong with a cashmere sweater! Beautiful sweater!! i love the color and the fit. the cowl neck isn't too tight and the sweater hangs away from the body without being boxy. it comes down to the low hip on me. very soft and cozy. i purchased the aqua in xs. fits perfectly and i'm 5"" 5' 127lbs."
1,"Gorgeous! pics don't do them justice! I thought these were pretty on the website, but in person they look like a work of art! the colors are vivid -- bright reds, pinks, greens, blues, yellow -- with flora, fauna, houses, writing, type and so many other things on a white and cream background. they are very soft, medium-weight flannel. for me they run true to size. i wish they had pockets, though!"
1,"Perfect hooded long vest I've been looking for exactly this. i really love it. it is heavy, but made extremely well and on sale a great price!"
1,"Best retailer purchase of the season I've tried or bought nearly every retailer cashmere sweater this season. this one fits the best and the yellow is a bit darker in person, not quite mustard but a deep rich yellow. i wish they would offer more colors."
1, Love these lounge pants. i live in florida and was worried they might be too heavy. not the case at all. very soft and lightweight. so comfortable!!!
0,"Enormous I was really excited about this sweater, but the fit was terrible. the sleeves were the right size, but the body of the sweater was a tent - absolutely no shape. they must have clipped the sweater on the model. for reference, i'm 5'4 and 120 pounds and ordered a size small."
1, Caught a sale in oct and purchased the gray. beautiful light gray. i am normally a med or lg and the small in this sweater was perfect. i am larger in the bust so it is not boxy on me. added a delicate pin to the shoulder and it was darling for our casual christmas dinner.
1,"Love it! Beautiful color, great style/design. only drawback is it's not as soft as other cashmere i've purchased...got the xs and the fit is perfect!"
1," Looking for a stylish rain resistant coat to wear to ireland this fall and looks like this could fit the bill. the 30inch length is perfect. the faux fur lined collar and opening edges is a lovely touch, fur ends about 6 inches in so not fully lined, but great for weather in 50's-low 60's with a sweater added . ample room for that. i love the look, wish the pockets were just a bit bigger, i can barely fit my hand in. but overall i think it's a keeper.
i ordered m/l and am usually a medium or la"
1,Beautiful I bought this in aqua. the color is beautiful. the quality of the cashmere is great. i have worn this 3 times since purchasing! this can be dressed up or down. the cowl neck is not overwhelming and looks great with a shorter chunky necklace or even a scarf. flattering hem line. very versatile.
1,Elegant blouse Shirt fits great! i wore it for work and got lots of complements. looks very elegant. i also got the pants featured on the model since i liked the outfit so much ;)
0,"On the fence I love cashmere, love the length, cowl-neck and colors, however i found the yellow to be bit more vibrant in person, which i liked. i'm not sure i will keep this because it seemed to be a bit too thin for my taste. i would gladly pay a bit more for a thicker ply sweater... i might justify this one at a sale price."
1," Beautiful piece, very well made and drapes well!!! i love it!!!! runs a little big, i'd go a size smaller."
1," Very cute in person, too. soft to the touch and comfy. as a person on the shorter side the roll up cuffs sold me on these pants! can't wait for it to get cool enough to wear them."
1,"Nice cami with cute detail I love camisoles like this, and retailer always has great ones! it has a nice length, so the lace detail can show underneath a jacket or shorter cardigan. it's fitted, but not tight."
1,"Try it! you'll love it! This is a beautiful sweater. high quality cashmere was used as it is very soft. as other reviewers stated, the sweater does run large. so i purchased one size down and ordered an xxs, for a perfect fit. i went with yellow, which is a great color. this is not high low, which i love! i am so thrilled, that just as soon as i'm finished writing this review, i'm going to purchase another sweater in red."
1,"Classy, sophisticated I bought this blouse in a size 4 (my normal size) to pair with winter white slacks and gun metal pumps. it was a hit. i felt beautiful and professional. and received many compliments at work as well as at an after work gathering the quality is surprisingly sturdy given the lace work. the collar and cuffs really set the design off. this top is much more impressive in person."

This skirt is gianormous! i usually take an xl or l, so i ordered both. the waistband on the xl was so huge, i didn't even try it on. i feared it would not stay up! so i tried the large, and it was big as well. i think i would have needed a medium. but as it is, it is not the cute a-line that appears in the picture. (i wonder how they even got it to look like that !?!?!) it is huge, hip-y, and bunchy. yuck."
1," Bought the aqua because sizes were sold out. the bright color will be a welcome change this winter among all my neutrals. it's lovely, soft, well-fitting, and i only hope we have a few days in the south so i can wear it. well worth the price. would be a lovely wardrobe addition for any age, changed by what it's worn with...shoes, accessories,"
1,Beautiful shirt! This shirt is beautiful and well-made. the lace is soft - not scratchy at all. looks great with a cream or gray cami underneath.
1,"Most comfy flannel jammies ever Love, love these flannel sleep pants. i bought a pair 3 years ago and have been on the look out for the style again. these are truly the most comfortable pajama pants i have ever owned."
1," I recently ordered this and am so glad i did. i absolutely love it! my hips and butt are not tiny, so i was very nervous that this would be a giant pouf on my lower half, but it lays perfectly flat and has a very gentle a-line, contrary to other comments. i am 5'4"" and 130' but the xs fits perfectly and keeps me looking trim. the waist sits just barely below my natural waist. very happy with this purchase; would buy more if there were additional colors - who doesn't love an elastic-waisted skirt"
1,Amazing maxi Bought this dress in store after trying it on. loved it. it's sexy with the lower cut front. the fabric is flowy and breathable. runs true to size. usually wear a 10 with my hips but the 8 fit better on top.the sides are well designed so your bra doesn't show. i'm 5''6' 32g size 29/30 jeans and athletic/hourglass built. i can't wait to wear it out. the pictures don't do it justice.
1,"Nice change from denim I really like these shorts. i'm quite petite and have a hard time finding shorts to fit other than high end denim brands. these are great b/c of the sizing, i wear a 24 in most denim and the 24 in these fit perfectly. also love the length, not too short or long! going to order a second color, i have the plum and love it."
1," Ordered this is the navy in a size m.....i'm 5' 5"", 135 lbs, 34d. it was huge!!! it is also very billowy but i'm going to try it in a petite s. i also changed colors to the ivory as the navy was really plain. hoping this size change works!"
1,Variety of colors I couldn't wait to try on these shorts after reading all the positive reviews about them. my local retailer had them in the bright blue and coral in my size 26 and 25. i purchased the 26 and am content with them. they are a very lightweight cool pair of shorts. they do have a little stretch to them and the length is perfect.. i have to note they do wrinkle a bit but perfect summer staple. .
1,"My new favorite top This top is wonderfully comfortable and well made. i've taken a few accidental naps while wearing it because i was just so comfortable. at the same time, i receive complements on the shirt every time i wear it. itt pairs well with so many types of pants. the only negative is that i only own one (the cream color). i regret greatly that i did not purchase it in all available colors when i had the chance! i really hope to see this top come back again later!"
1, The color was very different and vibrant. chose to size up for extra room and length
0,Extremely small pant! Very small! so disappointed! they did not even have a size for me to exchange a day later when they arrived!
1,"Very short This runs very short. i had to size up so i could wear as a dress. still too short to wear to work with a cardi but adorable to wear to daytime summer events and date nights with hubby. i am 5'6"". length may work better for shorter women. love the style and fabric. very feminine, float and easy to wear with sandals on a hot summer day."
0,"Not for larger chests I ordered this online, and when i opened the package, i was impressed with the quality of the material and stitching for this top. it is much nicer than a basic t-shirt.

when i tried this on, the band of stitching that was supposed to go beneath my chest was sitting on top of my cleavage! also, the overall length is listed as 27"" long, but i think that is the back of the shirt. the front of the shirt is very short on me (i'm 5'10""), hitting well above my hip bones.

if only this was much, m"
1,"Subtly soft I purchased this in the light red, and love it!!! this top is so incredibly soft and ridiculously comfortable.  definitely worth buying.  the material is high quality and can easily shift from season to season.  wear alone with shorts and wedges for summer or put it over a long sleeve top,  or even a holding horses jean shirt with a pair of black leggings and boots for fall.  
absolutely love the softness and the consistency of the fabric."
1,Great shorts These shorts are very flattering. will def. purchase another pair.
1,"So soft and flowy This tunic is a great length - i'm 5'4"" and it hits me mid/lower thigh. it's so soft and flowy which i love. i got a medium which is my normal size so i would say it runs a little big given that i'm almost 5 months pregnant with my second but it will still look and feel great post baby. arm holes are big but a cami can fix that. i got both colors available: the ivory and light red."
1,So cute I love this!!!! nice and lightweight. super stylish
1," This skirt is adorable. i like it because its different and i like this length. the cactus look gray in the picture, but they are green."
1,"Love this, great for larger chests I *love* this tunic. i'm 5'5"" and can wear it as a dress with bike shorts or leggings. it is so soft and comfortable, and i love the pink color--very versatile. my favorite thing about this piece--i am a 36dd and haven't bought a button down shirt in years until this tunic, which fits over my chest and is so flattering! many reviewers are saying that this tunic runs large--i agree, but for those of us who are busty, it's an opportunity to wear a cute, breezy style with buttons and a collar!"
0,"Makes me look pregnant I normally wear regular s, but even the xsp is too wide on me. it is really maternity wear. 

also, since the material is thin, the ivory is too shear for my liking."
1,"Great length, true to size despite initial snug These shorts are comfortable and are just the right length. i have the blue and it isn't as bright as shown in the pictures, but it's a great color nonetheless that coordinates well with many wardrobe items. when i tried on my usual 25, i found the waist fit a bit snug so i bought the 26 for a comfortable fit. i should've stayed with my usual size though, because after wearing for an entire day, the shorts loosened up quite a bit and developed a saggy look to them. i'm so disappointed with this"
1,Beautiful dress This dress is so beautiful in person. i actually am currently wearing it with jeans and i get so many compliments on it. this picture on the website does not really do it justice. very flowy beautiful top/dress.
1,"I've been looking... This is another ""i've been looking"" for me - a funnel-neck sweatshirt to feign athleticism with. i love it. the material is incredibly soft and warm. the fit is a little snug around a larger bust, and the lines would probably be more flattering on a more... well, modelesque... frame. but i'm thoroughly attached. size up if you're looking for movement."
1, I ordered it online so i wasn't sure how thick the sweater coat would be and when i received it i was pleasantly surprised at the thickness and high quality. definitely worth the price!
1,Perfect maxi I agree with the other reviews! perfect color and weight to the dress. should wear well in summer and fall. i'm 5'5'' 34c 140lbs athletic and got the 6 regular. fit well and the length was perfect with flats.
1,"Perfect shorts I love these shorts! they are cuter in person than online. they fit perfectly--casual, somewhat loose, airy feeling. i am 5'3, 105 lbs, took my usual size 25. i wear shorts a little lower on my waist, and i prefer the looser fit. if you plan to wear them up higher on your waist, you can probably size down, but i didn't want to worry about shrinkage, and i wanted them to be easy and comfy. they washed nicely (machine wash, cold, laid flat), light iron touch up. i ordered in moss green, nice color"
1,"Breezy & comfy This top does run large. i'm 5'8 142 lbs and usually a medium. i bought a small and probably could have gone xs. that said, i love this top. its soft and comfy and swingy. i bought the light red and its pretty true to the online color."
1,"Soft fabric and nice details, billowy design This top is not quite what i expected, but it is good quality and very comfortable. looking at the tall, willowy model in the pictures, i thought the top would be about tunic length and hang straight down. in reality, the design adds volume to your frame by cutting out in a kind of a-line from shoulder to mid-thigh. in fact, the shirt is so long and has so much flare that i think if i had ordered the regular size rather than a petite it would actually make a cute dress. for reference, i'm 5'4"" a"
1,"Stretchy Love the length, cut, & placement of pockets. the stretch has positive & negative consequences, though. minuses: easily wrinkled, grow 2 sizes within the day. pluses: comfy, bendy, they're designed to be more of an active short, so the wrinkles & give are quite fine (they only stretch in unnoticeable areas). if we're to repurchase, i'd size down--but i love the bright color  & comfort so much i'm keeping these as is. (i'm a 6-8, should have purchased the 27's.)"
1,"Easy top I like this top. another reviewer mentioned that it was a great top for a busty girl...i agree. i'm a 32g and could have sized down to a small, but i kept the medium because i wanted the extra length to have the option of wearing it as a dress. the small may have caused slight button pulling, but since the fabric has stretch and the top has a generous cut, it wouldn?t look insane. my only issue is the fabric pills. i wore the top once, and the fabric near the armpit pilled a lot, especially for"
1," The light red color is really nice. i ordered an xs but usually order small, because of the cut and it was perfect. the fabric is heavy but loose. the collar stands up nicely and the buttons lay flat. i purchased this beautiful piece on sale, but i would have paid full price."
1,"So great Have been on the hunt for decent shorts all summer. as an elder, i need some length, comfort, style and attractive fit. these meet all the criteria. i'm 5'3"" and got the 31's. they're lightweight but substantial enough to keep their shape. love the faux cuff too. they stretched a bit but still have a perfect fit. got the grey on sale and getting 2 more in other colors left in my size at full price. so good!"
1, Beautiful dress. the details are lovely. it feels a little bit like a nightgown. i always wear a slip. bust does run a little small so i unbutton the first few buttons. armholes feel a little small also.
1,"Runs large I was excited to receive this tunic in the red (more of a rose color) yet so disappointed to find out how large it runs. my usual size with retailer is a small (sometimes, xs). after reading through the reviews, i ordered an xs and even the xs is too big -- just too much fabric. unfortunately, the xxs is sold out and the xs will be returned."
1,"Great summer shirt I can tell this is will be a ""go to"" shirt this summer. simple lines, yet a little ""different"" style - soft stripes, slits on the side seams and short, but not too short that it bares the stomach. it will look great with jeans, dressier with slim white pants or skirt or a pair of nice shorts. i don't usually go for button-down shirts, but this one was a bit unusual and caught my eye immediately. the fabric is soft yet holds it's shape."
1,"Runs very large I love tunics and really wanted this to work. i got this in a size s and it is absolutely gigantic. everything else about it is great, and i still haven't decided if i will try to swap it for an xs, which is definitely not my usual size (which is usually m, but often s at retailer). the pink/red color was quite pretty. if you have broad hips, fear not - you can size down and this top will still be generous around your hips. basically, if you're deliberating between s and m for this top, get"
1,"Effortless! I tried this on a whim during the sale with no real intentions of buying but the moment i put this on i feel in love! the denim is soooooooo soft. it is heaven! seriously one of the most comfortable pieces i have ever tried on. the fit is very flattering and it can be worn multi seasons so..... it went home! that night i put it on and walked doen the stairs and my two year old daughter said ""mommy is so pretty""! . score! this dress is so simple and can be styled so many ways. plus it seems very"
1,Super comfortable but not frumpy These have become my go-to shorts as i can dress them up or down
1,"Great shirt Love this shirt, the material the design... but....i have not worn it yet... the side openings are strategically placed to show my least flattening angles, if you know what i mean. i will be sewing these two openings and hope the shirt still looks and fits beautiful."
0, Legs are too wide. the fabric is rough to the touch.
1, True to size and love the color. great to wear dressed up with wedges and a blouse or dressed down with some mephistos and a tee. linen fabric makes them light for summer heat
1,"Fab versitile top Love! love! love! this top! i saw this online and immediately knew tha tthis had to be in my wardrobe. i wear a lot of navy....(in my estimating the classiest color there is...black is passe'). it is simple, very wearable with pants, with skirts. the very thin stripe adds interest, without really being a pattern that conflicts with other patterns. i did have an issue with some threads that were randomly hanging from sleeve cuff...but nothing important. yes, it is cropped...very much so!!! so, if"
1,"Cute holiday dress I'm 5'9 and wear a size 12. this dress runs tts though there is no stretch to it, found the bust to be a tad tight (38c). it is light with good movement. i did not find it short waisted and i thought the proportions were correct. the length was just long enough to make me feel comfortable wearing it. i'm looking forward to wearing it to holiday dinners this season."
1,Runs very large This is a super cute tunic - it is simply way too big.
1,"Great design These are so cute and the colors are great, however, they stretch out about 2 sizes. they fit me perfectly and i sized down and they stretched out about a size 1/2 to 2 sizes too big. i'm bummed out because they are perfect in every other way. didn't think they would stretch out as much as they did. and they look awful once
they've stretched out. wish i didn't take the tags off or i would have returned them. size down at
least one size, i could have sized down two sizes. hoping they shrink lik"
1,"Rules apply This dress is breathtaking in person: the back tie, the lace on the sides, the hem, the sleeves, the pleats at the chest, and the liner is opaque so it's not see-through. but it's very white, baby doll cut, and very short. in order to avoid the maternity, wedding-ish look, a few rules must be applied (thanks to retailer stylist ): buttons all the way up, a belt is a must to break the monotony of the all-over white and lace look. i purchased size 2 regular, and it still falls about 3 inches above m"
1,"Elegant casual This is an understated elegant denim dress. the fabric color is just the right fade and thickness (not too thin and not too thick) which is appropriate for most occasions. it?s very soft and can get a bit wrinkly but nothing major. my local retailer has only the regular size and it's true to size, size 6 (my usual size for holding horses brand) fit well around the bust and waist area (i?m 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips; busty gals may want to size up). this dress shows cleavage so if you?re conscious like"
1," This shirt is really cute. it's shorter than most - and it's supposed to be that way. if you don't want your midriff showing if you stretch - this shirt isn't for you. it has slits on the side also. the material is super light so will be great for summer. i just loved the way it fit and that it's different. i ordered an xs and i'm about 5'5"" and 120 lbs."
1,Super comfy shorts Love these shorts - got 2 pairs on sale just because it's hard to find shorts that fit nicely and are comfy with a great length.
1,"Great coverage This bathing suit has everything. i especially love the ruching in the waist and the boy short bottom. finally the coverage my booty needs. i've worn it dozens of times and it still holds its quality and looks brand new. i get a lot of compliments every time i wear it.
the only drawback is it doesn't dry very quickly. after a dip in the pool or the lake it stays wet for hours even when i'm laying out in the summer heat."
1,Love! I tried these on in my local store and immediately loved them! they are so flattering on my hourglass shape. the flare leg balances out the hips. great quality and very comfortable. i know i will get so much wear out of these. i bought a size up from my usual size and they fit perfectly.
1,"Beautiful skirt I love this skirt. the material is soft and beautiful. i love wearing it with black tights and boots. the skirt is quite a bit longer than how it appears on the model, however (unless the model is 10 ft tall!). i am 5'2"" and if i place the skirt under my ribs, it reaches right above my knee. it works though and doesn't look bad. i would still recommend you buy this!"
0,"Cute suit-didn't work for me This suit was high quality, and a cute design. however, it is clearly made for a lean body type."
1,Stripes of summer This was an unexpected surprise. i love the material of this short sleeved (almost sweatshirt) summer tee. the entire design reads late summer stripes with a cozy twist! the first time i wore it made me realize how tricky it can be to wear stripes and this design deconstructs all my previous hangups!
1,So cozy I love this!! great quality and super cozy. perfect to throw on for casual summer nights.
1,Very unique This is a great quality product with unique design
0,"Very thin material, not flattering I was very excited about ordering this top as i'm tall girl (6 ft) and i like my back well covered. i liked both style and design of the top on photo but when the package arrived i was very disappointed with the material. this top is incredibly thin and see through. though fabric is nice and soft, it feels more like a pajama top. all curves & bumps immediately stand out and it doesn't look flattering. i ordered 2 colors grey and black size large and returned both, although they were true to size"
1,Retro style I bought a size 8 a few years back not my regular size but when used it tend to sag. so this time i bought a size 6 my regular size.
1,"Great versatile top This is definitely my go to top for work, weekends or night out with the husband. i've worn it with skinny jeans, black tights and skirts. it goes with just about anything. easy to accessorize with a simple long chain necklace or a statement piece. i think the gray combo was a bit more flattering than the green combo."
1,"Beautiful and flattering I love the colors on this dress, very nice on a pale skin. i ahd this in my wish list for so long, and it finally went on sale. i ordered it and was very pleased. only drawback is the collar was a little irritating (but i am ok with it). it fits like a glove (o), i didn't think it would as there are no petites, but that worked for me, the lace pattern is classy. and the hem is totally fun. great purchase (maybe petite would not have bothered my neck).
115 lbs, 30 dd, 26.5 in waist"
1, Cute tunic.  fits on the fitted side but i love it with a vest layered over. nice material.
1,"For the price...just ok Note: if you have a large chest, the seams hit in an unflattering spot. nice shirt, just not great for the price."
1, I agree with other reviews.  this is perfect to throw on for running errands or just hanging out at home.  super soft and comfy.  got the blue and now want the grey.
1,"Super compfy This top is my go-to running errands top on the weekends, its super comfy and not to warm to wear throughout all the seasons. runs true to size and i get a bunch of compliments on the quality!"
1,"Love this tee! This long sleeved tee is soft and beautiful. the swing design is so pretty and flattering. the seams along the front and back are a lovely addition. i also appreciate the higher neckline, which is increasingly hard to find in these kind of tees. would love it in more colors. i bought the black. i tried the white as well, but it was too transparent for this particular style and the tank top underneath gave it a sporty appearance. not horrible, but not what i wanted, so the white went back."
0,"Alas not as good as it looks The suit is lovely, but it is very long in the torso and gaps at the leg. i was told that it runs small and to size up to a 10. i did, but i do not think the smaller one would have done better. the bust is fake and it turns out when untied. worst of all it emphasizes the tummy. all in all not a good look for me. i am not heavy but i do need tummy support. normally i wear an 8 and in garnet hill a 6. sorry but it went back. i really wanted to like it."
1,"Pretty details The delicate detail at the neckline on this sweater adds such a pretty yet subtle touch.
i layer it with various camis for a different look each time.
i ordered the dark yellow and it is a very unique and rich shade, and goes well with so other many colors.
looks gorgeous with a mint or aqua cami for a peek a boo effect.
classic yet unique!
runs very true to size."
1,"Fun cropped pants, but size uo I bought one size up in these fun cropped pants. i am petite but wanted these to fit longer, so i ordered a regular size. they are perfect. there is a nice patterned texture to these pants that is hard to see in the pictures. they are worth the price!"
1,"Cute! Love this shirt. i have it in black.  i have a larger chest, but i don't feel like the seams hit me wrong.  this is super cute and swingy.  i however think the price is way too high for a think cotton tee."
1,"Almost perfect I'm 5.1 and always bought 27p. they didn't have petite anymore, so i bought 27r, knowing that it'll hit my ankle instead of being cropped. it's very cute as an ankle-length with some flare. my only issue is that the 27r was very tight around the crotch and upper thigh. it's a very tight fit just right there!... and not enough of stretch to be comfortable when sitting. i wonder if it will stretch out a bit more from wear? i then ordered a 28r to see if that fits better, and it fits a tad loose ev"
1,"Love! This chambray is super soft! it has such a great feel and texture. i love the detail and design on the front. it adds just the right amount of interest without making the top feel busy and still very neutral in color so you can dress it many different ways. i'm not sure how this fits in comparison to other holding horses shirts/tops, but i had to size up one from my typical retailer size because of the my (which isn't large!). so excited to get a lot of use out of this!"
1,"These cords are great! These cords are beautiful in the wine color and fit very well! i am 5'1 and got the petite size and felt they were a little to short, i know they are cropped flare but they hit me at a weird place. hindsight, i probable should have ordered then one size up!"
1,"Absolutely stunning--if you get the right size This is the most intricate, delicate, beautiful dress i have seen in a long time! the pale blue, coppery brown, and dark purple tones are so complimentary of fair skin, dark hair, and light eyes. unfortunately my normal size was far too snug, especially on my hips, and this is now sold out. the fabric has no give, so i would say with any curves, size up if you can find this beauty. i'm heartbroken to be returning it!"
1,Classy shirt Very comfortable shirt.  washes up nicely with just a little ironing on the pleats.  cute detail of colored thread on buttons.  just a tad tight in the shoulders but not distracting.  no button placket chest gapping.
0,"Not what i expected... Based on other customer reviews, i ordered these trousers expecting a lightweight cropped pant that would be appropriate for spring and especially summer. however, the fabric is much heavier than what i'd usually wear in the summer . the cut of the trousers were superb though - i like a low-rise or hipster cut which these are.

they are fitted and not oversized like many of the other retailer items i buy, so if you are an xs these will be xs (or runs small for retailer clothing) if you like your clo"
1,"Great versatile tunic I bought this tunic over christmastime at full price. i absolutely adore it! in my opinion, it isn't too thick or too thin. i got my usual size large and i think it fits perfectly! there are side slits, so it's perfect with skinny jeans or leggings. it's flattering because of the vertical stripes in the fabric. also with the grey color, there is a difference in the two fabrics that are used in the construction, so this adds some additional visual appeal. i haven't had any problems with snagging"
1,"Love this tunic! I am in love with this tunic, i wear it with everything, jeans, leggings and just tights! super comfy, quality design. runs a bit large but i like that."
1,Top that works with lots of colors Comfortable and cute. versatile colors that can be worn with virtually anything.
1,Fun I get a ton of compliments on this. cute and comfortable. you can't go wrong.
0,"Huge, long, lightweight Not a pretty blouse - it's quite utilitarian in design - and it runs enormous."
0,"Mumsy It's thin knit with a unique and pretty neckline, but unfortunately it's scratchy will not last. i just received it and it looks like it would fall apart after a few wears. it's a nice shade of offwhite at least. for me it's a no that will get sent back straight away."
0,"Very thin fabric, pretty disappointing I was so excited to order this top - it looked like it was made of more sturdy, soft cotton, but sadly after receiving it today i found that to not be true. it's incredibly sheer - you'd have to wear a cami underneath, which defeated the point for me. the pleating in the front hides your bra, but you can see it from all other angles (i tried it on with an unlined nude lace bra, which can easily hide under sheer clothing). i was hoping to be able to wear it on its own without a cami and for it to"
1,"Gorgeous jacket This is a lovely jacket. it is easily paired with different bottoms and tops, and is such a fun take on the standard blazer with the beautiful ruffle pocket-detail. they are not actual pockets though, which i thought would have been an easy thing to incorporate. my chief issue with the fit is that it is a tad boxy. i am a standard xs/xxs and this runs just a tad big and a bit wide. but unbuttoned it falls seamlessly. if you use the clasp, it actually looks bigger. regardless, i love it and was o"
1, This is a beautiful jacket. the fabric is soft and drapes wonderful. truly a great addition to any staple in your wardrobe. i am having the sleeves shortened as i prefer a more 3/4 length.
1,"Love this suit! I am 5'5, 150lb, generally size medium shirt, size 6 or 8 pants and bought a size 8. i have had two c-sections so my stomach has some problem areas, which can be easily highlighted in a swimsuit- not this one! i felt good, it hid my problem spots, showed off curves and stays in place! i can't speak to the durability of it yet, however, it makes me feel great, and that is tough when i am in a bathing suit. that in itself makes it worth the price! try it!"
1,"Love the cropped flare I bought these pants in the wine color and i love them! i found them to be true to size. i always wear a 27 in pilcro and these were no exception. i am finding the cropped flare silhouette to be so versatile. they are more ankle length than cropped on me as i am 5'3"" but i think i prefer this. these pants can easily be dressed up or down - have worn with a dressy top and heels as well as a denim shirt and ballet flats. super cute!"
1,"Beautiful dress Fell in love with this dress when i saw it. beautiful design and flow. although it needs an underskirt, because it is a see through. also it is a bit tight on the chest section. i haven't wore it yet, so more to come.."
1,"Great bouse I really like this blouse. it's hard to find a short sleeved button down that the sleeves don't stick out and look weird. this one does not have this problem. it is a bit sheer, but i don't mind wearing a cami with it. it is flowy... but not boxy/baggie. has a very nice, flattering drape. i'm 5'3"", 110lbs., 32c, petite frame. the 00 regular fits great. i'm often a petite (especially in pants and long sleeved tops)... but went with the regular size here bc i wanted the longer length."
1,Simple t with a twist I love this shirt! it's a nice simple long-sleeved tee with some nice details. i especially love the seaming on the front & back-- very flattering!
1,"They feel amazing! These feel so soft and amazing. i especially love that the length work for me, just a tiny bit long and i am 5'4. i did find that they ran smaller than my pilcro and other jeans."
0,"Not what i expected I bought this suit based on the great reviews. i was so bummed when i tried it on. the top fit so well but the bottom kept bunching up. my torso is on the longer side so maybe that's why the bottoms keep coming up. every time i pulled the shorts down, the top would come down too, and vice versa. i am 5'5 and 120lbs and bought a 2 which is my normal size. i did like that the top had a bit of padding but that's the extent of what i liked about it. i will be returning it."
1,"Super cute - but they do run small I thought i'd be the exception - these pants are super cute - great fabric and color - kind of loved them - but they do run small - by about one size. just something to keep in mind while ordering. other than that - they are lovely, well-made pants."
1,"Such a nice bathing suit! This is my first one piece bathing suit, and i absolutely love it. the quality is great ! the color doesn't fade.
i usually wear a size 4 but i ordered a size 6 and it fits perfectly."
1, I loved this top so much i bought both colors! soft and warm without being too thick or bulky.
1,"Great colors, runs small Love the wine colored cords-- but i tried them and i was disappointed because my normal size was too small. i usually have to size down in pilcro pants but not these. (i'm an 8, and the 30 wasn't going to button!) i love the slight cropped flare! and the color! did i mention the color? but vanity wouldn't allow me to buy them. hopefully i just got a mislabeled pair!"
1,"Wonderful supima cotton top! This is a terrific top!  the supima cotton is super-soft; the black, a deep black.  i love that antho is listening, and that it's made in the usa!  the lines and flow are beautiful and flattering.  i bought the medium and am a reliable size 8 top/medium, 34f.  the sleeves are nice and long.  don't miss out on this classic tee, friends!"
1,Score! Great dress that is very flattering. works well with flats or can be dressed up with heels. perfect for travel because the material doesn't wrinkle. would highly recommend this dress!
1,"Great pants These cords are great--lightweight for fl winters, and the bootcut flare bottom is super cute with ballet flats or booties. i am 5'10"" and typically a size 8; the size 29 fit perfectly. they have a little stretch to them, which is great. very flattering--wish i could order in more colors!!"
1,"Nice drape, lovely navy I've been looking for a navy shirt for some time and this is it. it's soft, drapes nicely but it's not as dressy as silk shirt would be. the navy is really blue, not a black-navy like so many. i've washed and dried it in the machines and it came out well. shrank just a little, but that made it perfect. for me it was true to size because i liked the slightly over-sized boyfriend fit, yet it still has shape. if you want a fitted shirt, go down a size or look for something else."
0,"Beautiful color, nice fabric but .. When i read all these positive reviews i did not hesitated, as i wanted good basics which will be good investment in me as looking good is always investment. well, i love blue color as i am blonde wih blue eyes and this color makes my eyes brighter and matches almost everything but..the design of the shirt is made oversize fit basically the shirt should not be dressed as fitted it's more relaxed fit so if you wear medium go head and order medium even if the small fits unless you want to look lik"
1,Soft and comfortable while dressing up or down The weight and drape of this shirt is wonderful. it is very comfortable while still being flattering. you could wear it with jeans and sneakers or heels. fits true to size and the navy color is very deep.
1,"Unique I love this top! i just bought it on sale so the price was great but it would have been totally worth it paying full price! great quality, unique, and great fit. i look forward to wearing it all year!"
1,"Love it I absolutely love this dress! beautiful prints and design. i would say to size down though as it is rather flowy. i am normally a small and went to an xs, and it fits much better. this is definitely a keeper!"
1,"Alpinia top I really love the top but fyi it's really an open front vest and the under tank doesn't come with it. it's nice because you can mix it up with different colors underneath, but i think they should have noted that fact in case you weren't prepared to receive half of what you thought you were purchasing."
1,"Loved this but too short for me I wish this dress was just a bit longer, it was beautifully made and i loved the colors, just too short for me."
1,"Perfect fit This top is exactly what i was looking for. rich olive color and very versatile. great as a lightweight jacket, casual or dressed up button up. i purchased a medium and it fits great. 5'7"", broad shoulders, narrow waist, and full hips."
0, Runs large. very boxy. white fabric on lower portion of the shirt extremely thin. it did not look as good as in in picture. very disappointing!
1,So pretty but too big Just got this dress in an xl. i've never ordered from retailer before so i expected their clothes to run small. i was wrong. it's a beautiful high quality dress but i think it's just too big. i may end up exchanging it for a l. definitely size down in this dress!
1,"Perfect dress I love this dress so much - comfortable, flattering and really pretty. i wish i could buy this dress in every color!"
1,"Great staple shirt I love this shirt - it is very soft, and has a nice cut and drape. fits true to size. wish there were more colors!"
1,"So soft Love these level 99 pants. ""newport"" style. dress them up or down. wearing mine today with a moth top i also got at a. looking kind of 70s chic. light jeans for a hot day."
1,"Great staple piece! I almost passed this in the store, but i am glad that i tried it! i really like that the fabric is so soft and has a ""blouse"" feel... and is machine washable! yay! love nice blouses that don't need to be dry cleaned! i would describe the material as thicker, so some may not like this for warmer weather. looks great with a long necklace like the minuet! i am typically a small and purchased this in an extra-small and still have plenty of room."
1,"Simply amazing In love! just wow. beautiful colors although they're dark you can still see all the variations. the flannel is light and not too heavy. there's visible black lace just below the shoulder. pretty buttons. ordered the large, my normal size and it's a perfect fit. roomy but not oversized. so well made i think this will be a favorite for years."
1,"So soft and cuddly! I am 5'5"" normally about 120lb, but i'm about 145lb now at 9 months prego. i purchased the small. i can't resist buying retailer clothes, even though they might not fit me currently! however, because this shirt is drapey, it actually fits over my baby bump now and it will be perfect as a nursing shirt and then regular shirt later. it is so soft and great quality. will be cute dressed up for work or down with jeans!"
1,"Amazing I'm only 5'3"" so i ordered a small but i have a larger rear (size 4-6) end and bust (32dd). the small gave me plenty of room in the top. the bottom area was definitely meant for someone with a smaller butt but i don't feel over exposed or anything. the fabric on the bottom is thick which is really nice. it makes the body seem slim and keeps the white from being see through even when wet. the long sleeve design is also awesome! i have gotten numerous compliments on it. the top has an inner liner"
1,"Excellent I am 5'3"", 28/38 and got the sp. had no issues whatsoever, and love the colors."
1," I love this dress. like another reviewer said, it's the perfect teacher dress. i wore it on the first day of school. it's comfortable and flattering and super cute. i received lots of compliments."
1,"Swingy and light Swing dresses are the holy grail of comfort. whatever's going on underneath doesn't matter because you're all arms and legs and billowy fun and this dress doesn't disappoint. beautiful, light and silky fabric with a pattern and color palate that can easily work all spring, summer and into the fall with some layers. a great, unique dress!"
1,"Swing into spring! This is an adorably gorgeous swing dress. the fabric is soft and flowy, and everything a swing dress should be. i was concerned that it would be too short, but it's the perfect length-fun while still being classy. a nice, chunky, eccentric bib necklace and nude sandal wedges would complete this outfit beautifully. highly recommend!"
0,"Beautiful dress, badly designed top! I love the fabric and pattern of this dress so much that i decided to keep it (got it on mega sale), but i would have never paid full price or anything close. the armholes are enormous, showing bra and all. i am not particularly large chested (34c), and the buttons are stretched to gaping on me, even with the huge armholes. i have a cute red sweater coat that i will wear over it all fall, but i could not recommend it because of the poor cut design.

pros: great pattern, fabric, pockets, true to"
1, Got lots of complements on this one. worn to work with skinny pants and a chunky necklace. classic look with a twist. would also look adorable with jeans as shown.
0,"Small in bust I am a 36dd, 10/12 in tops and 12/14 in bottoms.

i tried both the navy/red pattern and the green polka dot. color and patterns on both are gorgeous. the fabric is very comfortable and a nice fit on the bottom half. size large fit perfectly in the waist however i had gapping across the bust. size xlarge fit ok in the front of the bust, but was loose in the back, gapping at the neck, and the waist was very loose. cute and comfy but only recommended for smaller busted gals."
1, I ordered this in sand and loved it so much when i received it that i went back and ordered it in black as well. it is very flattering and sexy!
0,Flawed The cut of the top portion of the dress is off. i tried on the s in-store & it bunched up in the breast area. i ordered a sp hoping the petite would fix the problem - nope - still bunched up. for reference i am a 34b. i would have kept the dress and given 5 stars if it wasn't for said flaw.
1,"Super cute I, sadly, only noticed this top once on sale. i tried on the xs and it was just a bit big, i would need the petite, so i had to leave it behind (115 lbs, 30dd) - but it is adorable, can be dressed up and classy, casually with jeans, or sweetly, so many ways... love the subtle polka dots... oh well, i am sure i will find something similar i love!"
1,Cream colored The top is more of a cream color than an ivory. it's also a bit boxer than anticipated. fit is true to size.
1,"This was the retailer steal of a lifetime. I grabbed this dress in green when i saw it on sale (plus there was an additional percentage off that day online) and they had my size. while it's slightly loose in the body of the dress, that will probably tighten up after the first wash since it's rayon - then it should fit like a glove. i didn't experience the zipper issue - there is a hook & eye at the top to keep the fabric together, and the zipper was stiff so it won't unzip of its own volition. it is a tad bulky at the top of the zipper w"
1,"Classic I recently purchased this tunic and love it! its not to big, hangs just right, arm holes are not to big and the material is very comfortable! looks great with white jeans, shorts, or just jeans. i will get a lot of wear all year round! fits true to size. oh, slimming too!"
1,"Exactly what i was looking for I had been searching for an almost 50s style dress and i saw this one and instantly loved it. i wind up sending back so many things i get through retailer but this dress was everything i hoped it would be. i got the green one with the white dots. very comfortable, it just out a little with the hips because of the cut which is very 50s styling--it makes the waist look more narrow..."
0,"Pretty but not as pictured I was expecting an ivory/white cardigan with some lace along the sides with a more slim fit. i am 138 lbs, 36b and normally wear a s or m so i ordered a m. the sweater is at least 1 or 2 sizes too large in my opinion and not at all a slim fit but more of boxy fit.

the lace edges need to be trimmed up due to raw edges and strings hanging from them. also the color is difficult to detect online but i was surprised to see that it is ivory with gray stripes. not unpleasant but not as pictured. as"
0,"As others have said... This is a very fetching little dress but the details of the fit, as described by other reviewers, is slightly off. i am 34d 5'5 and 140 lbs. the top fits perfectly but has an odd gap at the button placket. the fabric is nice enough but not exactly as i expected. one must have a very flat stomach as the top of the dress is not forgiving at all. the dress just wasn't me, i guess, so this one is going home to retailer..."
0," This top is quite boxy and i was very disappointed with the color, it looked as if i'd washed it in filthy water. it's a very dingy white, needless to say it went back."
1,"Cute shirt with unique pattern I love finding cute tops on sale that have great potential, but just need a little altering. i bought this one in my usual size medium and took it in 2 inches on both sides. it's still a looser fit, but much cuter. i didn't want to size down fearing it would be too tight in the shoulders and underarms. it's also a softer cotton fabric (similar to brushed cotton) rather than the crisp cotton most white button down shirts are made of."
1,"Belia peplum top I really wanted this top to work but i felt that it was big and boxy. it's shorter in the front and longer in the back. the seam and peplum hit at a strange place and made me look disheveled. it's definitely worth trying on, but didn't fit me."
1,"Love the 3/4 sleeves This is all around, a pretty feminine take on the white shirt- very cute! the dot pattern adds some drama without it being too over-board. this fit of this top is fairly generous (on me at least), but it doesn't have a lot of stretch. i could probably be either a s or xs, but took the xs to get more of a silhouette."
1,"Comfortable, colorful, stylish! This is a great dress! it's comfortable, easy care, and it looks fantastic. i love the bright green color, it's easy to wear alone, casually, or dressed up with cardigans or jackets. for my climate, this is a year-round piece. i can tone down the color and layer for cool seasons, and wear it alone in warm seasons."
1,Lovely This is a great dress; good quality fabric. the pattern & color are spot on. the silhouette is divine & would work on many body types. i also love the length!
1,"Cute top Cute top, wish they had xxs. looks great with jeans and a fun necklace like pix. i got an xs (5'4 and 135 lbs) and it's still a little wider than i would prefer, but i'm not a skinny jeans gal so might look better with those. i decided to keep it since no xxs. wore all day with jeans for a more casual event, then added a skirt and high heels later for a theater show. super comfortable and looks great for all occasions."
0,"Unflattering I really love the pattern and the look on the model, and i thought i would love it. i ordered online, so i did not try on in store. when i tried it on, it has way too much fabric around the waist and skirt. it is thick fabric as well, and has a lining, and the waist has extra fabric for the design, and it has pockets, so it all adds up to be way too bulky. it is not flattering at all and made me look 10 pounds heavier. i am returning this dress. sad, because it looks so lovely on the model. i am"
0," This tunic looks awesome in the picture. however, it is made of an uncomfortable sweater-like material not left of centers normal skin cotton. i was disappointed once i saw this in person. not a great material for summer."
0,"Cute design, good quality but baggy & unflattering Like a previous reviewer, i love white blouses -- nothing better. also love polka dots, so i grabbed this at my retailer store the minute i saw it without even trying it on. quality is good; nice material. maybe a little heavy for summer. but it really didn't work on me. i normally wear a small in tops, however with a 34d chest (5'5"" 122 lbs) i do sometimes get a bit of gapping with blouses at the chest. this does not gap but it just hangs on me. if it was a true peplum and fitted at the waist i t"
0,"Completely wonky I got this in a l, and probably i am a m. however, the waist pretty much fit, but the bodice was baggy in a really bizarre way. i don't think a human could actually be shaped a way that would fit properly in this dress. this dress is well suited for a woman with a very large bust, but a small waist."
1,Flowy and feminine This is my favorite top! i'm a 36d and usually wear a medium or large. i love this paired with skinny jeans or my level 99 blue shorts.
1,"The key to cute fit is to size down I can see why the other reviewers think this top is huge in the waste - it's wide and not tailored at the waste ! the key to super cute fit is to size down - then it will look like it does on the model in the picture. i went with my regular medium and felt like i was wearing a giant moomoo, so i sized down and it immediately looked like it does on the model in the picture. it's super adorable in person, the collar and the polka dots make this playful yet very dressy and feminine and appropriate"
1,"Polyester lining? no. I have been in love with white lace tops lately. i saw in the description that there was a ""polyester lining"" - i'm really not into wearing a cami all the time as it takes away from the lace (my personal opinion). so i'm a little disappointed there there is no lining. very pretty. styling is a bit more ""swing""."
1,"Cute, great quality, nice fit Love this top so much. it's very unique and one of those tops that's ""effortless"" to wear. i was expecting it to be boxy because of what other reviewers had written, but i find it to be flattering and comfortable. i'm glad i ordered the small because i do think the medium (my usual size) would have been too big."
1,"Classic work appropriate dress I am 5'4, 34c, with a pear shape. this dress fit me perfectly in a medium (30 inch natural waist). i had to use a safety pin to keep the bosom from gaping too much, so a smaller chested person would likely not have any issues. however, the material and design were perfectly pinup and work appropriate, so i was willing to make adjustments for it."
1,Beautiful Beautiful nightie- looks like its really well made and fits really well. i'm normally a size 6-8 and the m was perfect. definitely recommend.
0,"Too boxy I really liked this top but when i tried it on it was big and too boxy. i considered ordering it in petite but the sales person said that the cut would be the same, boxy but shorter so i decided to pass."
1,"Gorgeous! This fit perfectly. i am 5'7 , 138 pounds and ordered a small. i was very pleased with the way it draped over my body. i bought the black one."
1,"From a white shirt collector! I love white shirts and can never have enough in my closet. this one is gorgeous, and is way prettier in person than it looks on the model. it has a peplum bottom with sort of (but not quite)appliqu茫漏d large polka dots all over. it is a pullover, so there are no buttons on the peplum. i normally wear xl in retailer tops unless they run very large. i tried on the large in the store and it fit but i knew if it shrank when i washed it i'd never be able to wear it again. i ordered the xl which came tod"
0,"So close What a beautiful dress! after reading all the other reviews i ordered a size small petite. way too big. the dress sagged down so the waist was at my hips. there was a good 4 inches that i could've taken in. in addition the arm holes showed my entire side of my bra. even if i sized down to an xsp my bra would be visible. such a pity because i loved the blue motif.

no issues with the zipper as others have mentioned

for reference i'm 5'2"" 107 lbs average proportions."
1, It is so beautiful and just as shown in the pictures! very elegant! i normally wear a small and it hung off me just a little.
0,"Returned Wanted to love this- i did love the color and thought the style would work for anyone. but i tried it on and immediately took it off with a definite ""not keeping this."" the side zipper- a complaint by many, really made it uncomfortable. also, the detail under the bust would not lay flat and just looked odd. loved the material and definitely the green print. but i knew i would never wear it. just looked blah."
1,"Cute, alittle boxy I was so excited for another fun white shirt. this was fits the bill! its cute, it does run alittle boxy maybe a hair large. it is also not white, white, has a touch of ivory. still, is a great top with skinny jeans. received a compliment yesterday while getting coffee, the lady was going online to get one for herself!"
1,Cute but can add love handles I'm usually a small but the skirt of the dress was a bit loose and added love handles to my figure when i wear it. a smaller size would work better. it's cute and i love it but the material is form fitting and do a larger size isn't flattering. an xsmall for me
1," I have this top in the blue print and i love it. i'm super tempted to buy it in the black as well since i love it so much, but it might be a little pricy to have two of the same top. the only thing i will warn women about this top is that if you are busty then i would recommend going up a size. i wear a small in most retailer clothes but i went for a medium in this top. while the small did fit in al other areas, it looked like the buttons were going to pop at my bust."
0,"Not my thing... This shirt was just really missing something for me. i originally liked the patter of the small dots all over the fabric, especially with the sleeves being more sheer than the rest of the blouse. i also am tending to gravitate toward clothes that hide my residual baby fat in my midsection. however, the tie is very high up on the neck and it made me feel like i was wearing a turtleneck. i rarely wear turtle necks because they make me feel like i am choking. in addition, the bow seemed to be too t"
0,"So-so I had been eyeing this top for a while so i was so happy to see it go on sale! i was so excited that i went to my local retailer to try to purchase it right away. unfortunately this top did not fit me right. on the model it looks adorable, on me it was frumpy & ugly. the petite is sold out so i tried a regular medium (i'm usually in-between a medium & a large) & it fit me big & just didn't do anything to my figure. i agree with the other reviewers that the bow was too thin & flimsy & needed to be"
1,"Great find! This top is adorable on. the online picture doesn't do it justice. a sales girl in my store had it on and i loved it and had to try it on. i got it in xs - black. i am 5'2"" and 115 lbs. it has the perfect drape to it. it might be too cool for winter but will be perfect when it warms up a little. this was my favorite thing i found in the store in months. love it."
1," I took advantage of the promotional discount offered on this coat. i admired this soon as it appeared.  hesitant to purchase without any reviews, nor had opportunity to visit the store so i took a chance.  i love the pattern, burgundy wine faux fur collar, the fit. colors are true. i sized up which i recommend. glad i did, this will require thick sweater to provide any type of warmth if you are in a colder climate.  length mid-knee. imo not worth full price.  eleveness does design pretty coats!"
1,"Perfect blouse Fun , flirty, feminine!! love this blouse with jeans or with a skirt or leggings! i bought both blues i liked the first and after wearing it i ordered the navy with dots along with santuary black legging pants... just love !!!highly recommend. easy to wear."
1,"Sweet I saw this in the rockefeller store and picked it right up. i don't wear red so this shade or burgundy was more my color. the fit is perfect (sometimes buy a m at retailer but the small was perfect, which is what i'd wear at in most brands). i was slightly shocked it cost more than the other tops i bought, but it was too pretty to put back. wore with dark flare jeans to dinner that very night!"
1,"Perfect spring jacket! I love the style of this jacket! 
i will be curious to see how it holds up in the rain.
it's very well made and has cute details.
it does run large."
0,"Cute but baggy! I really wanted to love this romper and couldn't wait to try it on.   it's super cute and love the material but once on the top portion is way too baggy even after cinching the waist.   if i pulled the waist all the way down it looks smoother and nice,  but if it sits at my natural waist,  the back balloons out and it's unflattering.  it's too bad,  i love the print and ease of this design."
1," This dress would have been perfect in a medium petite. beautiful dress, wish i had sized down"
0,"It's okay Ahhh, i should have listened to previous reviews. indeed, this top runs very large. style wise, it is ok. i would say you could do much better at retailer."
1,"Little black winter dress I found this dress to be perfect for the winter season. its warm, sleek, and classy. this dress is made in the usa so it is worth the price. i love the opening on the back and find it be flattering. it can be worn with tights for the winter and easily worn without in the summer. a wise investment for my closet!"
1,Cute and comfy Very cute and true to size if not just a little large up top.
1,Beautiful shirt Fits true to size. very feminine. it's great with skinny jeans. not quite the length of tunic
1,"Best romper! I love this romper so much! i'm a tall girl (5'9), so often times its hard for me to find a romper that isn't too short. the length on this is perfect. this romper is an adorable design and the fit is great. the material is a great quality, and its really comfortable! i'm 5'9 34b bra, i usually range between an xs and s, i went with the s on this one and it fits great! i definitely recommend this if you're thinking about it."
1,"So flattering! I love love love this top. i love it so much i bought it in two different colors so i can wear it more often. i think it's feminine, chic, and classic. i've worn it several times and i each time i've had more than one person comment on it. i normally wear a small but they only had it in an extra small and i actually like how it fits which is why i think it runs a little large. the only place that it is a bit small is the cuffs at the end of the sleeves. i usually just unbutton those anyway so no"
1,"Great for summer I just got this top and can't wait to wear it for spring/summer! it is a lovely lightweight material and hangs loosely and comfortably. it definitely runs quite large so i would at the very least consider ordering on the small side of what you normally wear if not sizing down one completely. this is coming from someone who usually likes tops on the roomier side, so trust me on this! overall, i highly recommend this top if you're looking for a muted but unique, comfy top for the warmer months ahe"
1,"Nice Darling top, lovely dark rich raspberry red color. runs very large so definitely size down. i ordered the s and m. i am usually m but went with the small. the s was smaller in the shoulders of course but not terribly- it was only an issue when i hugged myself. in the picture it looks like it fits her very well. i don't feel like it fits me quite as well- it's borderline maternity-ish... just a little too large and should come in at the waist just a touch more. i agree the bow i.e. seems weak (fa"
1,"Every color! I bought this in every color, and would probably keep buying it if there were others - the fit is loose yet flattering, quality is good, feminine pretty ruffles that don't add bulk, and i love that it makes me feel pretty and put-together post-baby."
1,"Totally adorable This romper is so cute and comfy! the fabric is soft and a beautiful shade of blue with light blue dots (true to the photos). i sometimes have issues with rompers due to my long torso, but this fits great, with shorts hitting about the same as the model image (i'm 5'7""). i really love the v-neck on this too - it's simple, but a really flattering cut that i don't think would expose even ladies with a larger chest. definitely a nice everyday piece - excited to wear it on a hot summer day at the pa"

fit: some of the other comments mention the small waist. this is a fitted sweater, not a roomy piece for layering over other pieces. i like the fit because i get the warmth of a big sweater without the bulk. the fit is similar to dresses that i have purchased at anth"
1, I absolutely love this top. i'm always either an x-small or 0/2 in mauve. i think this top runs small. i tried on an extra small and it was too tight in the chest. i'm average in bust.
0,Disappointed I'd been wanting the blouse for quite a while but hesitated based on reading reviews. when it went on sale i thought i'd try but it was like a tent on me. the fabric was pretty but just hung without any resemblance to photo. too bad because the color was gorgeous & could have been a favorite of looked like photo.
0," This blouse is a beautiful color and i love the dot design and texture. however, it is a much baggier fit than i expected based on the photo, and it looks a little bit like a maternity shirt on me. i usually wear a size 8 or 10 and i bought a size medium."
1,"Great shape This romper has a great shape! you know that long saggy grandma butt that some rompers give you....this one is not that! it's cute and adorable and those long stitched pockets are so flattering to us short folk! i'm 5'4"" on a good day, 125#, 32g and this fits great. i picked up an xs (i'm never an xs) and it was very flattering. i'm usually a 4/27 in pants for reference. the v-neck and the way the shoulder seams start to angle in at the top make this very flattering. it is long enough for me to"
1,Adorable Love this tunic. i bought it in black and wore it with skinny jeans and flat black boots and received many compliments. can be dressed up for work or worn with distressed jeans on the weekend.
1,"Cute enough, will it protect>? I have been needing a rain coat and saw this one on sale, so decided to try it on. i do wish it was more ""fitted"", but it is pretty cute. the embroidered detail is nice. too bad the xs petite is sold out. i have no idea if it will hold to the rain though..."
1,"Nice and feminine flowy top This top is not bmeant to be super fitted, it is flowy and ""romantic"". i have ordered the petite to decide which size to keep, but my usual xs was fine, wil ljsut compare length. i was also curious about hte smaller size, but didn't order it, so i wil lnever know.
the only color i saw in person is the black on, and it is calssic, so i went with it. shall wait for petite verdict!"
1,"Petite on this one (5 foot one and a half lol) So i tried on the regular size in the store, and love the top, but looked too big on me.

color is gorgeous and rich, the sheer adds a little whimsical to it, and i love the tie-neck trend of lately. would go nicely with jeans (skinny or flare) or trousers, not sure about a skirt though,."
1,"Great fit and flow Love this flowing, cute top! casual, but can be easily dressed up. great fit."
0, This sweater coat is very bulky and has an odd and unflattering shape when on.
1,Very nice jacket for petites I usually wear an xxsp in retailer brands. i bought this jacket in a regular size 0 and it fits like a glove. even the sleeves are the right length. it really accents my narrow waist. i imagine it runs very small for those who wear regular sizes. if you are petite this is the jacket for you. the jacket is unlined so i cant wear it in cold weather. it is very nice over a dress with black boots and with skinny jeans. i receive complements every time i wear this item!
0,"Way too short I'm 5'7"", 130 lbs. i ordered a medium-regular. the dress fell three inches above my knees. this model is taller than i am, and it falls to her knees....doesn't make sense. i think retailer sends petites in place of regular."
0,"Buy if you have no fat Although i am small (size xs on top, 27 waist) this dress is not flattering if have any fat on your body....i would not recommend it."
0,"Not for me I'm usually a petite, but bought in regular xs. perhaps a petite would have worked better, but this was way too low cut in front and back. i did not like the way it hung on me at all. i'm 5;2"" and 105 lbs, but regular xs normally fits better than this did. i could barely keep the shoulders from slipping off. sorry, it's a return for me."
1,"So comfortable, flattering & with a great print I ordered the navy in size xl and it fits me just as it does the model. this top is definitely one of my favorite retailer purchases. the cut is very flattering. i love how they designed the tunic to have a closer fit on top, the arms and through the top of the waist and then flow out. i'm a pear-shape and worried the bottom layer might accent my hips, but it all flows really nicely. the arms aren't tight. they're not loose but aren't too poofy.

the material washed well too, without static (a pro"
1,Cute but super small I really love this sweater. i normally wear an 8 and bought a 12. even it is a little snug. but it really is very cute! can't wait to wear it with black leggings and boots.
1," While this is gorgeous in person, if you have a larger bust the v-neck will look really weird. because its so deep, it gets skewed(i'm a d cup). if only the v were 1 or 2 inches higher! unfortunately it's going back."
1,"Cute blouse Bought it on sale and i am keeping it. it is well made an the material seems to be of good quality. however, i believe this would be more flattering on someone less curvy - less hips, smaller bust - as it makes me look slightly pregnant. still, i am keeping it to use on those days i just don't feel like dressing up for work. i bought a large (i'm a 36-38c), but i think i could've gotten away with a medium."
1, I like this raincoat but it runs large. exchanging for a smaller size.
1,"Pretty & comfy I bought this in blue/black. it is so pretty. i get so many compliments. i'm a size 4/6 but large busted. i bought this in a medium & it's perfect. just the right amount of fullness. i'm 5'4"" so the length for me is perfect w/leggings."
1,"Please get this top! I purchased this amazing tunic in-store in the plaid pattern, and couldn't be more thrilled with it. i can already see myself overwearing it, because it's so pretty and easy. i typically wear an xs, and sometimes petite styles. the regular small fits very well. i'm sure the xs would have been alright, but i like the way my forearms don't feel constricted where it buttons, and sizing up seemed to help with gaping by the button holes. i love the way this looks with a variety bottoms and shoes. it"
1,"Beautiful construction This garment is beautiful because the fabric has great drape to it. i am probably between a small and xsmall, but ordered the xsmall. it is snug, but i have decided to keep it and can wear a cami underneath, just in case the buttons gap just a little. i am concerned that going up a size with leave the neck area too gaping. it is also a little snug in the elbow area."
1,"Lovely This is such a lovely blouse! the color is true to the picture. i am a bigger girl--5'9"" and size 12, and i bought the large. the fit was beautiful--it was forgiving on my less-than-perfect midsection, but wasn't billowy at all. it did not pull around the shoulders or bust the way some button-up blouses do."
0,Cute but not on me This dress looks so elegant and perfect for transition from work to night. it looks great on the model but it looked terrible on my. it's a lovely material but the middle added girth to my stomach area which i did not care for.
1,Great top This top is perfect! very comfortable and flattering for any body type.
1," I was disappointed when the dress came in the mail. it was much shorter on my than on the model in the picture. (i am 5'5"") the detail of the dress and fabric shown in the picture is not as prominent in person which was also disappointing. the dress is just average. i didn't not return the dress...it looks much better on my younger sister (who is the same height) so i gave it to her. i guess it's just not the right dress for me."
1,This tunic fits perfectly! This tunic is beautiful! the color is a vibrant blue. i can wear it with jeans or dress it up with my white linen capris! i ordered the small and it fits me perfectly!!!
1, Love this top!! so comfy and flattering. i ordered the black and the blue and i am itching to get the red/purple one too!
1,Pretty- soft fabric and nice color. I tried this in the store and i liked it. the color is very pretty and the fabric is soft and drapey and feels like good quality. i like the little subtle dots. i ultimately did not buy it because the tie at the throat is not my style and because i just don't need this kind of piece enough in my wardrobe at the moment. but it is a very nice top and i would recommend it if you like the color and style.
1,"For the right body type it could work I got this number in the turquoise and i hadn't expected the skirt to be ribbed! are they all like that? retailer was out of the petites, so i sized down in a regular instead -- yeah, that didn't work. i definitely needed the petite version and perhaps should have even sized up. the bust was scandelously tight. in the end the dress wasn't flattering on my figure the way this style usually is on me -- the proportions were off somehow. it's just not one of those dresses that curvy petite girls shoul"
0,Way too big After reading the previous reviews i thought sizing down would be a great idea. as soon as i pulled it out of the bag i knew that the xs/s was still wayyy too big. for reference i am 5'3 and a 34ddd and usually wear an 8 but this thing was enormous. it was shapeless and boxy but done so horribly it looked like i was pregnant. it has an adjustable draw string at the bottom which helps to make you look like a balloon. such a disappointment. the design was lovely and it looked very high quality and
1,"Perfect! Bought this shirt in the colorful polka dot print and i'm obsessed! like previous reviews mentioned, it runs a little small in the chest. i'm normally a medium but am a 36c so ordered the large and it fits perfect! with the way the buttons are spaced i think all sizes will pull a little no matter what. it's a beautiful shirt and i plan on ordering the blue one as well."
1,"Flattering feminine dress This dress hits flatters the whole body. love the three quarter sleeves, love the relaxed fit of the bottom half. love how it is fitted, body conscious around bust. super flattering. the teal color is particularly gorgeous. a color that would suit a lot of different skin tones. this is a no-brainer dress that you will reach for in your closet every single time."
0,"Wish this worked! This looks great on the model but when it arrived, i couldn't believe it was the same jacket. it looks a bit like a really loose garbage bag on me and no amount of adjusting drawstrings is going to fix it. i really wanted to like it, but even the xs/s was too baggy. also a bit worried based on other reviews that it isn't actually a rain jacket and wont keep you dry."
0, I never write reviews
1,"Flattering if you have a tummy! I've got the post-baby bulge and this dress makes me the hottest i've looked in a long time! fitted, but skimming where i don't want to be accentuated - it's a rare dress that can pull this off! the cleavage is there, so i think it's more of a night dress, but i'd wear it with a sweater during the day. very comfortable."
1,Super soft and comfortable I'm a 34c and 136 lbs. i bought this in m in two colors because i love it so much! the fit is so flattering and the material is so soft and comfortable. i continue to get the best quality and fitting dresses from retailer!
0,"Extremely disappointed Saw this on line and decided to ""splurge"" for the holidays. arrived today and is going right back. runs very small especially in the waist. trim is a cheap ribbed fabric with a zipper. fabric is not elegant looking as in the picture, appears cheap and very itchy. sooooo disappointed."
1,"Romantic peasant top I bought this top in the black motif and it is easily one of my new go to tops. can wear it to brunch, work, and happy hours, it always looks good! such a great buy."
0,"Not for curvy hips This dress was ok - i thought the fabric was soft, but not my favorite. it's a pull on dress that would be easy to dress up or down. but, i have bigger hips and this dress was really not flattering on my - would be better on a different body type."
0," I love the fabric however the overall fit did not work for me. 
i think the arms are much smaller than the overall shirt."
1,"My new favorite shirt This is one of the best things i have ever bought from anrtho. it is very flattering, and i always get compliments when i wear it. must have!"
1,"Love this romper I ordered both a small and a medium because i have lost weight and seem to be in between sizes currently. lately i am anywhere from a 6 to a 10 in most retailer sizes. almost 5'4"" and @140 lbs. i could have gotten away with the small. but my bust size is 36c/d. the small fit but didn't hang as well or feel as comfortable around the chest as the medium. i agree with a previous reviewer that this romper does have a tendency to hang awkwardly at the waist until and unless you pull the drawstring tigh"
1,Great top for pregnant women:) I recently bought this top in both the black and blue motifs and love it! i'm currently 7 months pregnant and this top provides great coverage for the bump. i agree with another reviewer that noted that it is a little tight in the bust as i had to go up a size for that reason.
1,"Love love love This is the rare metallic that doesn&#39;t itch - really well made (italy) - lightweight - it&#39;s a total go!

i usually wear a large - but i bought a medium (i tried it on in the dressing room - i  think it looks better &#39;fit&#39; than oversized preppy - i wear a 38b bra / size 12"
1,"Runs small I typically wear either a 2 or 4 and had to size up with this coat. the 6 fit, but i decided to go with an 8 to ensure it'd fit with layers. the sleeves aren't lined, so it's a little itchy against bare arms. it's really flattering and i love the pattern!"
0,Just meh I was excited about this - - such a lovely look online. but on me...it was just meh. i'm a little heavy right now so that could be playing into it...but i will say i loved the top part of the dress. very flattering and subtly sexy. but the bottom..it just hangs like a rag. it needs either more material for a swishier effect...or it needs to be a different material. or maybe knit just doesn't work on me in the form of a dress! the knit is nice but i kind of also feel like it is chintzy...i can't
0,"Strange shirt This shirt was strange. the bow tie was too thin and the dots were too dominant on the shirt. it looks okay in the model picture, but when i tried it on the bow and the dots just clashed."
1," Hands down, my new favorite top! love the look of this top! i would say this runs a little big. i definitely could have sized down. however, the flowy style of my usual retailer size works for me in this piece."
1,"Ok dress The dress fits true to size and is pretty comfortable. i did look kinda matronly with my 34d chest. it's a good basic to have on your closet, but i ended up returning the one i bought. it didn't feel special enough to keep."
1,Perfect comfy black dress I got this dress to wear for christmas and it is perfect. looks great and is very comfy. low cut in front and back that is not too revealing and allows for perfect bra coverages. i got it in a small small.
0," I love maeve tops. i love the material and feel of this brand. when i saw the new tops that came out i ran to my local store to try one on. i'm usually a large in a top, once in a while an xl. they only had a large to try so i tried it in the black motif.
i could barely get the top on. it looked like i was missing 1/2 of the top. i doubled checked the size and it was a large.
it's a shame, the top is really cute. if you are the least bit broad or busty, go up a size or two. if you are usually a"
1,"Very cute! I have been looking at rompers for a while but being that i'm 40, a lot of stores seem to carry rompers that are super short. i think these are the perfect length for summer (and for me!). it's cute! i am 5'5"" and 110 pounds and i ordered the xs. i docked one start because the top part seems to have a bit of excess fabric. if i pull the waist up, the top 1/2 balloons out a little awkwardly. but if i pull the shorts down so that the drawstring is resting lower than my natural waist, it looks okay"
1,Pretty in blue This top is beautiful in color and fabric. unfortunately just didn't work in the breast line. gapped and there was just nothing i could do to make it hang correctly. i'm not really large in the chest area (38b) but the large just didn't work. had to send it back.
1, Extremely soft and comfortable. fit very well. should travel really well.
1,Really pretty but runs small I loved this but it made my stomach look a lot bigger then it is. i would recommend going up a size in it
1,"On the fence about this one I find this romper looks much more crisp on the picure than in real life. i find it more slouchier and shapeless even though i went with my ""smaller size"". the material is very soft, but thin, that is maybe the reason. i am not sure if i am going to keep. i wanted a bit more stunning look for my money. not saying this might be a great romper for somebody else however"
1,"Perfect in every way! I love this top so much. i dare say it is one of my favorite retailer purchases to date. i got it in the blue and it is really magical! i get compliments every time i wear it. i have a pair of dressier black leggings that i never know what to wear with, i'm not really a leggings person. but this tunic is exactly the piece! plus, this tunic comes with pockets. what's better than that??!"
1,Nice but large/boxy I'm normally a 10/12 and ordered the m/l. the body was a little big but ok. the arms are really wide. there are snaps to make them tighter but it doesn't do much. i do like the embroidery. it's an ok jacket but the fit could have been better.
1,"Colorful dots The tunic shown here (black and white) is the style i purchased, but not the color scheme. the one i got has a navy background with colorful large dots. the top is very cute, but has one drawback. it has covered buttons all the way down...and the top area gaps a bit so you can see your bra. i remedied the situation by sewing down the area on the placket around the top two buttons. worked like a charm! my new favorite top."
0," I'm worried about the quality of the shirt. it looks like it may snag easily. i've decided to keep it, so hopefully i will get some use out of it. in hindsight i would have not bought it when considering the price and quality of the shirt."
1,"Wonderfully snug yet stretchy and elegant I hate buying dresses because i rarely find one that fits well. i'm very petite on top (xsmall) and small/med on bottom, 5'8"". usually dresses are tight on my hips & thighs and loose up top. this fairly lightweight yet warm dress is such a winner! form-fitting yet stretchy and forgiving in all the right places. the x-small and small both fit pretty well but i decided to go with the x-small on this one. i think this will be a staple winter/fall dress. loved the fit so much i bought it in the peac"
1,"Beautiful coat but thin fabric This coat looks great, but the fabric is thin--only partly wool. the snaps also don&amp;amp;#39;t stay shut very well; i&amp;amp;#39;ll probably add a hook-and-eye closure for security. despite its flaws, it looks good enough that it&amp;amp;#39;s a keeper (when purchased on-sale)."
1,Super cute! This is the perfect jacket to throw on for errands around town. picture doesn't do it justice...very unique and stylish. love the three-quarter sleeves for this time of year.
1,"Great shape and flow This is a great piece, which has flow, grace, and charm. the blue is a beautiful color! i love it and received numerous complements after wearing it one time."
1," The dress is well-made and very nice, just didn't suit all of my lumps and bumps. wasn't super forgiving. also, i'm 5'8"" and it was a bit shorter than i expected. otherwise, a great dress!"
0,"Cute but too many fit/fabric issues It's a cute topper. it fits nicely through the shoulders and arms, and because of the a-line, through the bottom. but the chest is 3 sizes too small and i don't have a big chest. the fabric is very scratchy, and mine arrived unbuttoned and unzipped, and i suspect it had been worn.

going back. not tracy reese's best piece."
1,Great dress Looks professional but wears like a sweater! so comfy!
1,Great go to dress This dress is comfortable and a great go to dress to wear to work and then after for drinks with friends.
1,"Amazing! I love this tunic, super flattering + long enough (if your no super tall like me) to wear with leggings! it does run a little big, i like tops a little looser on me so i didn't mind that. i ordered a small- if your typically a small and prefer more fitted tops i would suggest sizing down. 

i bought the blue tunic first (the pictures don't do the textile design justice!) i loved it so much i went back online and purchased this tunic in black!!!

thanks retailer for being awesome!"
0,"More like a rain poncho I don't mind loose-fitting clothing, but to say that this product runs large is an understatement. no amount of pulling, tying, pinching could help me get this jacket to fall the way it does on the model in the photo. the arm holes are a foot in diameter for artistic purposes, and the jacket itself is meant to flow far away from the body, i guess. if you try to taper it in with the strings, then end result resembles a rounded beach ball. very disappointed, especially since the design on the fabr"
1,"Fun and flirty I purchased this top in the black color and absolutely love it! it is very fun and can be either dressed up or down. i would wear this to work as well as out and about around town. it is worn loose, so i ordered a size down. i cannot wait to wear it through spring and summer!"
1,"Flattering I ordered this in the navy and the red/blue plaid. fit- i'm usually a 10 m. after reading reviews, i ordered a l and it was the right choice. it's silky and covers up my postpartum middle nicely. i was worried the pleats would accentuate that part of me, but it does not at all. print- love the plaid. not sure about the navy with diff color dots. that one is probably going back."
1,"Perfect for layering While this shirt does run a little large, i am 5' 0"" and ordered a petite small, it is perfect for layering under a loose cardigan. can be dressed up or down- looking forward to wearing it this summer!"
1,Cute top I was pleasantly surprised to find this piece in stock at my local store. it's a very comfortable top with plenty of room. the only criticism i have regarding it is that it's a bit maternity-esque. bought it in an xs.
1,Nice cotton bomber jacket I initially ordered the grey in a m per my usual sizing but on trying it on realized that the m was a bit frumpy and there was a lot of additional fabric at the back which tended to wrinkle very easily because it is cotton. i sized down to a s and was much happier with the fit and the overall look of the jacket. but i think this jacket may need some ironing once in a while. the grey color is a darker grey as per the product description and the pictures.
1,"Iconic retailer I'm always thrilled to find a piece like this at retailer - just received my dress and couldn't be happier! beautifully made and fits absolutely perfectly. i'm 5'5"" 118 lbs. and am very comfortable in the small (with a little breathing room). length is perfect with heels. planning to wear it with sandals to a birthday party this month and then into fall and winter with boots and a top layer. if you're hesitating, go for it!"
0,"Pretty, but stiff I am 5'7, 115 lbs, and tried on a 0. the dress (red) looked great and i loved how it had a slimming effect, and i could wear this to work and the length is appropriate. it fit great, but it was a pain to get out of for some reason. i tried to get out of it through the bottom, but it kept getting stuck on my hips. i eventually got it out through the head, but it was such a pain that i just got frustrated. the fabric is okay- i expected a slightly better quality fabric for the price."
0,Cropped fit The jacket was nice and soft but it was too short on my torso with a cropped fit which i'm not a fan of that style. i returned it.
1,"Comfy casual dress I love how comfortable this dress is, it does run a little large so i would order a size down. i'm 5'3"" and around 125lbs and had to exchange the xsp for an xxsp."
1,"Pockets not always good This tunic is perfect from the waist up. the problems comes in with the pockets. they make the tunic bulky around the hips and who needs bulk there? the tunic is a little more gray in person than what it appears to be in the photo. i usually wear an 8 or a medium. ordered this tunic in a medium and i think it runs just a little big. i may try this in a small. if that doesn't work, i may consider having the pockets removed in the medium. just wish is wasn't so pricey for all the extra work. but i"
1," I agree a few others, it may be a little bit boxy but i don't even care because it's so beautiful! definitely a top i'm going to love long after this floral craze the fashion world is in begins to fade."
1,"Unique and beautiful but no pockets! First off, the moment i put on, i got tons of compliments from complete strangers. it truly is a unique and pretty. i am 5'3 and originally wanted the med petite for length. they were sold out so i got the xs in the regular size. that worked out good. it is a bit snug around the shoulders but not enough to go up a size. overall, xs was a good alternative to medium petite."
0," I'm returning this jacket. i tried it on after it was delivered, and was happy with the weight, cut, and color, although it's more dusty mauve than it looks in the picture. however, the stitching and the zipper are of such poor quality that i doubt  it will last very long. i actually can't get the zipper to zip at all. it's very rough and lightweight, and i'm afraid if i keep trying to force it i'll just end up breaking it. sorry to say yet another retailer item turns out to be poor quality.   thi"
1,"Amazing cardigan - getting tons of compliments! I'm so happy i purchased this cardigan!! every time i've worn it i've actually gotten compliments, from both women and men:) i was slightly undecided at first due to it's quite pricey, but i think the quality is amazing and the pattern will actually last a long time as a keeper, not just a quick trend!! i'm so happy i snagged it before it ran out!!\ i have quite muscular upper arms, and the medium fits me well. the sleeves do have some give in them, and even though i'm also broad across my shoul"
1,"Simply perfect! This was a winner retailer!!!!! bought it with my birthday discount. a bit pricey, but when i wore it (over and over again) i can see why. the material is so soft, flows beautifully and is just the right length on me. i am petite (5'3"") slender at 115 and i wear it with wedge heels, just like the model. i did iron it when i took it out of the package but have not had to iron it again.

i have received many compliments on this dress. bought the washed denim look.

thank you!!!!"
1,"Is every day too much? I got this in peach, and am not ashamed to say that i wore it almost every day in the past week - over a tee, over a dress, over a tunic...it looks good with everything! my normal size s is on the looser side compared to my other retailer bombers, but i like it for layering purposes. so soft and comfy...i have a feeling i'm going to need a backup of this one!"
1,"Love! This tunic fits exactly as shown and is so comfortable. the fabric is soft and buttery, and the lace up front is a awesome detail. happy that i went with the non-denim color because it's a gorgeous rich color that i think will transition well from season to season. love a good, cutr machine-washable tunic!"
1,"Gorgeous!! This is a very ""retailer "" piece. i love it! i wish retailer would bring back more pieces like this! anyway, the details on this sweater are so special! the sweater is sturdier and warmer than i thought it would be which is a plus. i love the drape it has to it down the front. one slight dislike is that the shoulders seem a little tight in my usual small. but, considering this sweater is completely sold out i will make it work! love it!"
1,"Must see detail The pictures of this blouse simply don't do it justice. the floral details are gorgeous. i liked it when i ordered it, but loved it on. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, curvy/athletic frame, ordered the size 4 and it fit perfectly."
1,Just beautiful I was hesitant to order this but i am really glad i did. it is just beautiful. the quality is excellent. i would like it to have more snaps so i am going to add them. i can't wait to wear it.
1, I adore this sweater....  so happy that i was able to get one.  get random compliments from strangers all the time!
1,"This jacket has it all..... First saw this jacket in the catalog, in peach, and had to have it. i received it today, and love it. its a soft, muted peach, very neutral. i ordered xl, im usually a m-l, but decided i wanted it to look big and comfy. the quality is great, feels good on. love it so much, i just ordered it in the dark grey. very classic jacket, will wear for years. one of my favorite hei hei pieces, never disappoints."
1,"Epic I love this top. in fact, when i saw in the store, i was hoping that it would go on sale. i wore it and received many compliments. the underlay provide adequate coverage so no additional cami is needed. this top does run large. i normally wear a 2 and i ordered this in a 0 and it fits perfectly. i would not order this if you are not willing to spend the money to dry clean it. it is delicate and i would not encourage washing it at home."
1,"Classic retailer This screams the old school classic retailer that we all love. it was one of my rare full price purchases because it's just perfection! i'm 5'4, 112lbs and normally and xs. however, when i tried on an xs is store i felt that it sort of swallowed me up. i went ahead and ordered an xs petite even though i rarely go with petites, but it fits perfectly. it doesn't leave room for layering, but i live in socal, so i don't need to layer often."
1,"High quality The pattern is actually knitted into the fabric instead of just printed on like i've sometimes found; the embroidery mostly serves as a highlighting feature instead of a focus. the inside of the cardigan is another layer of fabric, sort of like a double knit? but with its own, simple striped pattern. the collar looks like it might be itchy, but it only is until it gets stretched out a bit and arranged properly."
1,"Simple and stylish Definitely a great silhouette. overall, it's just a really classic look that can hang around in your closet for years before it looks dated. that said, it runs small. i often have difficulty with clothing like this since i'm a 4-6 on the top and a 10-12 on the bottom (5'7"" --- 35"" 28"" 41""!!!). my booty is definitely pushing some limits in this dress, but it does fit wearing a 6. shapewear to the rescue. conversely, my shoulders are petite, so the shoulders are a bit large. try this dress on in m"
1,"Great dress I'm 60+, in relatively decent shape, 135 lbs, and size 6 is perfect. i went for the regular rather than petite sizing, which came well below my knees, and although i would usually have a sheath dress like this hemmed up to that slim part right at the bottom of the knee, the slim silhouette shape served to lengthen the profile as a longer dress, so i left it about 3"" below the knee. the stretch allows it to hug the body, and with the right undergarments, it is super comfortable and attractive. go"
1,"Nice casual tunic for everyday I love this tunic in the carbon color on the model. the color does look different in person, more of a lighter gray. on me, the tunic runs very large. i am usually a small or medium but took the extra small in this and still have room. i agree with the other reviewers about the pockets. they do add bulk in the hip area so if this is a problem area for you, i'd avoid this tunic. overall, it's a nice tunic for everyday wear. the tie-neck adds a nice detail and makes the tunic stand out. it looks g"
1,"Gorgeous! This sweater is so lovely.. i like the fact that it's not super heavy, so you can be comfortable with a layer under it. the embroidery is beautiful. i usually get petite sizes when available, but the petite m was sold out when i purchased. i went with regular medium and am actually glad. it's not overwhelming or too long (i'm 5'2"").. in my opinion. if you're on the fence, go for it. totally worth it.."
1,"Affordable, comfortable jacket Love this jacket.  it is quite stylish and comfortable at the same time.  i was surprised at how affordable it was.  my only complaint is that it could wash you out if you have pale skin and get the peach color."
1,"Knit skirts are the best And this one has a heavenly feel to it. i know it's not 100% cashmere, but it's soft and cozy. i love the understated colors and plan to wear it with a neutral/creme sweater. perfect to take from fall into winter."
1,"Fantastic and machine washable! I bought this dress for a trip to the caribbean and really enjoyed wearing it.
i was worried it might look like a ""sack"" but i think it is both slimming and flattering. i love the interesting neckline and rolled up sleeves!! a winner."
1,Beautiful! This is very unique and stylish! the embroidery is stunning plus it is extremely comfortable. it is pretty warm. it does not itch me at all as others have noted.
1,"Beautiful sweater and so much better in person! Just purchased this sweater in store as a christmas present for my self and i'm in love! i feel the fit besides the shoulders which are somewhat narrow, is perfect. i usually wear a petite medium in everything but had to go with the regular small because they didn't have petites in the store. i tried on the regular medium and it was just slightly too big everywhere. overall i am so pleased with this purchase. so happy i popped into retailer today and saw it!"
1,"Cute bomber I really like this jacket! it runs big, so you may want to size down. the fabric was softer than i was expecting, but i really like it. very cute fall jacket!"
1,"Too beautiful to be a ""tank"" When i first saw this in the retailer catalog, i thought it was beautiful. i am a sucker for floral prints, and unique color combinations, both of which this top has. i'm 5'3"", 120 lbs and a small bust at 32b, i usually wear a size 2 but it was a little loose all around so i'd say it runs big. they had the size 2 at a low sale price in my local store so i bought it without hesitation. it's a little loose but very flattering and very good quality, i definitely recommend it if your shape is s"
1,So cute and stylish! I saw this online and just had to have it! it fits and looks exactly as pictured. excellent for spring or fall.
1,Just wonderful!! This bomber really is superb. it's everything you could want in a jacket. beautiful color that goes with so much (i got the pink) and is so trendy this fall. i am 5'4 and smaller on top so i purchased the small. i didn't want it too baggy but i probably could've sized up to a medium too.
1,"This is unusual and very pretty... ...but it does have it's problems. the neck, although it has pretty button detail at the back, is very outsized on me. i would like to see it fit a bit more snugly as by not laying flat, necklaces bunch up and are hard to wear with it. it is just sort of 'floppy' if i'm making sense. the camisole liner is nicely made and attaches with snaps at the shoulders which gives this a definite plus. the fabric is sort of like chiffon with appliqu茫漏d flowers. the color combination is beautiful and with the"
1,"Great skirt but shrunk I love this skirt, the colors and the softness. i am little disappointed though that the skirt shrunk quite significantly in a cold water hand wash after the second time of wearing. i don't know if it is the material but i followed the instructions for washing. i am going to keep the skirt because i love it so much and hope that it might stretch a little out with wear and go back to its normal size. despite the shrinkage, i highly recommend."
0, I so badly wanted this dress to work for me. the material and color is so beautiful. this had a 'sack like' fit and the side pockets accentuated my hips giving me a broader look than i would like.
1,"Beautiful I love this shirt! i wore it to a friend's baby shower and received a lot of compliments on it. the neckline and shoulders and very flattering, but then i'm not very busty, so maybe that's why it worked for me. the material is hand-wash only, but well worth it for such a unique, pretty top. i also didn't get any weird smell from this shirt nor did i think the material was too stiff."
1,"Great jacket! I recently purchased this jacket online in the rose color and it is beautiful! i usually wear an xs in retailer but purchased this in size s after trying on the grey color at the store. there was no xs to try for comparison but the s fit well and leaves room for light layers underneath. the only reason i rated it as ""runs small"" is that xs is my usual size so this may be true to size for most. i also wanted the option of zipping with layers underneath. the sleeves are long but can be rolled"
1,This is a trial and error dress This dress needs such a specific body type but that's not to say it isn't for everyone. this dress is lovely but it's a dress that you need to try on in multiple sizes to figure out which will fit. i tried this in three different sizes to find the fit it was supposed to be. i had to size up and go to petite size. i do vary between 6 and 8 and this one i ended up getting an 8p. this dress is lovely but it is a trial and error dress so don't get discouraged if you have to size up it will look love
1,"Color less blue This sweater does have a matching tie belt. it is detached, no belt loops. i'm guessing the previous reviewer accidentally threw it away with packing material. i loved this sweater on line. i could not bring myself to order it at full price. with tax it would have cost over $200, seemed too pricey for a sweater. when it was marked down to $99 with free shipping i couldn't hit buy fast enough. i was afraid it would sell out before i got through check out. my disappointment was the color. it is fa"
1,"Cute & comfy I ordered an xs regular and it barely skims the floor when i'm wearing wedges or heels - perfect! it's form fitting but not clingy, and i think it's a pretty, comfortable dress. glad i made the purchase!"
1,"Fun sweater with lots of color I really wanted to love this sweater after reading all the reviews, but it just didn't work for me. the pattern is amazing (almost a little over powering, making it one of a kind and unique) but what i didn't like the color of the knit collar and front bands----it's an old looking mauve-tweed grandpa color. i probably would have kept it if that color was different. it was returned to find a different coat style sweater."
1,"Perfection! Cool, comfortable, goes with everything! i found both colors at my local antro today!! almost ordered the grey online because that's all that was available, but decided to check my store first. so glad i did. the peach is so pretty, and looks really good with my blond hair. the grey looked much more like a faded black, darker than pictured online, imo. i would have still purchased it in grey if that's all they had, because it is such a great piece, but the peach really is lovely. i'm 5'10"" 145 p"
1,"Cool, soft tough girl vibe Agree with the positive reviews. this fits nicely with my casual lifestyle. i ordered an xl in the grey although i generally wear a large. it's a bit oversized with plenty of room for layering. it does bulge a bit in the back but the knit waistband still hits just below my waist. the only drawback is that the sleeves are a bit wide, long and loose at the wrist. it's lined in the body with a soft fleece. the sleeves aren't lined but have a soft silky fabric in the cuffs so easily rolled, adding i"
1,Pretty but not quite right This dress is really simple and elegant and i want to love it but i'm having a hard time getting it to fit right. i'm normally a size 4/6 and i bought this in an 8 and couldn't zip it up. i'm a 36d which is part of the problem so i exchanged it for a 10 and i can now zip it but the bar in the back i thought would cover my bra strap but like other reviewers mentioned its a bit high. most of my bras fall right into the hole beneath the bar. its unfortunate because i wanted to love this dress. i mi
1,Very comfortable I bought this dress to wear to a funeral. i usually wear a medium but when i tried it on it was way too big so i exchanged it for a small which fit perfectly! the side slits make the dress a bit sexy and the styling is boxy but very comfortable especially with the pockets! the fabric lies beautifully on the body. i would recommend this dress.
1,"Perfect lbd This dress is perfect for anyone with an hour glass shape,it is true to size, i am 5'3 and 125b the 2 petite fit perfectly. the fabric has a little give to it so if you have hips and a chest it will stretch a little without feeling tight and dress sinches in the waist creating a beautiful silhouette. it's the structure of this dress that makes it elegant and sexy. this dress is so figure flattering, i could not believe how many complements i've received on it."
1,"Soft & buttery! This shirt is so soft and buttery! it fits tts and just as shown on the model. for the sale price, this shirt is a gonga! good go-to shirt on those days where you're just not sure what to wear. one thing that slightly bothers me about this shirt is that the arm holes are a bit loose, so you can see your bra. i think if you wear a black bra with it though, it would be fine."
0,"Too small too small too small! This jacket is just too small for me anyway and i am no way big. i am tall and athletic and this thing looked like it had shrunk in the wash. there are so many better fitting other types out there, this went back"
0,"Weird fit. 1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 140 lbs and 38 (36d) - 32- 40. i'm normally a size 10 in most brands, and in maeve in the past. this dress was too tight across my waist and hips in a size 12, so it runs very slim.

2. this dress is very long waisted, so the top bunched up funny.

3. the horizontal bar in the back is in the wrong place, and will not hide your bra strap.

4. there are bra strap keep loops in the shoulders, but this is an off the shoulder top.

5. the underarms bunched funny.

6. the dress has h"
1,"Clown pants 1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 145 lbs, and 38-32-40 and the size 30s fit me perfectly.

2. i like the regular hyphen chinos and the stet chinos, but these pleated ones looked like clown pants because the pleats widen the hips and the ankle cuff is very tight compared to the regular hyphen chinos.

3. i hated the mustard color. not flattering to me at all."
1,"Perfecto! I love this dress, it's the right length and its very soft and comfortable. it is not really denim, just a soft grey material. i tried on the blue one in the store before ordering the grey and found that the small fit better than the medium - i'm typically a medium. usually in this brand i have to size up but in this case i sized down :-)

i highly recommend this dress is you are looking for a simple shift dress that you can just throw on and go."
1,"Swimming - size down I am a huge pilcro fan. however, these were beyond large. i am not even sure that the next size down would work. keep this in mind if you attempt these pants."
1,The perfect layer! I love this jacket! it is super soft and a gorgeous color. i can wear it with jeans and a tee or dress it up and wear it to work. so versatile! a must have for the fall season!
1,"Too big around arms The dress is beautiful, i wanted to like it and could hardly wait to reveive it. it fits beautifully, and snug except around the arms where it is huge. i could only wear it with a tshirt underneat."
1,Perfect color and fit Would buy this again in a heartbeat. so comfortable and fit is great. color will look good with jeans or a dress. bought it for a cruise in the spring and it is perfect!
1,"Adorable Like the other reviewers, i opted for the grey version. almost every tunic dress i've tried winds up looking like a sack when it's on my body, so i was very pleased when this dress looked pretty great. the neckline is perfect - nice depth and addition of on-trend lacing - and the length (love the shirttail hemline) is also perfect. the drape of the material keeps it from looking like a shapeless bag. my only comment #and it's quite minor - i'd give this 4.5 stars if i could) is that the pockets"
1,"Fun skirt This skirt fits me like a glove, you must get the matching top and orange jacket that makes the whole outfit high
fashion fun chic. i am 5' 8"" and 145 full figured and imlove this out fit. very cozy too."
0,Nice dress but way too long The dress is well made with a great material. it is extremely long and unless you are tall it would overpower many petite women. i returned it.
1,"Such a treat Birthday gift from my husband, and i have it hanging up where i can see it, the design is like a huge beautiful tapestry. although it looks heavy, the cotton has a nice feel to it. hand-embroidered here and there. i usually wear size s/m and the med. is very comfortable. gorgeous!"
1,"Adorable comfy jacket Love this jacket! saw it in the store and waited a few days before breaking down and buying it in the peach color. glad i did as it sold out super fast. it's soft, flattering, versatile, and has great detail in the stitching. perfect layer for fall. i'm usually a large, sometimes medium in hei hei jackets and the large fit very comfortably with room for light layers underneath. the style is a little boxy and slouchy but the fit in the shoulders and elastic ribbed waistband give it a flattering f"
1,"Cropped How can some reviewers say this jacket is true to size, yet others say it runs small? i think it's because this jacket is cropped. by the time i took advantage of the fall perks 20 percent discount, the xs peach was sold out so i ended up ordering size s. i also got the xs gray to compare. sure enough, the xs looks better but is cropped on me. for ref, i'm 5' 5"", 32a, 115 lbs. i don't really need another almost black jacket so i'm either sized out or have to exchange for xs peach to wear with dr"
1,"Very stretchy fabric has fit issues... I love the color and cut of the pants. they are more a dark indigo twill than a jean, to be sure. a fit issue is how the front pockets pop out because of the excessive stretchiness of the fabric. i wear them and love them, but stitched the front pockets closed to avoid the unflattering pop-out pockets."
1," I love this jacket. the color is what drew me to it and it looks just like the picture. as far as sizing goes, i'm usually a medium but i ordered a small and it fit well. i feel that if i had ordered a medium it would look a little too puffy for my taste. the small gives me a more fitted look."
1,"So flattering! Wow... i'm in love!!! when i first saw this i put it in my cart... when i went back to purchase it, it was sold out in my size... i was so bummed. i kept checking back and saw it was restocked so i quickly ordered it... thank heavens!!! when i first took it out of the box i thought it might be too ""grandma-y"" of a design... but i was wrong. it's just gorgeous! can totally be dressed up or down. so flattering. love love love it!!!"
1,"The perfect jacket. I absolutely love this jacket. as a 36 year old woman, i want items that are on trend but don't look juvenile. this jacket hits the nail on the head for me."
1," Great jacket for night time in the south this time of year ... very nice fabric, great classic style with a little twist... love retailerplogy ... being an older female, sometimes things can look boring ....i love to dress in fun clothes ... finding something that will work for all ages and that is a ""little out side the lines "" is very nice!!!!"
1,"Incredible jacket!! Woke up this morning to an email from retailer showcasing this gorgeous jacket. i knew i had to have it. trying it on in the store, it did not disappoint! hei hei is a really wonderful brand, and me being a more plus sized gal, their sizing is always wonderful. i normally do an xl in most retailer jackets and tops,..but i was able to do a l well. the arms have plenty of room and the body of the jacket has a room as well (like your typical bomber would). the fabric is soft and the blush color"
1,"Yes! Lovely dress. i was a bit hesitant as a reviewer mentioned the fabric being irritable but luckily i had no issues. the regular is long and i have to wear it with my wedge, but i'm ok with that."
1,"Cute and comfy Soft, comfortable and well made. great with sleeves rolled or down for cooler weather. interesting color- close to picture, maybe a little more orange. goes well with blues and grays."
1,"Warm and fun for the season It's no surprise that this sweater coat is getting five stars. it's beautifully made, has a fun pattern, and fits great.

i purchased the xs (regular size). there weren't any of the petite sizes left for me but the xs fits perfectly. the sleeves hit at my wrist (i'm 5'2"") while the length hits right at the top of my knees. i did notice that the shoulder width could be too tight if you are a more broad person.

the colors are accurate to the website and catalog. this seems so extremely versatile"
1,"Bomber jacket I usually wear a medium, and this jacket was no exception. the jacket is a shorter style as pictured. it is still flattering, even though it is a little boxy. i got the grey, which is a dark gray/slight greige color. if you like edgier over boho, this is a cute transitional jacket."
0, Love the tegan tunic version of this dress. i assumed since it looked identical except for the length that the sizing was the same but i was wrong. this runs so big! i got a s in the tegan but the s in this dress looked like an oversized potato sack on. i highly recommend ordering at least 2 sizes down unless you want to look tent-y.
1,"Love the cropped flare! These jeans have definitely made me an ag convert. the fit is perfection and at 5'3"", it is so to buy jeans and simply wear them (without the typical extra 4-6"" of length)."
1, Super cute jacket .perfect for fall i can't stop wearing it
1,"Truly retailer This. this you have to buy! i just tried it on in our new store the other night and am in love. gorgeous details went into the sweater coat. it's thinner than most, which is nice when you want to look lovely but don't quite need to bundle up! i plan on purchasing after christmas if it's still around!"
1," I bought this jacket in the gray and couldn't be happier with it. it is loose fitting but not oversized. it will look great over a dress with boots, or with jeans. very versatile piece."
1,"Cozy, but runs large I like the unique design and it's warm and cozy. i wear a medium 95% of the time, but had to exchange this for a small, but the sleeves are still long enough. it sheds a bit, but i'm guessing it will slow over time."
1," I don't own any peach outerwear because i didn't think it would complement my skintone. this cozy bomber proved me wrong. wonderful quilting pattern and a vintage dye job that's eye catching. great for layering and the color goes with my autumn and spring wardrobe. this is not a fitted style, it's relaxed and a bit poufy at the sleeves and waist, just like a regular bomber jacket. i chose medium petite and it fits just right. i'm a 36d, 135#, 38-28-35."
1,"Finally in my hands Delayed for a month on back order, this dress was worth the wait!  the beautiful design and colors are just as shown in the pictures.  the length and cut is slimming, more fitted at the bodice with a subtle flare after the waist.  detachable liner dress is a stetchy tank top that goes to the knees.  pullover style with a closed-end side zip that's needed because the knit band design under the bust does not stretch at all.  


if your skin is sensitive--this dress isn't for you.  both the line"
1,"Size down! Wish they had more colors in these pants. the dark grey is very nice, but i'd definitely take another color if offered. very cute pants. a fantastic deal at the sale price. but size down! they run a full size too big."
1,"Soft & beautiful! The sweater and skirt are so pretty! they're really soft and have such an easy, comfortable look together. really love this gorgeous outfit.

i am borderline small/medium and kept the size small after trying both on."
1, This picture doesn't do the skirt justice. i paired it with a creme colored cashmere cowlneck sweater and a silver jeweled belt. it is really pretty and flattering on.
1,"Such a beauty Ordered it in small regular and xtra small petite. what was surprising was that the xtra small petite fit better (meaning more room) across the chest. i'm normally a medium or medium petite, but this runs large. if you're unsure of a size, get both and return the one that doesn't fit as well. it's much better in person and looks very rich in colors and quality. the only complaint i have is there were some loose yarn pieces just dangling off the edges. i trimmed up with scissors and they didn't e"
1,"Great dress Love this dress! it can be dressed up or down and its very comfortable. i got the ps, but could have probably fit into a pxs since the style is rather loose."
0,"Unflattering I'm happy the other reviewers made this dress work because it looked terrible on me. i'm 5,9"" and 128 lbs and it made me look like i had gained 25 lbs. as others have said, the pockets make the dress even worse-it's very hard to get them to lay flat. the material is lovely, soft and i liked the gray color, but this dress made me feel like i was wearing something from an asylum."
1,"Beautiful Great sweater to brighten those gloomy winter days. this is a beautiful sweater, soft, colorful. perfect."
1,"The perfect dress I tried this dress at the store and fell in love with it but they only had the red dress (my size). trust me, the red is absolutely beautiful but i needed a black dress so i purchased it online. i just can't wait for it to arrive!
it fits perfectly and it's so classy."
1, Love the jacket! so versatile! would probably order up a size if you like a loose fit.
1,"Favorite sweater I just received this sweater last week and love it. the material is so much softer and lighter than i expected, but plenty warm. the neck is slightly itchy, but not bad at all. i wore this sweater to church over a navy dress on sunday and received tons of compliments. it is such a unique piece."
1,"Foret cardigan Love,love, love this. it is so different and unique. definitely not something you will see in any other store. wore it last week and have never received so many compliments on one piece. so retailer!!!!!! it was very warm and comfortable. i did wear a turtleneck under this, because of reviews of itching. i did not have any problems."
1,"Perfect fall jacket Loved this from the minute i saw it in an email. i got the blue grey in a medium. i'm 5'4"", 140. it's a little roomy but will be nice over sweaters too. i love the cropped length. really well made."
1,"Stylish lucsiously soft sweater! I see no one has reviewed this yet and since it is a beautiful sweater, and only available online, i thought i would contribute an opinion. the sweater is nicer in real life than the photo. it has a wonderful feel! the style: this sweater has very dramatic sleeves which i like though i could understand how that might annoy someone else. it is made with a heavy thick soft yarn so the sleeves hang nicely. i have worn it once and got complements so it is a sweater that while simple, is also a stand"
1,"Uniquely cute First of all i love retailer, i am 67 yrs old and my whole closet comes from the store. this jacket is way cute. the color is very nice and the fabric is nice. only complaint is i wish the cuffs were just a bit tighter/smaller."
1,Gorgeous skirt This skirt is so soft and warm! looks gorgeous with middi boots or ankle boots. colors are beautiful and the length is perfect to take you into spring!
1,Amazing This dress is amazing! i have a b cup and didn't quite fill out the top enough. but that is a small tailoring fix. i am completly in love with this dress and recommend it highly
1,"Pockets stick out on the sides What the picture doesn't show, is that there are pockets on the side seams that do add a bit to the hip area. also, the dress runs very large, in my opinion. i ordered a medium (my usual size) and everything was loose. i am going to exchange it for a small and hope the proportions stay the same because it's very pretty.

it is very boxy, and kind of nightgown looking when it's big, so if you wouldn't want it to cling a bit this might not be a good dress. the fabric is gorgeous and soft, but be a"
0,"Just ok cowl sweater Gorgeous color and fit, but fabric is not great. i ordered this to wear with leggings and booties. i returned as i could tell it would get baggy in the elbows and rear end. just not a good fabric. bummer!!!!"
1,Very flattering but between seasons This is beautiful on. it flatters the figure nicely. the material is a rougher cotton which seems oppressive for summer even though thin. it is very low cut but it looks wonderful.
1,"Love at first sight! Aesthetically pleasing and very well-made. love it! but, does run large."
1," Absolutely stunning top! love! what a great buy on sale! i wear a medium/large and purchased the size 12...fits perfect! beware that the bottom has somewhat of a flair! the material is light so i would say this top is something to be worn transitioning between seasons, late summer to fall!"
1,"Great style but lacking quality I agree with the reviewer that said this product photo is misleading! you can't possibly wear this sweater off the shoulder as pictured! it does however provide a great fit, i sized down from large to medium...and the brown color is really pretty!"
1,"Nice, but odd fit (for me) I'm thinking that this might be a hit for the petites out there, but it didn't quite work on my long torso. the seam across the bust fell a little too high making the shirt ride up and the sleeve ended at a weird spot (not quite 3/4 sleeves, and also not long sleeves...but there is a band that makes it feel weird). the v-neck in the front is low, but offered full coverage on my 34a bust, but i can see it being pretty revealing on someone better endowed. fabric and color is nice, and it's a prett"
1,"Perfection I can't wait to wear this,but it has been to hot in the south.you can wear this so many ways.the material is wonderful, and the pattern better in person."
0,"Just okay I first have to agree with other reviewers about the quality of this sweater: the stitch is pretty, but the fabric isn't nearly as soft as i expected. it has the look and feel of a cheaper sweater. that said, the fit is pretty flattering. i didn't have any problem getting the cowl over my shoulders as pictured by the model. i've been looking for this style of sweater, so i'll probably keep it. however, it really didn't meet my expectations for quality."
0,"Dissapointed I love the ethnic colors & the creative woven design of this garment. that's what attracted me in the first place. however, some of the metallic threads had snagged & i thought the loose weave & acrylic yarns would lead to more snags & it would eventually stretch out of shape. also, it's very big. too bad it doesn't come smaller. in the online picture, it must have been gathered & clipped behind the model because it really doesn't fit close like that & the long armholes are not visible online as"
1,"Easy throw on This piece is a great, easy throw on that allows you to still look polished. it's heavy weight is a perfect substitute for a coat on those in-between fall weather days when you don't want to lug a jacket around. lining is super soft and makes it so comfortable to wear."
1,"Perfect fall sweater Bought this in navy - going to buy another one in a different color!  it fits my curves beautifully!  does not look ""boxy"" like other tunic sweaters.  i also disagree with other reviews, i cannot see through it."
1,Lovely sweater! Loved this online and even better in person. inner lining is like a cozy sweatshirt!
1,"Great tunic! This sweater is super flattering. love the cowl neck and longer length. it is not boxy or shapeless, but manages to show off your figure without clinging anywhere. i did not find any of the colors to be see through as some other reviewers had noted.  i purchased the navy and think i'll go back for the brown as well!  size down if between sizes.  i am 5'7"" and busty, and the medium fit great."
1,Not what i expected The description doesn't indicate the metallic thread throughout the design. you cannot tell from the pix either. it's also a really strange design with the arm holes being almost the entire length of the sweater. can't decide if i want to keep it or return it.
1,"Pretty but... I really had high hopes for this sweater however, unfortunately it is not as nice as i expected it to be. i own a few angel of the north sweaters and i really don't feel like this particular sweater meets their usual standard. first of all the yarn feels very cheap and is not very soft. secondly, the actual knit also appears to be very cheap. i ordered the white sweater in my usual size medium and while it fits, i really can't see how they were able to get the neck of the sweater to go off the m"
1,"Lightweight sweater, runs a bit large I initially bought this in the brown in a small but ended up exchanging it for an xs in ivory. as other reviewers have said, it's not the softest sweater you'll try on. if you want it to lightly hug your body like the way it is on the model, you may need to size down. while i love the style, it feels like the type of material that will get stretched out easily so i've been careful getting it on and off. i picked this up during retailer days and got it on sale. the quality is of the yarn is just of"
0,"Big busts not allowed! This top looked positively vulgar on!!!! i am a 34d, and it was way too low cut...my boobs were spilling out!!! in addition, the fabric reminded me of a cheese cloth.....it just looked and felt cheap. unfortunately, this top will be going back."
1," I agree with previous review...looks so much better in person than online! i really do not need another poncho style sweater, but i could not resist. they colors and style are great!"
0,"Too small I ordered a large and despite wearing a large in many other items from antrhopologie, this item was too small, especailly across the bust. it was very well-made and the color green is beautiful, but unfortunately, i will not be able to wear it. so disappointed."
1,"Beautiful, but not quite right for me! The fabric is really gorgeous, and the lining is lovely and soft. unfortunately being on the petite (short) side, it just didn't look quite right on me. i felt a little swallowed up. i wish it had worked because it's so lovely!!"
1,"Beautiful but thin I am very petite (size 00, xxs) and i got the smallest size this top came in and it fit great in the bust and arms but the bottom billowed out a little too much for my body frame type. it is so beautiful i had considered getting it altered, but the material was simply too see through so it had to go back. beautiful gauze material and detailing though!"
1,So pretty but not great quality I must agree with some of the other reviewers--this sweater is so pretty! but the quality of the sweater is not great. my sensitive skin found it to be itchy. so sadly i had to return it.
1,"Almost ,but not quite... I really wanted to love this top when i got it, but not so much. it fit nicely through the bust and torso, but flared out way too much, it ended up looking like a maternity top. maybe because i am more of an hourglass shape. another thing, it was very low cut, i would not have been able to wear this without a cami underneath. the fabric didn't seem to be the best quality, it also had a funny smell too it when i took it out of the package. this shirt was not worth the price. sadly, this was a mis"
0, I usually love a cowl neck sweater but not this one. you can't wear it off the shoulders and it's weirdly sheer too. the only pro is that it doesn't include wool or fur.
1,"Perfect cape for hourglasses I kept stalking this cape on the site since it went on a few months ago and finally decided to pull the trigger. this is an absolutely gorgeous cape.perfect for hourglass figures because of the waist-defining belt. its a really modern cut - it reminds me of some of the red carpet cape dresses of late. its so elegant - this is a timeless cut. the nude is a gorgeous, rich warm brown color. if you're really busty, you might go up a size to get the girls covered. i ordered my usual size m, and i may"
1,"Nice top I ordered this top from store. i'm 5'3"" and 114 lbs, i ordered size 4, fir very nice, just front is little to low for me, but i wear ten top , it will be fine. the style and material are amazing, love it!"
1,Flattering and warm Comfortable and warm. i will wear this a lot this winter.
1,"Great unique piece I have been admiring this piece for awhile and finally decided to purchase it, and i am so happy i did! the yellow is the perfect pop of color for fall/winter, but it isn't overwhelming or overpowering. fit is oversized (as is in any poncho style sweater) but it doesn't feel boxy or unflattering. if in between sizes, definitely go down. i like things oversized and i went with the xs/s and it fits great. this will be a go to piece for many years to come!"
1,"Perfection Absolutely lovely! even better in real life. this is not your typical cheap, flimsy dress. this is quality! the fabric is interesting, the color is gorgeous and the styling is flattering. pay attention to the length ? there are miles of fabric in that fortuny-esque skirt and the model is very tall. i am 5'5"" and slim, and ordered petite small, and it's a little longer on me than it is on the model. i don't mind. i've been looking for a special-occasion dress for a long time and knew this was it"
1,"Amazing poncho Walked into the retailer store in new york, while on vacation, and saw this on display. had to try it on immediately and loved the look. received several compliments from customers in the store. it's beautifully made, soft on the inside and makes a great statement piece that i will enjoy for years to come!! you will need to size down cause it runs large. i love it............"
1,"The perfect fall sweater I love this sweater. i ordered the xs because i have very narrow hips and i didn't want it to be too baggy. it fits a little like a very short sweater dress on me. what i really love is that the arms are nice and long. one of my pet peeves is sweaters that are compromised in arm length. 
i bought the pink and plan to get at least one other color too!"
0,"Looked like an oversize muumuu I really loved the look of this dress online and couldn't wait to try it on. based on my measurements i ordered a petite medium, following the petite size chart. the dress was the perfect length for my 5'5 frame, but it was just way too loose and not flattering on my figure. i'm 36c-32-37 and i looked like a sack of potatoes in the dress. the fabric and lining feel great though. i just wasn't the right fit for me."
0," The sweater is nice but is very thin. it is see-through which does not make it a good fall/winter item for me. the design & structure of the sweater is nice & looks slimming on which is a bonus. i originally ordered my regular size (s) but had to upgrade to a large in order to get the neck to fall on my shoulder as shown in the picture. this wasn't a problem since the sweater is form fitting so getting the larger size did not make it look too big. overall, i did not keep the seater as i thought"
1," I loved this sweater! it is a little thin, so i will probably wear a tank under it, but you could probably get away without one, i am normally either an xs or a small, and i got the xs in this sweater. the bottom is a little loose like in the models photo, but i really like it."
1,Worth every penny! The material this top is made of is extremely comfortable and flattering for my body type.  i normally wear 12/14 and 12 fit great (if you have a d or bigger you may need a bigger size) spillage is possible with wrong size lol.
1,"Amazing, timeless piece! This cape/poncho item is totally amazing. from the moment it whispered over my head as it slipped past my hair, i knew i had to have it. this piece is magical. it feels like you're wearing a blanket (the warmth factor), but the length is so perfect that it doesn't overwhelm you, nor does it make you look like a tank. the colors are amazingly saturated and the quality is so worth the price. the model is wearing it with light brown, but i tried it on over black leggings in the store and it works w"
1,Beautiful color! This dress is a beautiful color and is so lightweight and flowing. will be perfect for a fall wedding that i am attending. it is supposed to be loose so i think it is relatively true to size if not just a bit on the large side. will look great with a kimono or other wrap when the weather is a bit chilly.
1,"Didn't work for me I agree with the other reviewer that the belted part definitely gives some great definition for those with a defined waist and that it's a much lovelier color in person, but that's about it for me. thoughts below:
_____________
pros:
- tts. i ordered the medium for my 36c, 5'9"" frame and found it sufficient.
- the color is much nicer in person, as the other reviewer mentioned. it's a richer brown. think ""mocha latte"" in terms of color.
- the belt really helps tie it all together and keep it"
1,Wonderful! I am so surprised this was not styled properly in the photo! if worn the way it should be worn it would have sold out before going on sale. yes it is open down each side but you need to slide a belt inside the back so the back is left full and bring the belt out into the front on sides cinching in the front...making this a dramaticly gorgeous piece! i love it and will wear it with my leather jeans to pencil skirt. i am a personal stylist and designer and if you are thinking about this piece jump
1,"Flattering top I bought the white in my usual xs size, i don't agree with some of the other reviews that say it is thin, because it is not a sweater. it is a pullover in a kind of waffle weave fabric , not a sweater knit. very cute with a flattering fit. casual wear."
1,"Much too big This top is so lovely, but runs soo big. i ordered it online and was so surprised when i tried it on at home. i'm normally a size 14, and i was positively swimming in this top. hoping to exchange for a petite sm."
0,"It's huge. No, but i'm not a small person. i'm 5'8, a size 6 on top, 8 on bottom. i don't love this on the model online, but i saw this on naomi's blog, love taza, and thought it looked amazing. i tried it on in my retailer, and while they only had a m/l, since i'm tall, i figured that'd be fine. oh. no. not fine. it's huge. like, it could almost cover a twin bed. it was a couple inches longer on me than on the model, and doesn't arc down in a drape nearly as well, so just looks, huuuge. i thought i was bein"
1,"Transitional magic Perfect dress for the hot late summer/early autumn weeks! this beauty is flowy and rich in color. the tie back is adjustable which i love due to my weight fluctuations. because of the tie, length can be adjustable too! i'm short so the decision lies on what shoes i want to wear and how high i want my hem. this dress looks cute belted or with my cropped moto jacket thrown on top. all in all, i really like this dress and i see it staying in my closet for a long while if the horrid viscose construc"
1,Wear it and receive lots of compliments. I wore it belted with a close fitting cami beneath because the sweater is open down both sides. be creative and wear it different ways.
1,"Beautiful sweater! I disagree with the other review. i purchased the xxsp in navy and i think the sweater fits true to what is shown on the retailer-model. the sweater knit is lighter weight, it is not heavy. it fits more tightly to the body, which i like. the material is soft to me and navy color has a gray-tone to it. i did not find it difficult to wear the sweater off of the shoulders at all. if you are looking for a heavier sweater this is not for you. if you do not want a body skimming sweater this is not for y"
1,"Gorgeous I bought this on a whim, and i love it. the colors are much brighter than the photo would indicate. it's definitely a poncho - oversize is the name of the game - but it's cozy, gorgeous and i wish i could wear it every day."
1,"Love this skirt--get it This is a beautiful skirt and such a great piece to collect from erin fetherston.

the design and cut are very flattering on a variety of body types. i have more of a curvy shape and love this type of cut to accentuate my smaller waste (rather than fitted dresses/skirts that hug).

there are several linings that help give shape and volume. the stripes are made of ribbon. it's so gorgeous, i've received many compliments. i've paired with a sequin tank and glitter keds by kate spade...it's a dynam"
1,"Zowie! This skirt is going to be perfect for the hot texas summers. super lightweight and floaty, and the pattern is so gorgeous. will go great with my favorite purple shoes!"
0,"Non-existent waistband Ordered on line and thought these are a great quality as i pulled them out of the box. tried them on and found minimal elastic for the waist. within minutes of wearing, the waist fell down past my hips...glad i was at home. looks cute but will not stay up."
1,"Versatile I absolutely love slips, and i like the grey tone of this one-and that it is not super shiny. it adds to the versatility of the slip-which i wear many ways. i wear them as under layers for long cardigans, i wear them as a real traditional slip under other dresses, and i also have been known to wear them to bed. the fabric on this one is absolutely comfortable and lightweight. i like that the fabric is cut in a babydoll format and the straps are wider (an a different color) which adds just enough"
0,"Waist falls down! I ordered these pants in my usual size (xl) and was shocked when i received them. the waist was huge and there was nothing in the way of an elastic or tie to keep them up. i couldn't keep them on so, of course, back they go! too bad! the sweater quality is great."
1,Need to see it in person What a classy special top. really dresses up a pair of black slacks. i actually think this is a perfect spring piece!
1,"Stylish, warm, comfy . . . but, oops! I love these leggings - they look and feel great, but i can't wear them out of the house! there is no elastic in the waistband, so they are constantly falling down. i won't dare wear them out, for fear they will fall down when i walk across the street. everything else about the leggings is exactly what i was looking for: style, comfort, and warmth. they are great for curling up to read a good book in front of the fire; not for doing anything active."
0,"No elasticity :( I wanted to love these, they are cute and warm - but they have absolutely no elasticity. i'm so mad at myself for not reading the reviews because i ended up wasting money on shipping 2 pairs of leggings that i ultimately took right back to the store."
1,"Soft and lovely. Pretty detail, fits nicely. i feel it runs very tts. it's a lot, though. fuzzy and detailed. it definitely takes over the outfit. i wonder about shedding as well if you pair it with dark pants or jeans...? it would be gorgeous with simple winter white pants at a holiday event. still on the fence, i don't know if its for me."
0,"Wanted to love it, but... I saw the colors and texture of this top and wanted to love it however when i put it on it just did not work. the cut was so strange. it runs very small in the shoulders and then flairs out so much at the waist. i even ordered up a size based on reviews. i ordered an 8 when i normally where a small (6) in things. the shoulders were still too small and it was way too big every where else."
1,"Good fit Good fit, quality, similar to the brand's other jeans."
1,"So soft, pretty and unique This sweater was just what i was looking for.  it is so soft & comfortable.  the design is unique and delicate, yet doesn't shed or itch.  the decorations are not as pure white as pictured, there are several different tones of ivories & creams.  i ordered the xs, which is my typical size in retailer sweaters, as i find that most run very large and this is no exception.  it is oversize, but not bulky.  however, the decorations do add some volume, so maybe not for all body types."
1,"Great fit Noce color as well, only gave one less star due to thin you could see my bra quality (it was pink and i tried on the grey). otherwise, nice and soft. regular size a little long and long sleeves, but sold out n petite :-("
1,Super soft sweater This is great soft sweater that is not to bulky looking.sometimes when you have a design like this it looks good off but when you put it on it makes you look like a stuffed marshmallow. this sweater's knit is thin enough that when you add the accents it looks less bulky. wore it with winter white pants and received many compliments.
0,"Underwhelming I expected to love this, since i usually look good in this style of jacket. it's definitely comfortable and the fit was fine, but i really don't care for the wooden buttons and the overall look was just ""meh."" it's going back, unfortunately."
1,"Gorgeous, classic piece Classic retailer piece that i am so happy to have in my wardrobe. high quality all wool felt jacket. unlined, stretchy comfortable knit. i wear mine as a knit blazer and love it. it is not merino soft, but soft enough to wear over a long sleeve tee. the neck does not itch. 

fits tts, i wear a l and that is my normal retailer size. i am tempted to get the cream as well!"
1,"Great shirt Kicky little pleat in the back is interesting and comfortable. great fit, good colors and doesn't wrinkle easily."
0,"Great shape stiff fabric Love the shape of this top and often look to retailer for corset-style summer tops that are pretty. this top is made from a thick, stiff fabric that doesn't breathe. so my usual size xxs was too constricting. tried an xs also and it basically fit but i still wasn't a fan of the very heavy fabric in a summer top. it's almost like a neoprene. the colors are an odd choice and not my favorite either. i wanted to see in person and they just don't cut it for me. would love in different colors and softer"
1,"Meh The details on this dress were pretty, but it was super poofy and i felt like it made me look bigger than i am. maybe if you have a straight body and want to create curves this would work for that, but not great on an hourglass/pear shaped figure. fits tts."
1,"Fun for winter I bought these stretchy skinny cords in my usual size 28 (31 waist, 33 low waist, 38.5 hip/butt).  they are comfortable and long enough for my 5' 9"" frame.  i hope they don't shrink.  the flower pattern on all the pairs in the store has the flowers running down the inside and outside of my legs.  the dark part runs down the middle.  i wish it was like the picture on the model, with the print running right down the front and backs of the legs, dark parts on inner and outer thigh."
1,"Curves: yes This dress was exactly what i was looking for- a rich, luxurious fabric, a deep neckline, and a tightly cinched waist. i have a full bust and, while the snug waistband was a negative for some reviewers, for me it is a little miracle. this dress fit like a glove and was flattering in my usual size. thank you!"
1,"Warm but problems I recommend with reservations. these leggings are 100% wool, soft, not itchy, light weight, lovely knitted pattern. they run large. i sized down to a small. the first time i wore them they were fine. but the second time the waist stretched out and was useless: they were falling down as i walked. such a shame because everything else about them is perfect for cold winter days. they even fit under my silk skirt and would make other lighter garments wearable in winter. so what to do? at the price th"
1,"Unique and adorable The photos don't do the top justice. the split back is very unique and adorable. i typically take a size 8 in tops, but ordered a 12 since a reviewer suggested it was narrow in the shoulders. the 12 shoulder fit perfectly, but the body is way too big -- i was swimming it in. i like it enough that i'm going to visit the tailor to take in the body. with the sale price, it is worth tailoring."
1,"This was an almost keeper I really liked the fit and feel of these pants except the bottom of the pant leg was more bell shaped than i wanted (bought white pilcro culottes last year and they weren't like this), but it wasn't a deal breaker. when i got home, i tried to pair the chocolate pants with something to wear in the summer, but it wasn't working for me. i think the color was just too dark and fall-feeling. they do run big, so i'd think about sizing down ... definitely worth giving them a try if you're okay with the"
1,"Love these pants! These pants are so cute and flattering. the linen is substantial and the quality of the tailoring is very good. i typically wear a 26p, but they were sold out in the gray color, so i tried the 25p and they fit perfectly. this tells me that they run just a little big, at least in the petite sizing. i wish the rose color was available in petite. i am considering ordering the chocolate as well."
0," #childsize. not sure where this went wrong but it's going back immediately. always wear a 0-2 in retailerpologist skirts, this size 0 runs at least two sizes too small. the material is beautiful, but if i got the size i needed i would be entirely swallowed by fabric. so disappointing."
1,"Great, versatile piece A great addition to any wardrobe. can go with nice trousers and dressier shoes for work or jeans and trainers for a casual look. i didn't find it to run small and indeed thought it fit as i'd expect."
1,Great pants! These pants are great. the pattern is beautiful and the fit is perfect. they pair well with a s front tucked shirt or fitted colwyn neck sweater. another great find from retailer!
0,"Not as pictured I loved the look of these pants in the pictures online and i loved the way that they fit. however when i got my pair, the flower placement was completely different. the whole front was black and there were just flowers running out of the crotch seams. i ordered another pair hoping they were just cut wrong, but those were even worse. they looked obscene."
0," I carry my weight on my lower half, usually a large in bottoms. this one in a large was too big throughout especially since it doesn't have a waste band. returned."
1, Gorgeous!! get these while you can. tts. has a lot of stretch. these are so much fun and will sell out! so happy!
1,"Warm and soft, but stretchy I received these as a christmas gift. they are really cozy: warm, soft and super comfortable. however, they stretch out a lot, as there is no drawstring or elastic on the waist band. this leads them to poof out a lot and i have to keep pulling them up. this is fine for hanging out around the house, but not if you want to wear them out and about. i'm keeping them because they're so comfortable, but beware how much they stretch. (i am 5'6"", 130 lbs and the size small fits well)."
1,"So flattering! I love this slip.. i am contemplating whether i can pass it off as a dress over the summer. the skirt is a subtle shinier grey than the top. it is flattering with or without a bra and i am not usually the type to go without. i am 5'3, 32c and the xs fits perfectly! also i think it looks better in person."
0,"Too big and baggy I love the fabric and design of these leggings, but unfortunately they ran way to big up top. they literally fall down."
0,"Not for average height women I am 5' and 3/4"" tall. too ""tall"" for most petite pants and too short for regular pants. these ran a little big. i weigh @140 lbs. and have been wearing mostly 28s and 29s, which is what i ordered. the 29s were a tad too big around the waist. the 28 fit but were so long that they looked like clown pants on me. i am in the conundrum that i can never find cropped pants that fit because i am in between petite and regular height sizing. these were a perfect example. they both went back. loved the qu"
1," Loved the chocolate ones so much, i went back for the rose. my first thought when i tried them on was, ""i could live in these!"" honestly a very comfortable pant."
0,"So small, so sad. I have quite a few pairs of retailer pants and jeans. my favorites are the cords i got last year, similar to these, so when i saw this fun pair, i had to have them. i ordered both the 32 and the 33 to try on.

they are even more beautiful in person than online. and they are so, so small. it wasn't like they were a tad snug--i couldn't even get the button across to meet the buttonhole. on the 33.

i've never had a problem fitting into retailer pants before. this was an extra-depressing first time"
1,"Simply beautiful I purchased this skirt on a whim as an option for the up and coming hoiday party season and was plesantly surprised. it is very well made,a medium weight taffita material, and best of all, it has pockets! i just love the combination of colors in the skirt; navy blue, grey, and ecru stripe. i paired the skirt with a taylored white dress shirt and statement necklace for a classic look but also imagine it combined with a dressy t-shirt cut as well. buy it while you can!"
1,"Goes with everything! I love this top. i got it thinking i'd wear it mostly with jeans but turns out i have worn it with a lot more. it pairs great with cut-off shorts, white jeans, denim jeans. i have worn it tucked in with high waisted jeans for a more polished look and also un-tucked for a more casual look. i get lots of compliments on this top when i wear it. i think it could be worn into fall with a jacket over it. very happy with it!"
1,Great summer top This top is a great addition to your summer wardrobe! it looks great with jeans/jean shorts. it's relaxed and comfortable with a super flattering cut. the straps and low cut in the back add a touch of sexy as well.
1,"Love the rose color! I really was uncertain when ordering these because linen can be difficult. these are actually very flowy and soft. i do think they run a bit large. the petite sizes sold out so i ordered a regular 27. it stretched out a bit too much by the end of the day. if that's the case, you need to be careful because the hook and tiny belt are going to struggle to keep up. you should consider ordering down if you are in between sizes. otherwise, the rose color is beautiful, accurate to the website, and work"
0,"Slip pass this one A truly unwearable slip: scratchy fabric, bunchy skirt, teeny bodice. it feels like you are wearing wrapping paper--the foil kind."
1,"Amazing culottes I tried these on in store and purchased them in the chocolate brown as the fit was perfect! i am 5' 8"" and weigh 145 pounds with an approximate 10"" difference between hips and waist. the size 27 fit perfectly. i was surprised that they did not wrinkle terribly as they are linen. they withstood wear during a very active day and still looked great by evening. they wash well and only needed a quick touch up with the iron. i liked them so well that i ordered a second pair in grey!"
1,"Comfy and unique with some minor design flaws This is my 4th pair of these printed cords and they are beautiful- the color says navy but these are definitely black with a grayish print. very stretchy all over except for the waist band which is a little uncomfortable but it might loosen up some. i wish the rise on these was a little higher. also worth noting is that the design on larger sizes won't look exactly like the picture- my size 33's have the floral scroll print up the front and the back, but also the cut has the scroll print running"
0,"Poor fit! So wanted great pair of sweater leggings...great for running errands and keeping the outfit simple. these are not that. these fit very poorly...i ordered the small, which is more like a large one in the waistline...there is nothing to hold these up and i could fit two of me in them. unfortunately, i thought all would be fine and i discarded the receipt and have worn them a few times~"
0,"Get these if you want to run around bare-bottomed! I am so sad i have to return these leggings. they're adorable--so much so that my fianc茫漏 commented favorably on them--but as other reviewers have pointed out, there's no elastic or string in the waistband so you have to walk around holding them up with one hand or they'll fall down! why, sleeping on snow? whyyyyyyyyyyy? they're so great otherwise!"
0,"Wanted to love This would have been a perfect jacket for a trip i'm taking, light weight and very stylish. however the jacket runs huge, the arms are long but it was the shoulders that were too big. i wear a size 8-10 mostly 10 in retailer clothes i ordered the large and the shoulder seam was about 2? past my natural shoulders. i won't return for a smaller size because the fabric being wool (i should have checked) its unbearably itchy esp around the neck, you could wear a long sleeve top and a scarf but then it"
0,"Cute, but not the length advertised I am 5' 10"" 135 lbs, normally a size 4l and ordered both a small in the navy and a medium in the beige. the elastic waist on both is not a tight/ muffin-top producing elastic like on some thinner banded leggings. in fact, the elastic is very loose, not very stretchy on either of the sizes. i think the s had been previously tried on, given the state of the packaging and the fact that the seat of the pant was already a bit stretched out. the m is definitely too large so i would say that these run"
1,Great quality I love these pants - they are very soft but the linen is thick and high-quality.
1,"Talk about creature comforts! This is a beautifully designed jacket that everyone will love and won't want to take off! i went with the gray wool. i always worry about jackets that are too snug, as i am busty, but this fit is superb. the arms are unusually long (though maybe this is good for you). i had a dressmaker shorten my sleeves by one inch, so now it's perfect for me. i bought the regular medium, my usual size (size 8 or medium top, 34f). i tend to wear my blazers and jackets open, but it's nice to know that i can but"
0,Constricting I tried on this top and it looked fine until i tried to move. you can't lift your arms. i tried on a larger size but still felt like the movement was limited in the back and arm areas.
1,"Beautiful This sweater is gorgeous - the colors are beautiful and the piece itself is soft. i do think it is a bit shorter than i would prefer, and i tend to wear petites. the sweater is nice enough that i do not mind!"
1,"Nice warm tights These tights have a nice pattern and color. they look just like the photograph. they are warm and because they are warm they have wool in them and they are a little itchy. but, that's the price you pay for warmth. i own several pairs of retailer tights and love the patterns (foxes, scotty dogs, and now trees). ."
0,"Weird construction I liked the design and i didn't mind that is see through, but i couldn't put it on ! not size 8 what is my usual size , not size 10 or 12, even 14! my shoulders wouldn't go through the middle part and it is not stretchy , so disappointed. i really wanted to like it."
1,"Great cut Love this blouse. it has great coverage but is very light (yes it is a bit sheer, but with a nude bra you can't tell at all), so it's great for needing to look professional on hot summer days. the structure at the bust/waist creates a very flattering shape, and i love the bronze gold buttons with the black pattern. i got a 2 (usually a 0 but every once in a while i need to size up) and could've possibly gone with a 0, but am happy with the freedom of movement i have with the arms with the 2. ove"
1,"Soft, lovely colors, great vibe Love this top! it has a great retro vibe, and the colors are great. it is very soft and great quality! i was in between a size xs and small. i went with the small, and wish i had gone with the xs. i would definitely recommend this top!"
1,"Warm and cozy Warm and cozy tights for my daughter, she loves them!"
1,Order a size down I know what you're thinking- the review below this says 'runs small.' not true. i am a size 4 fitted top and ordered a size small at first. it arrived and was really boxy and so big it wasn't flattering in any way. i ordered the xsmall because i really wanted this top to work. the fabric quality is amazing. so soft and strong! the xsmall is definitely a better fit but the cut is still a little boxy by nature. it's an excellent high quality chambray shirt if you're in the market!
1, I love this unique shirt!  the only thing is is is really wide like a babydoll top fit.  i tucked mine into skinny jeans
1,"Pretty, comnfortable and loose-fit I ordered the xx petite on this one, and unlike last year's version of a similar sweater, this one is a bit longer and looser. last year, i kept the xs p, but it was shorter too. the fit is loose, not snug or form-fitting, even as the smallest size available, it was loose but not large or unflattering. the length was also appropriate. love the colors, and pattern too. the material is soft, and the button detail in the back is fun. i am 30dd, 26.5 in waist, 115 lbs, for reference."
0,"Cute design, itchy material Love the design with the buttons down the back but unfortunately this did not work for me. the colors were brighter than shown on the website which was my first disappointment, i prefer more muted colors. the second disappointment was the material. for me it was just too itchy. unfortunately, this one's going back."
0,"Not flattering I felt like this shirt cut me in the strangest way. the waistband is very fitted, but there is so much extra fabric above and below it that it poofs out like crazy and made me look like a had a droopy chest and wider hips. it's also see through. 

fit is tts."
1,Love Love everything about this sweater. i usually wear xs in most retailer tops but had to exchange for a s. hope this helps!
1,"Favorite top! This is my favorite top! it is gorgeous, soft, & oh so comfortable. it's not too tight & works with leggings, jeans, or as an over-shirt. love it!"
1,"Size up! According to the sizing chart i should be an 8 or 10. i ordered a 10, but i could not get the blouse zipped up around the ribcage, the one spot i don't keep any fat. i brought it to the store to exchange for a 12, but i couldn't breath with the 12 on. for reference i am 34ddd. it was the 34 part that didn't fit, the ddd would have fit fine, i think."
1," The reviews are accurate that have already been said about the material and size. i usually wear a size 2 and i bought a size 4. it fits perfectly. the blouse is very sheer, but if you wear a neutral colored bra, it should be fine. i like the flow and cut of this blouse"
1,"Adorable!!! This sweater came in just as expected . . . adorable. as others have said, it is soft and comfy. i will wear it everywhere (including work). i love it! :)"
0, This shirt looks nothing like the fit in the pictures. it is short and very wide. i had read the previous reviews and thought i could take it in on the sides some but it is literally the shape of a trapezoid.
0,"Boxy and runs huge I bought this shirt immediately because of the pattern, when it arrived i was super confused. it's not a tee shirt like it looks like in the photos. it's made with cotton fabric with a tiny bit of stretch. i ordered the xl because i have brought shoulders and 36e bras size and it fits like a 2x or larger. i would say order two sizes down. also it hangs like a maternity shirt. i might order it once it's on sale, which it definitely will be, but even then am not positive i would keep it."
1,"Great detail work The liatris floral top is a comfy sweater knit with floral accents on the front and sleeves. the back has a row of buttons though the top easily slips on over one's head. it contains wool but is not in the least itchy. in fact it has a silky feel to it in its finely knitted fabric . it would be cute with a patterned bottom, like a plaid or dotted pants as shown. doesn't seem to be easy to snag."
1, I ordered this in a petite online and i usually wear petites.  it isn't see thru in a way that shows a lot and i love the light weight fabric.  i get a lot of compliments on it.
1,"Great I love this. it is perfect. it is sheer, but i wear a black cami underneath and it looks great. so glad antro finally has something with a waist! the small metal buttons are a really nice added detail. i wish you would make more tops with a defined waist like this one!"
0,"Cute but not cute enough This blouse is a disappointment! it runs so large, it looks ridiculous. the cute is super wide and flared. they must have it pinned on the model. it is not flattering at all. i really thought this could be cute. not worth the money either! it's expensive and ill-fitting. for reference i am 5'3 and 123lbs and wear a 2 or 4."
1,"Beautiful sweater I was excited to see this sweater in my local store. i have been coveting it online. it was just as pretty in person as i hoped it would be. 
the color is vivid and beautiful. i loved the buttons down the back. 
i usually wear a size small but they only had an extra small. i tried it on and liked the way it fit. i wanted a snugger look. i think the small would have worked too, just a looser feel.
the fabric is very soft. now just waiting for cooler weather so i can wear it."
1,"Narrow in the middle I love the look of this blouse and i like the light weight material. it would require a camisole underneath but could be worn at the office or a night out. i purchased a size 4 and it fit perfect once i was able to get it on so i wouldn't want a larger size but because it doesn't button down all the way and it's so fitted in the waist it was nearly impossible to get it on and off over my shoulders, there's no give at all. sadly i'm going to have to return it."
1, Just received my second pair of pilcro in the red. i loved the color and needed a back up pair. perfect fabric for year round wear. length is great for my height. love every pair i own. this is my 12th pair. love love them.
0,"Not for everyone The top looks like an oversized shirt in the model photo but as you can see it's not at all in person. made with what feels like hospital scrubs-meets-crisp-poplin, this shirt is stiff and does not lay flat against the body. the cut is almost triangular or bell shaped causing it to jut out - think of a flared wide leg pant - but as a shirt. the sleeves have a similar cut as well. i, too, am a 34c and found it made me look much wider as your bust will cause the shirt to move away from you. it's s"
1,"Pefect fit The structure makes this fit perfectly. the details are also lovely, and it is soft and well-made. it is a little sheer, but i felt comfortable enough to wear it with just a black bra underneath. if you are between sizes, i would probably size up."
1,"Very lovely The color is more like bluish-green, very elegant! it's very soft and feels great on skin. i love the buttons on the back, it's such a great touch and brings this sweater to a whole new level. 
i usually wear xs but because i'm going to wear this sweater with a button up shirt underneath, i ordered s. great investment! love to have it in my closet."
1,"Special I thought the design of this dress was distinctive, and it did not let me down. there is no zip so if your chesty like i am it may be a little difficult to get on, but i wouldn't sizes up because then it would be too big and balloony. i'm 5'5' and i got the petite which hit me about 2 inches above my knee. material is like jeans and consequently not see-through at all. even though it is quite expensive, there is something special about the dress."
1,"Adorable but tuck in style for me Great top, for me it would be tuck in only as a little wide near waistline. i am 5'4 so can do it with top length, but not sure someone taller could. so depends on wardrobe needs what you plan on wearing it with. would probably look cute with skinny jeans, but i bought it for skirts. adorable detailing around neckline and sleeves. really love it, but more sheer than i expected. great with a nude bra, but probably would see other colors through it."
1,"Spectacular! Super soft and cute. the buttons add a nice touch. the color depicted online gave me pause, but when i saw it in the store it was more of a blue than that what you see in pic. great investment. beautiful sweater. 34c, 65"", 135 and the small is perfect."
0,"Totally sheer This is completely see-through and i think it would look awkward with a cami underneath because of the highly structured shape. fairly cute fit, but not as a layering piece."
0," Sadly, this has to go back. i am 5'5"", 128 lbs and this shirt is super short on me. very short. and it's so wide it's almost a trapeze cut. the overall effect is 50s/60s style maternity shirt. which is disappointing because the fabric is beautiful, the detail is nice in person, even the sleeve cuffs are great. i am not very tall and i'm fairly thin on top so i can get away with a lot of styles, loose and tight. the combo of short and trapeze is just unflattering."
1,"Boxy sweater, cute dots. This a heavy cotton which is great for fall. design is cute and pockets are interesting. the fit is boxy and can look bulky. i only recommend if it's on sale."
1, Loved this top! it's an a-line shape which is very flattering. thick enough for winter with a coat but light enough for spring still.
1,Great fit I'm normally a 12/14 and ordered my normal size 32 which fit perfect. i purchased both the red and beige. the quality fit and color are great. i'm 5'9 and the regular length was fine.
0, It broke my heart to return this shirt. the pattern is just the kind of quirky that i crave from retailer. the quality is really great but in the end this shirt was just way to big. i don't think the xs would have made enough of a difference. sad face.
0,"Too short This is a beautiful sweater and a nice medium weight. however, it is an awkward length. i am tall and have a long torso so it's just not cut right for me and was not flattering."
1,Pretty darn adorable.......................... I see many uses for this sweater. it is so whimsical. i love it!
1,"Cute but short This sweater is super cute and i so wish it worked for me. i am but i must like sweaters a little longer than everyone else because this just hit me at the wrong place. if you're still trying to work off that last little bit of your baby bump, even 2 years removed, this hits right there and emphasizes your waist, at least on me and i'm 5'5"". it's so cute that i might have kept it to see if i could get it to work for me but it still has the ink tag on it so it has to be returned no matter what an"
1,Unique add for fall/winter I really like this sweater. i would suggest ordering a size up. i could had worn my normal size but a size up was much more comfortable. i have a burnt orange skirt that i wear with this and it makes the flowers pop.
1, If i stopped eating for a couple of months or jumped into a time machine and set the dial for 1990 i would really enjoy this beautifully made delicate blouse. the problem area is evident looking at the photo --the tiny tight fitted gorgeous bodice. i will keep this piece becasue i love it so and the apocolypse is apparently imminent and i have hardly any food in the house.
1," I ordered this sweater in a s and i am happy with the sizing. i am 5'6"" 130 and athletic build, it is not a long sweater and looks just like the sweater on the model. i typically like longer sweaters but this will look great with a pair of flare jeans and a nice belt."
0," Just a warning. i am always a 6 or 8 and even the 8 was so tight in the waist i could barely out this on. if you don't have a super tiny upper waist, this won't fit well. too bad, because it's super cute, if a bit sheer."
1,"Nice shorts - love the tie front! I purchased these shorts in a size 24. i'm on the petite side of things and the shorts are a little big. the tie-front allows you to tighten the short. i actually think the photo does a good job showing this item. the color is a washed out gray and the shorts are not too ""short."" the fabric is light and this will be great for hotter days. i like them."
1,"Runs very small First comment about this piece is that it runs unbelievably small, which is not in line with most retailer pieces. i had to size up two sizes to get the size to close, on top of being busty. the material is thin and mildly see thru, but i think the shape it cute and it had a unique look to it with the tiny gold buttons and non-collar top. i decided to keep it."
1,"Beautiful dress! I tried this on in store after falling in love with it on the rack. the dress is beautifully designed and has elegant, subtle features. i am normally a 2-4 in retailer dresses, but the 0 was the closest fit on me. unfortunately, this dress fit very strangely. the waist on the dress was way above my actual waist, which was unusual given i have a very short torso. it also had a strange fold right around my belly button, which was very distracting. i'll put this all down to my extremely straight and"
1,Love it! Tried this lovely navy dress on in the store in a size 6 and it was perfect. wish there had been a petite available to try since the hem fell below the knees on me and it would have to be hemmed. the crisscross on the front is very flattering to the waistline and i love the see through fabric along the shoulders and back. it's stretchy too!
1,"Super score This is such a great work wear piece for me. it's form flattering, well constructed, comfortable and truly elegant. this is probably my 5th or 6th dress from the moulinette soeurs line and i am consistently impressed with the quality and wearability of these clothes.

5'7"" 127lbs 34b wearing a size 4"
1,Perfect cocktail dress This dress is perfect. it's ridiculously soft (i felt like i was wearing pajamas) and it fits perfectly. the quality is great; well worth your purchase.
1,"So flattering This dress fits beautifully. the fabric is thick enough to feel significant and not flimsy, but the dress doesn't feel heavy at all. the detail is gorgeous, but still subtle. it's a little too nice for me to wear to work, but the perfect special occasion or party dress"
1," This dress is amazing! i bought this dress for my daughter for her college graduation. it fits like a dream. she normally wears a size 2 but i got the 4 which was perfect. with the slightly longer length, it is very professional but with the lace cut outs is great for a party, as well. it is very flattering and well made."
1,"Petite ladies avoid! I fell in love with this dress in the store and have been so excited to receive my size in the mail, but the proportions are all off! even the petite size is too long in the torso, and the regular is laughable for anyone that isn't an amazon princess. and i'm not even that short (5'4"")!

curvy ladies, also keep in mind that though the rest of the dress stretches nicely, the grosgrain ribbon detailing in the midsection does not, and will cut into any extra flesh hiding out on those hips. i would"
0,"Design great; fabric terrible I really wanted to like this dress. the color is perfect, the design and cut are cut (not always the case at retailer). however, the fabric quality was terrible - a shiny acrylic with cheap nylon lace. it looked like something from a discount store and had to go back."
1,"Better than i even thought! Boy is this a winner. the fabric has quite a bit of stretch, so it is form fitting but with enough structure that it doesn't make you bulge out in weird places. i can wear it with a blazer as a (admittedly dressy) day-to-evening look, and i can tell i'm going to get a lot of mileage out of it for the season's holiday parties. i am bigger on bottom than on top, and sometimes that can end up with weird bagginess around the bust for me, but not with this dress. i'm tall #5'8) and so the length is g"
1," Great dress. wonderful on hourglass and skinny straight shaped girls.
love the color combination and fit."
1,"Great dress Love the fabric and design of this dress, very unique and comfortable. it is not lined, which explains the lower price when compared to other well fashioned dresses. i wore it successfully with stockings and no slip and it did not ride up or cling strangely. the fabric is stretchy and form fitting without feeling tight. the ribbons that define the detail around the waist were a bit snug but we're not uncomfortable. they define the waist very well. i am 5'7'',127lbs, athletic build and the 4 fit"
1,"Beautiful I can wear this to work or dress it up as a cocktail dress. the fit is great, and the quality is very high. am usually a 2 or a 4, depending on the dress, and the 2 worked better in this one, so if you are between sizes, i would size down."
1,"Versatile dress you will wear over and over again! I cannot say how much i love this dress. i purchased it in mid-november and i'm wearing it for the 4th time this evening, which prompted me to write a review. it fits tts. the stomach area is slightly unforgiving, but due to the dark color, it's not at all a deal breaker. plus, it's a great dress to wear with opaque tights, which solve the tummy issues as well. what i love most about this dress is its ability to go from day to night/less formal to more formal. it looks great with edgy black ankl"
1,"Loved it so much i bought it in the wrong size So, when i first found this dress it was already on sale and sold out in petites. for reference i am 5'2"" and currently weighing in at about 108, and my bust is a 32d. the store near my work has a petite shop (thank goodness) so i headed there after my day. they didn't have it in my size but they did have the regular sizing in a 0, which i promptly purchased.

the crossed part sits a little higher than my natural waist, but i think for someone with a slightly smaller chest it would hit spot on."
1,"Basic shorts, cute pattern! Comfortable shorts. thinner fabric. pattern disguises underwear lines. love the exterior pockets, as i won't have to tuck them in when i zip up. as the previous reviewer said, the black and white pattern has blue accents. they're mid-rise and a longer length, which i appreciate."
1," I am very petite (5', 96-100 lbs) and find this to be pretty formfitting (not in a bad way) - a rare feat for petites! it is very comfortable - soft, sweater-like material and texture, which does make the dress feel slightly cheap to me, but it doesn't make it look cheap. it's also beautifully patterned in person, pretty true to the online photo, with the only difference being the dress is darker in person, so i don't feel the blue stands out as much as it does on the online photo. the length is"
1,"Summer time shorts These shipped fast!!! the fit is good. these shorts have some stretch to them, which is nice. there is a green/blue color in the fine detail making them versatile with a few different colors of tops. true to size. the length is perfect for my taste. i am 5'7""."
1,"Super cute If i saw this online i would never have glanced at the picture twice. instead, i came across it at the store and immediately snatched it up to try on. the green is very spring-y and rich while the raised little dots give it a lovely texture overall. really adorable on and fits fine in the regular although i am usually petite."
0,"Welcome back 1994 I thought this was so cute online, sweet and feminine, but when it arrived and i tried it on in my usual 12p i felt like i had just stepped back into freshman year of highschool - it is very early 90s - not the bohemian i was going for. it is also very high waisted, even for my little 5'1 frame. i truly felt like they pulled this out of someone's closet, dusted it off and said, ta da! as much as i love rachel and monica i have moved on from their clothing :)"
1,Love it! I am in love with this top. i was a little nervous because i'm on the bustier side (34d/dd) but it works for me so i say give it a shot--you never know. i'm hoping for more tops like this in the fall line.
1,"Wait for a sale At first i was interested. i liked the color, the soft tencel fabric, the cut in the back. it was all good. they didn't have my size in the store so i had to order it. when it arrived in the mail it was folded up and wrinkled. i tried it on and it looked like a lifeless unstructured blazer. i sent it back. 
all in all, it is cute and fun for warm weather. it is definitely a casual blazer. i'd probably wait for a sale on this one.
it does run tts."
1,Perfect accent piece Love this piece. it is warm and attractive and will set any outfit off from a dress to jeans and a t-shirt. i look forward to wearing it often.
1,"Cute top for all ages Fits true to size! looks great just wish it was a tad longer but i am 5'10"" so..."
1,"Really soft, great jacket. not navy blue Tried it on in store, it's more of a cornflower blue instead of a true navy. if you zoom in you'll also notice there's a pattern to it. i think it gives it a little something extra. i may put gold buttons on it as the plain black buttons are a little boring. 

 didn't buy it right away and came back with a survey coupon and it was out of stock. had them order and free-ship it to me from the store. 

fit is nice and relaxed. i like how it goes up in the back so it pairs well with dresses and"
0,"Not for busty ladies I love vintage lace so i was very excited to try on this dress. unfortunately, it just didn't work for me. i'm a larger, busty lady (size 14) and i tried on the xl. it fit fine, but did absolutely nothing for my figure. it just kind of hung on me. even with the belt tie i still feel like it didn't accentuate my waist line. i think this is better for someone with a straighter figure."
1," Very fun shirt. is see through beyond lace so need to wear black tank or black bra. very comfy, flirty and feminine. tts. flowy fit like on model."
1,Island blue off the shoulder top What a flattering top! great with jeans or shorts. i'm a sz12 and l was perfect for me. love the colors - got lots of comments.
1,I like it Finally saw this dress online. i have to say that it looks better in person. the model might be too tall for this dress. i am 5'4''. it's right to my ankle. the color is in a nice off white. the material is a good quality. the overall cut is nice. it's a kind of classic feeling.you could wear it for a long time without going out of style.
1,"Fun and easy I was going to re-turn this.top  i was really on the fence.  so glad i didn't, it is.comfortable and easy to wear. lace is a little restrictive, but willing  to over look  it because i look so cute"
1,Print may not be symmetrical as pictured I like these pants. they fit nice but they are sheer which is not a problem for me. my only issue was that the print is not symmetrical as shown in the picture. the print is what drew me to these pants. the pattern is all over the place in the ones i received. they are nice so i will keep them at the sale price but i don't think they would be worth it at full price.
1," This white blouse is absolutely stunning in person. i wore it with a nude strapless bra. note to self: remove makeup before blouse, otherwise it's all over your blouse."
0,Nice top for flat chested This top has nice quality lace but the layout is strange! it wouldn't stay under my boobs but kept creeping up and looked strange! not for girls with a chest!
1,"See-through These are soft, silky, and super comfortable, the fit is very flattering, especially with muscular legs. beautiful pattern and colors, fit like a glove. however, unfortunately, they felt like pj pants, i know they are beach pants, but they were pretty see-through. for the price, i decided to return and wait for potential sale... 
ps i needed heels as they are long if you usually get petite."
1,"Cute and nice colors I tried this one and actually liked it more on me when the shoulders were slightly covered, so i decided to leave it back as it would bug me eventually... but the style is very feminine and the colors are gorgeous... if you like off the shoulder look, i say definitely worth it. the fabric was soft enough too.

the xs (or 0) was great (regular size) for 115 lbs, 30 dd."
1,"Great jacket!!! Cannot believe this is still available and on sale. am 5' 6 1/2"", 150lbs, size 12 is perfect. this jacket goes with everything i try it with. it is silky smooth but still has structure. is a softer blue than navy. i love it! this is an absolute steal on sale."
1,"Beautiful blouse! This is a gorgeous blouse. the quality is on point. i was so disappointed because i had to return it.
the blouse was just a few inches too tight across the bust."
1,Beautiful top I loved this top from first sight and finally bought it this week. i am usually a six or a small. the small was so tight on the top that the ruffle rolled up across my chest. i ended up with a medium.
0,"Not for the busty of us! What a huge disappointment! i was really looking forward to wearing this top but it is very tight and awkward around the bust. if you have any semblance of a chest, this is not for you! i am a 38c and this was a no go. the quality of the top seems to be top notch but the fit was just no. it felt restrictive and it was hard to even move my arms and i have slender arms."
0,"Dress can't be cleaned Retailer has incredible service, and so they let me return this dress even after having worn it. however, this dress cannot be cleaned. i saw a stain on it after the first use, so i first tried hand washing it. however, the black part of the dress came off on the white part, making the stain worse. i then tried dry cleaning it (the care tag allows both) and that produced 3 or 4 new stains where the black rubbed off on the white. it's a beautiful, striking dress (that would be great maternit"
1,"It really is true to size Beautiful blouse - my only complaint is that the lace is too open for my taste. i'm a size small or a 4 for the most part. in retailer i can sometimes wear an xs. i decided to keep the small. yes, it's slightly restricting but i don't notice it much - it's definitely not a straight jacket. i also ordered a medium and in a way it could have worked but there was a lot of extra fabric. i am not flat chested - i wear a 34c - 32d depending on the bra. if you are inbetween sizes like me go with the larg"
1,"Wow I was looking for a cute going out top that was age-appropriate (40yo). i read other reviews that it ran large so i got xxs regular (xs not available) for reference, i am 5'2"" and 95 pounds but semi-broad in the shoulders.

i was wary of the poly fabric but it is surprisngly nice and drapes well- easy care for sure. doesn't look cheap at all. when worn on the shoulders, the elastic is tightish, but maybe i could have gone to xs if they had it but at least i know the xxs won't fall/slide.

1,Beautiful! I love this top! super soft fabric and beautiful with jeans. getting ready to retire and will make this a regular in my new wardrobe! thanks retailer for putting it on sale!
1,"Beautiful but an usual fit This top is beautiful. the cutout portion extends below the bust, but is intricate enough to look good with a black bra or exciting with, say, a taupe or grey one. the fit across the shoulders is snug, but the rest of the top is very voluminous. don't expect to tuck this swamp thing in. it's a bit of an odd contrast, but if you're prepared to wear something that is itself a beautiful object, even if it doesn't really make sense for a human body... this is it."
1,"Excellent dark wash jean Color is very nice and dark, with just a little fading around the knee. i sized down to 25 from my usual 26-27 (5.4' 120 lb)."
1,"Strange shape I'm not really sure what the designer was trying to accomplish with this dress. the fabrics and details are pretty but the shape is really strange. for one thing, the dress has a very straight cut so there is not a lot of room for movement and the thin belt makes the shape even worse. i felt like i was wearing a really fancy garbage bag. also, the way the bottom flares out is just strange considering the cut and length. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it was a complete miss"
1,"Can't love enough This vest goes with literally everything. it is the perfect amount of added warmth - though it's a bit hard to fit under a coat. the only thing i will say negatively about it is that it seems to shed on the inside a bit... but otherwise the quality, color, and length are perfect. and i love the pockets!"
1,"Soft well done design Dress runs a little small, tight on top. so i had to exchange from a size 8 to a size 10. originally ordered a petite but petite wasnt available in the 10 so i will probably have to get altered for an extra expense. the material is light and soft, flowers are muted. maybe would of prefered a little sleeve but design is so cute."
1,"Pretty lace detail I consider myself fairly busty (34 d), but i didn't have any problems wearing my normal size small/medium.....i actually went with the small. the lace inset doesn't give, but it wasn't tight at all. i love the flow of the blouse....it is going to be a great transitional piece into fall!"
1,"Love!!! Unlike other reviews i find this top to run true to size. for reference i'm 5'3, 117 lbs, 34 b cup, and took an xs. top fits comfortably, no tightness around the chest, and sleeves' fullness isn't overwhelming. the lace is see through, so a cami is a must. top is of excellent quality and craftsmanship. i have not laundered it yet, so i can't comment on that. so happy with my purchase! a keeper for sure!!"
1,"Wonderful top, very unique Get this while you can. it will not last to hit the sales. it is a beautiful top, with very unique colors and pattern-reminds me of key west. it has a slight tent shape at the bottom, which is not how it appears to be, but the cut is very nice and well done. i wouldn't size down, as the armholes are not huge, and then it would be too tight. i will have to cut them about 1/2"" to not bug me, and i'm typically a med, which is the size i got. i could take the sides in about 1"" on each side, which is"
0,"Fits like a potato sack I bought a petite medium and the length was right, but it fit like a potato sack. it was quite comfortable, and didn't look completely terrible from the front, but from the side, it was terribly unflattering. when i tried it on my boyfriend saw it and said it looked like i was wearing a nightie. i don't do form-fitting clothing, but this was the exact opposite and flared out every which way. it's got to go back."
0,"Awful I have never written a review before, and i love retailer and shop here often. however, i am so unhappy with this shirt i wanted to share to save someone else money. it is such poor quality, it looks thick and flows in the photo, it is very thin and it itches so bad, i could hardly even stand to try it on when it came in the mail. i will deff be taking it back, and do not recommend it at all."
0,"Cute but.... The top falls nicely, great quality, the lace is beautiful. however, the sleeves are too wide and puffy. the top is voluminous and i wished it had more form fitting sleeves to balance this out. the top does not look flattering on me so i will be returning it."

1,"Best dress pant ever! These pants are amazing! i usually have a hard time finding ones to fit me due to my small size (5'1"" 100 lbs) but the 0 fit me perfectly. they are not too tight, just slim enough without clinging to you like a second skin. love the length , hits just above the ankle bone. versatile and comfortable. however, if i were any heavier, i cannot say these pants would work. i am fairly thin, in most cases i would size up."
1,"Looks good, casual Very interesting material.  the very subtle/light window pane pattern is perfect."
1,Pretty color This is an easy-going weekend piece. it wrinkles a bit easily but it's comfy and swingy. i was a little confused about how to wear the shirt due to the open lace pattern (nude bra or nude cami?) i'm still not sure if it's appropriate to wear without a cami
1,Perfect top I love this top in peach! i usually wear a size 8 and ended up buying the large because that was all they had in store. it fits well but loose. i usually front tuck it in. what i love the most about this top is the perfect way it slouches off your shoulders. very effortless but doesn't feel like it is falling off. a few other off the shoulder tops i tried are either falling off or rising up (and you constantly have to pull them down over your shoulders) due to elastic in the shoulder. this top h
1,"Green perfection! I'm so glad i found this gem in the store, as the online pic does this shirt no justice!  the green version is vibrant and adorable, and this shirt is lightweight, without being see-through.  for sizing reference: i'm 5'4"", 135 lbs, 34c and a size 6 petite.  i tried this in the store in a size 4 and an 8 (only sizes they had) and rushed home to order it online in a 6.  perfect fit, so i believe its true to size.  the little details...the buttons and stitching make this shirt such a winner!"
1,"Love it Classic dress with a twist with split colors. very comfortable without looking like a bag on. can be dressed up or down. i am 5'7"" 118 and bought th extra small. perfect fit for me. not form fitting but still has shape and style."
1,"Elegant but relaxed I fell in love with this dress from the moment i saw it on various mother's day weekend insta posts by retailer stores. i was worried that it would not be a great cut for me, as it's pretty straight up and down, and i wasn't sure the waist would hit at the right place, because i'm super high waisted and this didn't appear to be so. in truth, it isn't, and i'll be tying the ribbon (or wearing a slim belt) at a higher point than where was originally intended. however, what struck me was the ability"
1,"Cute but thin This is a cute dress, not real form fitting and made of a thin but comfortable jersey material. little see thru and kind of sexy though if you have cute lingerie."
1,"Beautiful dress! This dress is stunning. i have been stopped in the street by people asking where the dress is from. my only complaint is that it was very wrinkled when i bought it. initially i thought it was supposed to be that way, but after seeing the stock photos i realized it needed to be ironed. it took a long time to iron all of the wrinkles out, but it is totally worth it."
1,"Perfect summer top! I bought this top for my daughter. the colors are so vibrant and the design and feel of the top is flattering. this top can be worn with black pants for a night out with friends, or with jeans or shorts to hang out at the beach! my daughter loves it!"
1,"Gorgeous This shirt is nothing like the online pictures. it's a stunner in person. ended up with the black one though i was torn between it and the white. i would agree with some other reviewers that it has little to no give across the chest so i bought a l due to broad shoulders. the m fit like a glove and i was afraid it might tear if i raised arms or reached for something. not sure if a large busted girl would be comfortable. though i sized up, it didn't affect the way it hangs and it hangs beautifull"
1,"Makes me feel pretty I love this off the shoulder top. it is so flattering  and the  colors are gorgeous. i normally wear a small or medium in retailer tops, i am wearing an extra small in this one, and it fits great. i am only 5 1"" tall so the length hits me perfectly."
1,"Beautiful, unique dress! I was not sure about ordering this dress, but i'm glad i did! i love the cut and all the details...very unique! i am usually a 10 and the medium fits me perfectly. love, love! if you're on the fence about ordering this dress, i say go for it. for reference, i'm 5' 6"" and the hem hits me mid-calf."
1,"Love it... but size up! I love this top and was so happy when it came out in black! i'm typically an 8 on top and sized up to a 10, and it still feels slightly small across the shoulders and arms. it also requires a under tank because it's very sheer, even with the lining. worth it though!"
1,Very chic! This dress looks very good on me! it's a cute way to appear dressy without the extra work to look the part.
1,"Beautiful pants but runs small Unfortunately, i will need to exchange for a bigger size. i am 5""3"", 115 pounds. i normally wear a 2 or a 4. i ordered a 4 and they are a bit too tight. i am worried the 6 will be to big but love the pants enough to give that a try. excellent quality."
1,"Buy! Very flattering fit. a little billowy but i'm okay with that because it hides my stomach. have to wear a camisole underneath as you can see through the lacey parts. overall i love the shirt design, fabric and fit."
1,"Beautiful; blue looser than black. I bought this blouse in black in december of 2015. like other reviewers noted, it has a bit of an odd fit with the lace being a bit constrictive across the bust and raising arms. it wasn't a deal breaker because i loved the look of the blouse. however, i just purchased this blouse in the new color blue in july of 2016 and i'm happy to say the blue color is looser and i have no problems with the lace being constrictive around the bust or arms.

the blue blouse i just purchased is definitely l"
1,"Love I love this dress so much, very detailed and comfortable. looks great with the pilcro vest."
1,"Cute top Great top, cuter in person with details than looks in picture. i found it to be true to size though i was worried it might be too boxy and wide. it was great, very cute! i do mostly plan on tucking it in with skirts."
1,"Love love love Love, love, love this top. it is everything i hoped it would be. i liked that it could be worn up or off the shoulder. what made me fall in love were the colors. quality is excellent as usual. it is quite full in bodice, however it's only an xs. i do best with xxs tops."
1,"Not quite as pictured The comfort of this fabric is terrific. the swing-y style is easy to wear. however, i expected a black and white dress, which is how it looked on line. in person, the light portion of the dress is a marled oatmeal color. it is fine - just not what i expected.

if you are a fan of swing dresses, this is a great, casual choice."
1,"Awesome, stylish blazer I tied this on a whim, thinking it was a big 80s on the hanger, but it is so cute and hip, i fell instantly in love. the material is amazingly soft and generally doesn't wrinkle. i wore it for my thesis presentation and it went flawlessly! it has a very light light-grey window pane print on it that looks great with grey pixie pants, white pants, and the blue is light enough you could even pair it with black bottoms and jeans. a total catch, and the fun layover in the back is just an added pop of"
1,"A wardrobe essential You must have this vest for your fall/winter wardrobe. the design is extremely flattering to the female curves. i love the feminine ruffles. the pockets are a bonus. the vest is vegan-friendly. a hundred percent polyester! i normally wear a medium, but the small size fits me better. as an artist, i like to wear with my red plaid retailer shirt. hurry and get this vest before they are sold out. i'm sick i missed out on the museum district vest. all the smalls were sold out. i hope my experie"
1,"Very well made! Another keeper! this top is just beautiful, it is so well made. worn with a black cami, chunky necklace and skinny jeans-perfection. the back drapes longer in the back which i liked as well!"
1,"Stunning but has fit issues This top is beautiful, the lace is sturdy and intricate and the top drapes perfectly, slimming. but, a word to the wise, the lace does not stretch at all even though the rest of the material does and that coupled with where it is on the bust and back means very limited movement unless you are a size 0 with an narrow back/chest and shoulders. i can't imagine anyone with a cup size larger than a b wearing this. i am 5'5"", 145 lbs and a 34b and always a small or medium and a size 6 for reference. i"
0, Ditto to all of the reviews who state that this top is beautiful but runs small in the bust. i am a large or an xl so i ordered this in the xl. i'm a little broad and busty and it was too small/binding. this is a beautiful well made top for a certain body type.
1,Elegant but runs big Thank you to all of the reviewers who took the time to write a review. your reviews are what help me know exactly which size to order and how to know that i needed a regular instead of a petite. i'm 5'3 and typically wear a size 8 in retailer sizes. i went with a medium regular based on other reviews. thanks so much because the fit was perfect though still a little roomy.
0,"Very itchy I had to return this blouse because it ended up been too small and super itchy. im kind of busty but medium usually works and this one was super tight across my chest. not comfortable at all and the fabric is kind of a sheer with the sparkly lines in silver.
wouldn't recommend it."
0, Not what i expected. they ran very small and the fabric seemed cheap for the price. returned.
1,"Debating if i should keep it Since i could not find this jacket in the store, i ordered it online, and received it today. i would say it runs true to size to me. for reference, i am 5'2"", 120lbs, and size small fits fine. the material is a little bit on the thin side, it is not as thick as a typical denim jacket. i also found the color of the buttons to be different from the online images. the online images showed that the buttons are bronze/golden color, but the one i received comes with gunmetal colored buttons. i don't k"
1,"Comfortable and elegant dress This dress fits well and is comfortable. my only reflection is that i am 5'9"" and it hits at my mid shin, rather than where it appears on the model."
0,Poor quality The material is so thin and so itchy..like other reviewers stated..it itches so bad and feels like sandpaper..i thought it would be ok to wear a tank top underneath but sleeves are still itchy. otherwise the design is great and the long peplum hem is very pretty and would look great with skinny pants or leggings and boots
1,"Gorgeous!! I paired this beauty with the beacheress necklace and the result was stunning. the colorway in this top just makes my summer tan pop! i am 5'3""/36b/108 lbs and the xs fit perfectly. since it does run short there is no way that i would suggest anyone go with a petite unless they are under 5' and/or very short waisted! the fabric in the top drapes beautifully and i felt super feminine all evening...and got tons of compliments as well!"
1,"Love it so much i bought it twice! It's embarrassing to admit but i am buying this top for the second time because i've misplaced the first one and i fear that if i wait too long trying to recover it that it will be a sold out item and i'll never be able to have it again... hence the decision to repurchase. i just love it that much. i'm sure that now that i have the second top the first one will mysteriously show up, lol!

anyway, this top is a very flattering off the shoulder style. one of the things i really like about it is"
0,"Wish i could keep I wish i could keep this dress based on the pretty orange print and style but the fabric and details make this a return, even on sale price :( agree with previous reviews: bodice too tight, neckline too high/chokes, fabric is rough, outer is poorly attached to liner so it poofs in weird areas. too bad...so sad!"
0," Way too much fabric; sticks out like jodhpurs but from the hip - eek! might be a great dress in rayon or a drapey fabric, but the extra fabric just piles up on itself... the outer layer also doesn't feel like it will breath. add the cotton lining, and i think it will feel miserable in the heat of the texas summer. returning."
1,"Islander top A little boxy. a little short in the waist. a little overpriced. but, the shoulder ruffle and the color are so flattering and in the mirror it just says summertime casual chic and cute."
1,"Great color, fit was not flattering This shirt is such a pretty color i was so excited to get it... however i felt like the fit was not flattering. it sort of just hung on me. didn't do much for me. i actually ended up returning it."
1,Super cute blouse I love this blouse. the color is very cheerful with it's small white polka dot design. i usually wear a medium but went with the large because the shirt is slightly sheer and i will likely wear a cami underneath.
1,"Beautiful top It's funny because i coveted this top online for weeks, but looking at the reviews i kept thinking that it would look ridiculous on me. i am very busty and do not like things to cling or be too tight. however when i went into the store today i tried on both the cream and the black in larges, and both fit beautifully. i decided to go with the black just because i thought that i would get more use out of it. i find that it fits well, though perhaps the sleeves because of the elastic are a tad bit"
1,"Great jeans! The girls at the local retailer are big fans of coh, & i've been thinking maybe i shld try them out. i ordered these online in the size 29, as i am usually a 28/29 in skinnys. i am a little hard to please, or say hard to fit in skinny jeans. i like a snug good looking skinny but not so much if it's uncomfortable. paying full price it is expected for the look & fit to be perfect. even if on sale, i won't go it if i think something is not right for me. at 5'3"", 117#, slender legs, skinnys are either"
1,"Lacy & flowy I love the desi blouse! i got it in white and it's a little more off white than pure white, but it is a great flowy top. the touch of lace across the bust is a nice accent. the only down fall is that the sleeves are a bit puffy, but the rest of the top makes up for that."
1,"Love the turquoise graphic design I am usually a small sometimes medium. purchased a small and want to wear it off the shoulder but it is too tight and the fabric is scratchy. it is a crepe fabric and although beautiful the hand of the material is not for me.
confused if i should return or get a medium as the look is very cool.
i wish this had been linen or some more natural material but still recommend it as a good buy"
1,Feminine find This is such a cute top. i like it both off and on the shoulder. easily tucked or left out depending how you want to style it.
1,"Gorgeous and comfortable dress I tried this dress on in-store and fell in love with it as soon as i put it on. it's beautifully made, the fabric is soft, comfortable, and free-moving, and overall it has a lovely vintage, romantic look. i actually ended up wearing it for a family photo shoot the next week, and was pleased with how it looked in our photos as well, especially the lovely way the fabric draped. another reviewer said it seemed baggy and oddly-shaped; it does seem shapeless before you tie the waist tie, but once tha"
1,Really cute top This is a great looking top in person. i've worn this with jeans or skirts for different looks and it's cute both ways. i would order a size up though as it is not a flexible fabric so the shoulders/chest area need a little room to move comfortably.
1,"Beautiful , romantic I was hesitant to buy this because some reviews said that if you were busty it would fit tight and awkward across the chest.. i'm petite, 32c, 5ft and purchased the xsp in white .it is gorgeous! it fits a tiny bit big and i think i could have gotten away with a xxsp, but i like the flowiness of this size i have so i'm keeping it. it does not feel tight across the chest at all and hangs beautifully. i love it! the material is gorgeous and it is well made."
1," I am so glad i read the reviews for this before i purchased it. i am 5'5 and 135 pounds and normally wear a size 6 in dresses. i would normally buy a small, but sized down to an xs and it was perfect! it's a beautiful dress and very flattering!"
1,"Watermelon dream! This top is my new favorite. i thought it might have too much volume, but it does not. it is very flattering. the color looks just like the picture."
0,"Cute top, but... A very cute and comfy top that's lightweight and falls nicely... but, it does snag very easily. so far, i've worn this top once and found small snags in multiple areas. the snags might blend into the fabric texture if they did not create dark spots. the yarn/thread is a mixture of a celadon tone and black, which concentrates the black when snagged."
1, Had to send back for exchange. way too big. i'm very excited to get a smaller size because they are really beautifully made.
1,"Cute plaid top with a feminine cut I like the color and the plaid pattern on this top. the material is soft to the touch and despite being petite, i bought the regular length to pair with tights. it has the feel of a baby doll because of the longer length on me. i quite like the feminine cut of the top which makes it slightly unique as far as plaid tops go. the material also doesn't feel too flimsy or cheap and the top feels well made. it will not be hard to reach for this item as it is a versatile piece, as many reviewers have n"
0,"So long!! I am of average height, but these pants are so long!! i considered altering them because i like the print, but i don't think it's worth the effort for workout attire so they're going back. shame!!"
1,"Gorgeous dress This dress is really beautiful. i plan on wearing it to my nephew's wedding in april. my only complaint would be is that it runs extremely small. i am 5 feet tall and 90 pounds, slim build, and normally wear a 00p or 0p. i ended up with the 2p, and it fits perfectly. my advice to anyone considering purchasing is to order several different sizes and return the ones that don't fit."
0,Fabric pulls very easily! I bought these shorts last week in the cobalt blue color. they are super comfy and the color is beautiful however after wearing them for only a few hours i noticed a pull in the fabric that all the way down the front of the right leg. i'm extremely upset about this because they were relatively expensive for lounge shorts. i love the shorts otherwise.
1,"Great shirt! I love this shirt so much that i bought a second one even though they are exactly the same. the cut and the fit are free and easy, so comfortable and how many shirts are all cotton anymore? washes well, hang dry, easy to care for. i recommend this shirt for a casual look with style!"
1,"Beauttiful fabric I love these pants. the material is so nice and well made. i love the glittery threads within the pattern. the waistband is elastic which is good for me as my waistline fluctuates. these pants can be dressed up or down. the length was perfect and hit at my ankle (i'm 5'3). the only flaw is that i wish the pant leg was slimmer around the ankle. it would be a more flattering look. . 

one thing to note: if you have a big butt or do not like to emphasize that part of you, these are not the pants"
0,"Costs too much for low quality Not up to retailer standards! fabric quite thin(you could see nude-color bra through the white one) and thin fabric, wide bottom hung sloppy; no way i would feel ""well dressed"" in this top. i returned it."
1,"Great shorts I love these shorts. they're really comfortable and versatile. i got them on sale, and for the price they were a steal! the material is nice, and you can dress them up or down."
1,"Favorite new plaid I purchased this top during the 20% off sale and i'm very pleased with it. i love how flowy it is without looking like a maternity top. for reference, i'm 5'4, 130# and purchased a small (my usual retailer size). if you have broad shoulders you may have to size up as i found the arms and shoulders to run a little small."
0,"Off I am not in love with this top and will be returning it. from the front it looks like a basic tee (which i expected) but the back ""x"" is too loose and slumps to the side so that it doesn't look like an ""x"" as the picture shows. so basically the focal point of the tee falls short."
1,"Great hoodie! I loved this look! it's s great light hoodie to throw on. comfortable, nice color, and unique with the plaid later! i'm 5'3"" and the xs fit well."
1,"So beautiful I love these pants! they really make you look and feel classy. i also bought the feather tank and absolutely love this outfit! it is flattering, beautiful and oh so comfy! true to size,"
1,"Cute fall/holiday top Love this top! the quality is great and the pattern is even cuter in person. i'm 5'4"", 125 lbs and bought my normal size s which fits perfectly. it's pretty flouncy and roomy, which is nice because it hides my post-baby tummy. especially love how the back covers my bottom which means i can wear my skinny black leggings underneath. definitely recommend!"
1,Very cute This top is so pretty and feminine. i love how the design and quality of this top.
1,"Nice but neck dind't work for me I tried on the xs in store (would need xxs i think, it is short enough to not need petite). anyway, the neck part was really bunching up on me (between neck and girls), it wasn't flattering. the rest of the tank is really pretty and flattering though, but the bunching was enough for me to leave it behind. the fabric is soft, and the color is nice warm neutral. i love the lace back with the subtle layer of satiny looking fabric. overall goo, perhaps i don't have the right shoulder shape fr this."
0,"Another sheer shirt The white is completely sheer. i am so tired of see through shirts!! even at the sale on top of sale prices, i wouldn't recommend this shirt. if the fabric weren't sheer it would be a very comfy shirt with a cute back. but it just looks silly with a tank top under it, the cotton just doesn't lay right."
1, Very comfy and really nice fabric. can see myself wearing these a lot. i'm a size 12 and the fit was perfect.
1,Soft This is so soft and really cute. would be a good bathing suit cover- must wear a cami under it.
1,"Unique and pretty but kinda sheer I tried on this top in the ivory color in the store, but i didn't need another ivory-colored top, so i passed it up. however, i kept thinking about the pretty details, especially trim on the sleeves, so when i saw it online in the red color, i ordered it. i was surprised when it arrived with how thin and sheer the fabric is (the soft flowy mini-pleated body of the shirt; the other sections are flat cotton, which is more sturdy). i hadn't noticed this when i tried on the ivory version! but i'm ke"
1,Great top! I bought this top in black and love it! the crossed straps in the back give it a stylish twist. i also tried it in white and found it to be a little see thru.
1, These shorts are super comfy and the color is awesome!
1,"Cute and comfy Flattering fit and design, but the material is thin and they are semi-sheer. great for lounging and the beach! very comfy!"
0,"Cute style but poor quality I ordered this dress online. the previous reviews were accurate that it runs small, particularly in the waist. i normally wear a 0 or 2, but i ordered the 4. it fit my waist and hips but was slightly loose at the top even though i am a 34c. i liked the look, but it had a hole where the seams had come apart between the black stripe across the chest and the main fabric. additionally, the black squares were pulled in several places with threads sticking out. i returned it immediately."
1,"Love I bought these pants online in blue, and loved them so much that i bought them in the bronze two days later. very flattering fit, comfortable, great quality, and i look and feel like a class act wearing them. they're a bit of a looser taper style of fit, but that's just the style, and i've received so many compliments on them!"
1,Beautiful dress This dress looks amazing on. it fits your body like a glove and the zipper lies flat. the black out-lined neckline looks very sophisticated as does the pattern of the dress. my only issue is that the dress ran very small.
1,"Cute and comfy This is a heavier weight shirt. it is fitted through the bust and shoulders and very loose below so, if you don't like loose fitting clothes, this is not for you. it is well made and looks cute with jeans."
1,"Perfect for everyday I absolutely love this shirt. it's so easily dressed up and is still really cute just on top of black pants and flats. great for the holiday season too! i am normally a size medium in all tops, i am 5'8'', 150 lbs, athletic-built and the medium is perfect. true to size, definitely recommend!!"
0,"Runs large, too much fabric I thought this top would be a little more form fitting than it is. there is so much extra fabric near the bottom it is almost like a swing style top. the fabric will most definitely snag, as it is not a linen or cotton top material but rather a silky type and also very thin - not very good quality. i got the smallest size possible and it was absolutely huge, everywhere but the neck."
1,Love this top Tried this top on in store in a small and it was a bit snug in the chest (32dd) but loved it otherwise. the sales associate had it shipped to me in a medium and it is perfect!! a great length over leggings or skinny jeans and is lightweight enough for warmer days or can be layered with a tank underneath and a cropped cardigan for colder ones.
1,"Beautiful top Nice top. you can dress it up or down. runs very large, i had to exchange sizes twice. my regular top size is 10 but end up buying size 6."
1,"Cute and comfy style I was hoping not to like this tee so that i can be $48 richer (lol). it's very cute. i would say runs true, but more on the smaller side. i usually wear xs and it's a good cut for me. it's not boxy at all. i love the strap detail on this tee. i hope the quality will hold up. for reference i am 5'3 and 123lbs (2/4)."
1,Several issues I got this dress on line - i ordered several sizes after reading the reviews. it does run small. i usually wear a 2 in dresses and needed a 4. i love the fit and it is a beautiful dress - however the little black pin dots are easy to snag. i wore it once - didn't feel like i was wild that night - ha! - but when i took it off that night it had 3 places where it had snags - ugh!
0,Great style I loved the style and shape of the dress . it does run small. i had to return it because some of the black dots pulled and looked like it might be more of a problem as i wore it
1,"Beautiful but roomy These are lovely, dressy pants, but they act larger than they need to (even for the model above, see photos). i usually order size 8-10 in pants, and size 10 in these fit at the waist but felt bulky below, partly because of large pockets made of the same material. another detail to note: there is metallic thread running thru out the material, glinting more than the photos show. the golden vertical leaflets don't show as much, because of the overall shine. so i will return these lovelies, because"
1,"Comfy and flattering Tis is a soft, soft cotton shirt that is comfortable and cute. it's a great top to use put on and go. i'm looking forward to wearing it often!"
1,"Perfect This tee is versatile, soft, well made, and it washes/dries well. i love longer length and stripe pocket details. it runs true to size, and it is a beautiful dark navy blue. what more can i ask for?"
1,"Very cute! After reading other people's reviews, i was afraid it might be too long. i ordered the regular xs as all the petite a were sold out. i found the length to be perfect and i am only 5'2""."
1,Beautiful! Love all things mes demoiselles and these do not disappoint! the gold does not show in the picture but they sure do sparkle...in a great way. the fabric is rich and can be worn all year as they are light weight for summer but carry a look perfect with sweaters. i love them and with the sale on sale they were a steal and happy to have them...they will be that one piece that i will grab again and again. i love the look of peasant blouses and shorter vests...in a contrast print would be incredible
0,"Gorgous design, poor fit This suit is absolutely gorgeous but it really will only fit a very short waisted gal. it fit perfectly in the body and in the bust but just was not long enough for me to lift my arms up and my size c cup boobs to not pop out. i was very sad to return it :( i am a size 8 with c cup boobs and ordered it in a medium"
1,Love it! Love this top. great twist on a traditional plaid. looks great with skinny jeans or leggings. i get compliments on it every time i wear it.
1,"Nice looking but stiff material These pants are attractive but their material is stiff and feels like canvas. i like them, but am not sure that i ""love"" them. perhaps they will get softer with wear, but only time will tell."
0,"Nice, but too long I loved the rich navy blue color with the accent pockets. the fabric was a nice weight, not too thin like lots of retailer tops. i liked the top from the front, however the back was way too long, especially with the looseness of the style. it would have been much better if it were not so much longer in the back and maybe a little more fitted. it might work on someone taller. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs. and i tried xs."
1,"Super soft Super light and soft. haven't worn it out but expect to wear with jeans. it will be cute and comfy. i'm 5'2"", 130 lbs and bought a small, fits well."
1,"Not too sheer, but it is too long I bought this shirt in white and am happy with the fact that it's not too sheer. the back detail is great. my only complaint is that it is too long. i got the small and it fits nicely in the arms and top, but it is much longer on me than on the model. i'm 5'5"" tall. it doesn't look great when i do a half tuck, but it looks fine if i tuck it all the way in. maybe an xs would have been a better fit."
0,"Beautiful until washed I absolutely loved these pants the first several times i wore them. the fit is flattering, they are a perfect long length, and the colors are stunning. after several wears, it was time to wash them and i followed the directions provided to wash with cold water and line dry. i was initially horrified with the amount that these pants shrunk in fit and length and the colors ran together. after a lengthy ironing session, i was able to smooth out the material and restore much of the length and fit bu"
1,"Great skinny pants I really liked these pants! they are so audrey hepburn. i especially like how they come up high on my waist. i actually bought 3 different pairs of ""essential"" pants and kept all of them. (essential taper and essential slim). i stated that these run small but they just seem to run smaller than the other two. i'm 5'3"" and they are a touch longer than i'd like but that is an easy fix. for reference, i'm 110 lbs and bought size 2 in these and 0 in the others"
0,"Cheesy... I agree with the other reviewer who stated this sweater is very ""80's""!! online it looks minorly fluffy with muted colors, but in person it's a bad overly-fuzzy christmas sweater with super bright 80's colors!! if you're going for kitschy / tacky / retro this may work for you, but if you are looking for the sweater in the photo you'll be disappointed... :( it looked to be true to size, but to be honest i hated it so much i didn't even try it on."
1,"Good pants I bought a pair in both black and green. i sized up one size because of previous reviews. i am happy with the fit. they are very comfortable, look good and keep their shape. the only negatives are after two washings, (following the directions-cold water, no dryer), the black has faded and the hook closure on one is difficult to close and the other was barely attached. overall, i would still recommend them."
1,"They shrink - but here's the fix! I love these pants - the color is great, the style is comfortable and easy but can be dressed up. like other reviewers, i washed these according to the care instructions and they shrunk horribly. however - after some googling, i was able to find a fix. soak the pants for 5-10 minutes in warm water mixed with 3-4 tsp hair conditioner. gently wring them out and start to (gently) stretch the fabric as much as possible. hang on a drying rack and continue to gently stretch the fabric as the pants dry"
1,Fabulous fit & feel So soft and comfortable ? i wish i'd bought the other colour too!
1,"Obsessed w/ag stevies I love that these are a nice thin stretchy material (not in a bad or cheap way) because they are perfect for the warm weather as well. i got the color grey in a size 29. i usually wear a 29 in stevie's so they were tts. maybe a bit tight in the beginning but they do stretch a little with wear. i did try on the size 30 but they were a little big around the waist. for reference i am 5'6"", 145lbs, size 6/m. the fit of stevies are perfect and hugs in all the right places. i have wider calves and it"
1,"The perfect black pants Thank you retailer! these really are the perfect black pants. great fit and construction. the material doesn't wrinkle, they slim and shape the body and they are at a good price point. i did have to go up one size but i especially love the elastic in the waistband. my local store almost sold out of these in a day."
1,Comfy yer dressy Love these jeans.

0,"Made poorly, but still kinda cute I really wanted to like this top. in fact, i have put it on to wear several times then opted for something else. so i'm thinking it has to go back. for one thing, the yoke part is sewn onto the bottom so the stripes are crooked...that bothers me. i may get it in the white instead because i do like the style. i just wish it were in a solid color. but try it - it might work for you!"
1, Runs a bit small. very slimming. love these. when will they be available in moss again?
0,"Fabric has a sheen These pants fit tts and are ask pictured in length on me (5'5""). i can go between a 4 and a 6, and tried the 6 and they were fine. that said, the fabric completed turned me off. it is that sort of stretch fabric with a sheen to it. i did not find them to be the wonderful wardrobe basic i thought they'd be- the fabric is just too stiff, and the sheen made them feel cheap, unfortunately."
1,"Unique detailing / boho Love this suit. i ordered up a size on the bottoms, and am so glad i did. the style fits true to size, is beautiful, and vibrant. i thought it looked like ribbing vertically, but it is just part of the design. it is not padded at all, but is thick enough to be seamless."
1,"Beautiful pants Tried one at the store. love the look and feel of this pants. so soft and flowy! sizing runs large. for reference, i'm 5'4"" and 115 lbs. xxsp fits just right. highly recommended!"
0,"Poor quality - seams split I purchased these pants while on vacation because i thought they'd be the perfect addition to my comfy travel wardrobe. on my second wear, i happened to be on a long-haul flight when the entire side seam split about a food long on my upper, outer thigh. luckily i'd packed a back-up dress. the pants weren't tight at all, but the seams wren't strong enough to handle a little pressure from sitting i guess. poor construction. i would not recommend these."
1,"Adorable casual top Love this top for spring - great with athletic leggings, regular leggings or jeans. it is a lot longer in the back, which i like as it covers my butt and makes leggings work-appropriate. great quality. true to size - i am 5'9"" and 128 lbs - xs fits perfectly. fabric is a little wrinkly but that is intentional. lighter material so it is good for spring weather, but sturdy enough not to be see through at all."
1,"Cute flowy tunic I'm a tunic girl--have to admit that. for me this top is fab.  i love roomy, swingy tops and this is exactly that. as others have mentioned, it is quite roomy at the bottom, however the weight of the fabric is so light it lays very nicely.  i love how it fits in the arms. i hate when arms are too big. the sleeve fits snugly. for reference i am 5'5"" 140 lbs. the small fit perfectly. i have already worn several times to work. perfect in the a/c."

Within 2 washings the color faded to a not so black black, like a pair of pants that has been washed over a year's use. after 5 or so washes the hook and eye closure began to fall off. the pants fit well, albeit a bit short (i'm 5'9"") and they run small. i sized up to a 6, when i usually am between a 2 or 4. i let the hem out, sewed the hook and eye closure back on and redyed them, and now they are good to go, but for nearly $90 i don't expect to have to do this much work. these are not my first"
1,Cute skinny cords I purchased these in white and love them! fit my muscular thighs fine.
1,"Great top! Love this top! it runs very true to size, is not too boxy, and looks great on my 5""1"" body (i bought a medium). i purchased the beige top first, then bought this one. great addition to my wardrobe."
0,"Disappointing For some reason, the cream colored cords are sheer. the material is quite thin. you can see the pockets through them, as well as the seams. i have other ag cords and it seems the material they are using this go around is substandard. too bad."
1,A little big I purchased these in large which is normally my size on bottom. they are a little roomy and the waist is so high on me that i am going to tack the waist down. they are ok. good quality but not the best pants in the world.
0," I loved these when i first got them. they fit perfectly and are the softest and most comfortable pair of cords i've ever owned. plus ag is the only brand of jeans i buy. unfortunately, they stretch out horribly within one wearing. for such a pricey pair of cords, i'm extremely disappointed. i'm not sure if i should've sized down, but now i'm wishing i had, although i'm not sure that would make a difference."
0," I loved these pants. the fit well and were flattering. unfortunately after three wears, they came apart at the seam. very disappointing and frustrating."
0,"Fabric too stiff These ran true to size, but the fabric is very stiff and unforgiving. i'm athletic and have lean legs, but these seemed to cling to and roll on every dimple on my thigh. and sitting down was uncomfortable at the knees because of the stiff fabric. i loved how they fit at the waist, but the legs just didn't work for me. sadly returning these."
1,Great tunic! This tunic is flowy without having too much material to make you look bigger.  i love the way it fits.  i'm 5'4 125 lbs and got a small.
0,"Pass on this one... Like previous reviewers have said, these run a bit small and i'm surprised no one's mentioned that these are very high rise. for reference, i'm 5'7"", 130 lbs, 34-27-37, and am an retailer size 4 in tops and pants. i really wanted to love these pants, but even after ordering a size up and trying on a 6, i was still not in love. and the other reviewers are right ? the back zipper is kinda hard to zip up. the top of these pants are exactly the same as the essential flares, so if you're thinking of ge"
0,"Loved at first but... I was so excited to finally find a work appropriate contemporary pant that i wore them about 3 times in the first week. needless to say they needed to be washed, and i followed the care instructions by washing in cold water and laying flat to dry. after just a single wash in cold water, the pants faded to the point that they looked like they were three years old. so sad, luckily retailer took them back without a problem. be warned, these may need to be dry cleaned which is a lot of maintena"
1,"Beautiful, unique jacket I was on the fence about ordering this jacket, but i'm so glad i did. i got my birthday discount to help afford it. as the first reviewer said, the weight is substantial, but not too heavy, and the embroidery is beautiful! i have not worn this jacket yet, but i expect to get many compliments when i do! i usually don't wear jackets in this style, so it's a fresh, new approach for me....the embroidery takes it to the next level! it fits true to size. i usually take a medium, and the medium fits pe"
0,"Ick I look like a stuffed sausage in these pants and i even went up a size. for some reason, this fabric isn't working for me. i think it's the sheed combined with the stretch (or lack there of) of the fabric. i'll have to pass."
1,"New favorite pant I can't say enough about this pant! the fit is perfect, enough shape to hold you in but not so tight you think you're wearing leggings. this is my go to business casual. can't wait to get another color, my store had this in black"
0,"Fatal design flaw... zipper in the back? These would have been the perfect black pants! great cut, love the wide band in the front, true to size, quality construction. but a zipper in the back?!!! i had to ask my husband to help me zip them up. perhaps they would be easier to put on if my bum were a little smaller, but the pants fit perfectly - they were just too hard to put on. sending them back, since i don't have an assistant to zip them up whenever i need."
1,"""formal pajamas"" These are super comfy and so flattering. i feel like the picture doesn't do them any justice! they would also look cute paired with wedges!"
1,"Super comfy , great fit I like these pants a lot. got one pair in black
and one pair in holly. the green holly are just a perfect green, so nice for the season. they are very comfy and feel right all day without any sagging.
i highly recommend and would buy more if they weren't on the pricier side.
oh and great for causal but also dresses up nicely with some heels and a silk blouse"
0,Another big boxy top I had high hopes for this top but once again it is just a big boxy too much material top. i get the style but if it adds 10lbs to your middle area its not for me. it is a thin material so it does hang nice.
1,"Lightweight classy work trouser These trousers are not lined. there is a wide elastic band that runs along the inside of these slacks that is not tacked down, which is a little cheap and probably to keep the price down but doesn't affect the overall fit. and they do fit nice. when your putting them on the fabric bunches at the crotch but then slims out after you zip them (zips up the back.) the fabric has some spandex in it but the lyocell makes them a great choice for work. they hit my ankle a bit lower than on the model. i'm"
1,Great wardrobe basic You can't go wrong with these pants. as other reviews point out when they say skinny they do mean that this is a skinny fit so order accordingly. i ordered a 4 when i have been wearing 2s in many other styles and was glad for the 4. i thought the fabric was all season so don't agree with some other reviewers regarding the stiffness of the fabric. i think it's perfect. everyone is different. these are pretty close to year-round wearable.
0," Purchased these pants that i had quickly tried on. when i got home, i re-tried them and felt they were too snug and the material had an odd feel and did not lay right. i took them back and tried them in the next size. they fit much better but the material did not lay well on me. i think that they are a bit too stretchy and ended up not buying the larger ones either. i would definitely recommend trying these in a store rather then ordering online."
0,Terrible I'm 5 ft 7 125 lbs true size 4 and these pants made me look like i had boy parts. super disappointed!
1," I really love this top; i got the ivory and now i will probably get the black too. if you get it in your normal size (i'm almost always an xs and got this in xs), it's fitted and flattering. the seam across the sternum makes it feel like an empire top which always seems to look good on me. it is fitting in the chest and arms. it's really lightweight and has 1/2 sleeves so i will wear this even in summer."
1,"Treasure This jacket is a real treasure and i could never have seen how substantial the embroidery is from the photo. also from the pic the jacket looks like a thin cotton, but on the contrary it is a wonderful weight with a feel like denim. the embroidery is a wonderful texture like heavy string or thin rope so it really has dimension... . i loved it so much i got the sweatshirt also by the same designer. can't wait until cooler weather so i may live in it! also when you have it on for a bit it seems to"
1,"Super soft but stretch I purchased the grey cords on sale. they are super soft and stretchy- the do run large, so you may want to size down. otherwise, nice fabric and cut."
1,"Love this top! Just bought this and am in love with it. it's a really nice weight - light for spring. the drape-y fit is very flattering. it's longer in the back than in the front and has a nice swing to it. can't wait to wear it!

i tried on the tee in the lighter color and didn't care for it much - i liked the contrast of the black and silver stripes."
1,"Great fit & flattering cords Love the cut on these cords as well as the fabric. it's a somewhat thin corduroy with a nice little stretch which makes them very comfortable and very flattering. they are true to size. i got the grey which is a pretty, light grey without the heavy blue undertone you often get in grey fabric.

great cords!"
1,"Maaji patchwork top I'm a 0/2 on top with 32d's and i purchased this top in a medium and it fit perfectly. pretty colors go with a mix of bottoms. design is both functional and attractive, which usually isn't the case with swimwear. love the underwire cups, adjustable ties and straps. and the fabric is really soft and comfortable."
1,"Great look. I just bought these in store. so great looking. however, i bought the petites and they are still incredibly long. like 6 inches too long. so, i'll hem them, though based on the review that mentions shrinking, i might wash them first to see what happens. great for summer in the city."
0,"Not for my body type I own the essential slims and love them, so i figured i could order these in my normal size and they'd fit great. i was way off. they were uncomfortably tight in the calves (which is understandable - i'm a runner so my calves are disproportionately large) and uncomfortable in the waist. i decided to order one size bigger and pretty much had the same problem in the calves. the high waist was also still unflattering and uncomfortable. these might be great for hour glass shape with skinny calves. t"
1,"Great pants! These pants are a great addition to my work wardrobe. i needed to size up more so for my legs vs my waist, but nothing a little tailoring won't fix."
0, Cute fit but... split in the thigh after two weeks. and i'm not a big gal. poor quality.
1,"Cute but runs small and short I love this top, the beading and detail is wonderful, i actually liked it even more when i saw it in person. but when i tried it on it is really small in the neck and arm openings and seems short, definitely a different fit than how it appears on the model. i'm trading in for a size up and hoping that does the trick!"
0,"Lint magnet So sad becuase i like the design. i would not recomend the lack to anyone that does not live and work and shop in a completely immaculate environment. i wore this to work the day after purchasing and within three hours i honestly looked like i had slept in this sweater for three monthe straight. i had to take the sweater off and work in a t-shirt. 
the marigold color may be better than the black abut showing lint but something intrinsic to the fabric really attracts lint like nothing i have eve"
1,"Very cute and fun at the same time I ordered online and got it home tried it on and loved it. it is too cute i plan to wear it with bright colored belt and shoes probably red, yellow, or pink plus i bought a polka dot tote same color cream and black and a blazer can't wait to wear it. i love the fact that i can wear it spring, summer, fall as well winter with my blazer. i'm keeping it."
1,"Soft and substantial I'm 5'5"" 120 lbs and bought this in size medium because i have long arms and was afraid that the cashmere would shrink even if i hand-wash and dry flat (because let's be honest--i doubt i'll ever send it to the dry cleaner). it's loose through the body and arms, but the sleeves are the perfect length. the term ""bell sleeve"" is no exaggeration. the sleeves are billowy and voluminous and i can see them getting in the way while washing my hands or doing dishes. i guess i will have to reserve this s"
1,"Beautiful print, but runs very large This print is beautiful and the design is unique and great for work. my only complaint is that it runs huge and the torso fit is extremely boxy. i'm normally in between a size xs and s at retailer, bought the xs in this shirt and it still almost too big."
1,"This shirt is a great everyday shirt! It is very comfortable and the fabric is amazing. it runs a little short on me because i have a long torso, but it works great with a tank underneath. love it!"
1,"Love these pants Love these pants . very flattering and comfortable and cool. perfect for the hot summer days.

they have washed well. need ironing. the charcoal ran a little bigger and too long but the hot dryer shrank them . the orange were perfect, still a little longish so i cold wash them and hang to dry to keep from shrinking

5.5' size 8"
1,Beautiful top So flattering on my curvy (and busty) body.  so many swing style tops have too much fabric and make you look larger than you actually are.  not the case with this top - the fabric and cut make the bottom half flow beautifully; so flattering imo.  i usually wear a small or medium in meadow rue and went with the small.  the shoulders and arms fit my small bone structure perfectly; the burn out pattern and color are gorgeous.   can?t wait to wear!
1,"Looking forward to wearing these fancy pants! These pants are awesome! very light weight and will be great for spring/summer. now if only the sunshine will get here and melt away all of this snow!

i also purchased the top pictured on the model, it is super cute with this outfit and can work with so many different looks. check it out!

they run big, i would definitely consider sizing down or ordering two sizes to try on."
1,"Excellent quality Love this top and the fit is very true to size. i am 5'3 and 144 and ordered a medium. the fabric weight is just right and not see through, the top did not gap and the length falls just over tummy without being too tent-like too snug or too long so can be worn inside or out. wish there were more color choices to order from. it was touted as red motif but i would call it more red-orange. i cannot wear orange but it is ""red-enough"" to pull off on my skin tone with the white background. the sleeves"
1,Favorite linen pants I love these pants so much i had to write a review! purchased the carbon color recently in regular length - the length stated is pretty true and there was minimal shrinkage for me. size was also tts (typically wear size 2 and got 26). i've been wearing them often! they look great right out of the dryer and drape nicely. i've been purchasing the pilcro linen trousers for years but these are my favorites this season --- i also think the quality is much better. i will be getting them in more colors
0,"Big! Run large and leg is very wide. even sizing down, they seemed too floppy."
0,"Bummer! Ugh, i hate that this didn't work! the top shoulder/sleeve portion is so pretty and unique, but the fabric is overall this and cheap feeling, the length is too short for how flowy the shirt is (the sides go way up on me). the fabric feels like something that would fall apart after one wash. back it goes!"
1,Comfy chic I got the black in an xs and it fits wells. its a bit warmer than i expected. i love the design of this sweater! perfect with leggings.
1,"Chunky cashmere I bough a green, size s (140lbs., 34b, 5'8). the sweater is true to size: it hits at my low hip and, although it is cut generously, it is cut close to the body. the ""green"" color is very pretty and true to the monitor depiction of a bright turquoise. the material is very soft and definitely high-quality cashmere with no itch factor. however, the knit of the yarn is very chunky, which means that this is not a slimming garment. moreover, since i have long arms, the bell sleeves do not reach my wri"
1,"Cute romper I just received this in the mail today, it is very cute however it will be going back, if you look at the picture of the back it look like there is only one opening however below the knot there is another opening,"
1,"Perfect shirt This shirt is so cute alone with jeans or dressed up with nice jewelry, a scarf or cardi. its just the right weight, true to size, drapes nicely and its very flattering. i""m sorry i didn't order more when i had the chance. its already sold out in the colors and sizes i wanted. excellent quality as usual -- thanks again retailer!"
1,"Perfect I love how soft, and substantial the fabric is. the fabric has a nice weight and drapes beautifully. the ruffle detail is very flattering. i have broad shoulders and this top looks great."
1,"Good tee but not the same as past version Loved the version of this loc top that retailer carried two years ago (or was it three?). was thrilled to see what looked like the same top and was called the same name ... but it's just not the same. length is too short, body is too wide, and even the fabric seems to be lower quality. disappointing, but i still bought more than one color."
1,"I want all the colors These are fantastic, great fit, super comfortable material and perfect length (petite). i ordered the carbon to have a neutral pair, but i also want the other colors! 0p fit 26.5 in waist, 115 lbs. length on petite is enough to have a small heel) i have short legs)."
1,"Really cute! What a great, easy to wear jumpsuit! i love that the sleeves are a relaxed fit...sometimes they make these jumpsuits so unforgiving who wants to wrangle your way in and out? anyway i totally agree with the other reviewers that this is very stylish, comfortable and it looks amazing on."
1,Great transitional piece! It was love at first sight. the only problem was that it didn't come in my size. i took a chance and order a size smaller and it worked out great. its a great item that can be worn in the spring and fall. exactly what i was looking for.
1,"Very flattering Love, love, love. i have both colors and wear with leggings. it's not a heavy sweater and has a great drape, super flattering. i'm usually a medium and it runs true to size - not supposed to be tight. i find it a little low in the front,but a tank underneath takes of it. washes well."
1," Great style and quality. however sizing runs smaller than anticipated.
i gave it as a gift to a friend who wears a smaller size than me."
1,"Buy this jumpsuit! I went back and forth about buying this jumpsuit. very glad that i decided to make the purchase. i wore the jumpsuit to a holiday party and look forward to pairing it with a blazer for work. the material is very soft, yet durable. i wore with flats, but it would be cute with a colorful pair of heels."
1,"Floral print is gorgeous in person I ordered the red motif in size xl. for me, the fit matches the model so i think it's true-to-size. the only larger area on me is for the armholes. i use a cami so my bra won't show when raising my arms. since it's made of rayon/spandex and is a longer length, it's a little clingy along my hipline for my pear-shape. but, overall, it's so soft and comfortable. the colors in the floral pattern are beautiful. prettier in person. there's no problem with pattern placement either. a great top for summ"
1,Must have linen pant!!!!!! I love the coral color! allows me to add color to my neutral wardrobe! very flattering!!! i get a lot of compliments on them!
1,"Amazing comfortable pants! I really didn't expect to like these pants as much as i do. i ordered a pair of the pilcro linen wide legs and really loved the cute added lace details on them. i thought i would exchange these for another pair of those, but after trying both pairs on, i realized how much softer and heavier these are. i will keep the one pair of the pilcro, but they did feel a little scratchy. these have a very nice drape to them and they do make your bum look nice. i ordered a size 8, which is what i seem to we"
1,"Love! It takes perfection for me to pay this much for a pair of pants, and these delivered! i bought these pants love-at-first-sight in the carbon color. i have not washed them yet, so i can't comment on durability, but they fit like a dream. i carry extra weight in my thighs and rear, and these pants are very flattering and slimming, and don't pull and crease in the crotch area like so many other pants do on my body. my usual size fit perfectly, and the length is great on my 5'5"" frame. i can almost"
1,Cute cut but a little thin The cut of this top is cute. it's a great basic t with a little flare. it's pretty pricey given that the fabric is so thin.
1,"Even more beautiful than pictured This top is unique and gorgeous! i'm a singer and i knew i had to have it for an upcoming performance. it's got a really great ethnic/bohemian beauty and femininity to it. i saw the top on-line, then i went to the store to try it on. it is delicate- it has beading, embroidery and mesh, so one has to be careful putting on jackets, brushing up against things, etc. but it's well worth it. please note that due to the lining, it does run small, i had to go up a size. depending on how you'd like it to"
1,"Lovely and warm ""does this sweater make my hips look big?"" my wife asked. this sweater was one of my christmas gifts to this fair maiden.
.
""no, love, it does not,"" i said, but i looked, to make sure my reflex was also correct. it's a beautiful sweater for my dear bride, mother of our three children, and no, it does not make her hips look big.

in fact, it draws out all her lovely lines and curves, just so. and she is a modest girl, so she wears a little undershirt so that her cleavage is somewhat...um...suppre"
1,"Great casual pretty shirt! I ordered this shirt online without seeing it in person, and it is great! it is true to size (if not slightly loose fitting) and a thick cottony-material with a pretty design. could be nice for spring, summer, or even fall with a cardigan."
1,"Not for tall people Lovely pants, incredibly comfy fabric, but too short for 5'11'' people. stated inseam of 31.5 is a bit understated, but it is clearly not 34"" that i need. had to take it back to the store."
1,Great fit! I love this top!! very comfortable. wear it alone or under a sweater. i have the black also.
1,"Absolutely beautiful! For reference, i'm currently hovering in the 14 range for pants (called ""curvy"" on the lower half, hahaha), but purchased these in a 12. they are so flattering and comfortable, i returned to purchase a pair to keep stashed for when i wear out a pair and actually bought two pairs in a size 10 for when i loose weight. they look perfectly tailored! the fabric is substantial (more of a spring weight than summer), so you don't have to worry about showing skin beneath the unlined pant, and it drapes e"
1," Ordered this blouse in a small but it was too big, returned it for an xs. i weigh 123 lbs , i'm 5'3 1/2"".
i find sizing of clothing at retailer to be unreliable, i have had to return many items because of sizing issues. unfortunately i live too far away from a regular store so have to rely on shopping on line.
i will complement retailer on the unique designs of the clothing they offer."
1,Gorgeous and flattering! I love this top. the quality is topnotch and it's true to size. it's not skintight but it's also not so roomy that you look pregnant! one thing that surprised me is that it's a silk material. i thought it was linen or something like that. but i love it!
0,"Just ok... I believe that this sweater is by moth and not knitted and knotted as noted in the description. for me, this tunic was just ok. i didn't think that the quality was great and it just didn't wow me, especially at this price point."
1,"Spectacular! The pics online for this dress are horrible in comparison how stunning this dress is in person.
just received it and far exceeded my wildest expectations!
it is elegant, classy, and an understated sexy!
the colors are rich and vibrant.......gorgeous shades of plum and blue....a unique color combination that is gorgeous!

1,Whimsical Looks so fun and whimsical on. love love love this for photos especially
1,"Gorgeous jewel tone color The other reviews stated this was a shapeless top, but i sized down and it is very flattering and cute! the green is a bright, gorgeous jewel tone. it has an overall flowy, bohemian look to it.......the bell sleeves add just the right touch of boho! overall, i am very pleased with this top... it will be a great transitional piece into fall!"
1,Only for smaller types I agree with the other reviewer the concept of this is fantastic. but sadly did not work for me. first of all it runs so small i normally wear a 6/8 and ordered a 10 and i still had a hard time closing over my 34ddd chest. but i am abnormal. anyways the peplum i wish was a little more subdued like in the photo. maybe its because im so curvy but it just didn't work for me. sadly its going back.
1,"Absolutely gorgeous! When i walked into my retailer store i was immediately drawn to this top. the online photo really does not do it justice. in person, it is stunning. i'm petite and usually a size 4, but the only sizes available were a 0 and a 6. it looked large so i tried the 0. it actually fit much better than i expected, considering i have a 32dd bust, but the seam across the chest was too tight. however i did not have a problem with the armholes, even going down two sizes. i have narrow shoulders, so maybe that"
1,"Absolutely gorgeous I happened to see someone purchasing this top in the green at my local retailer store, and the sales associate told me they had just gotten then in and they were already almost gone. they only had one left, in size s. it fit, but was a bit too long for me so they ordered the sp for me. it's perfect! the color says turquoise, but it's actually more of an emerald green. it's a bright saturated color, much more beautiful than the online photo. i have green eyes and love the way it brings them out. it"
1,"Not for me I ordered these with high hopes. i have 2 other pairs of joggers by a different brand that i adore. i was disappointed. the fabric isn't soft as i expected. the pants pucker out strangely under the waist band, but this might be due to folding while packaged. i tried these on several times - wanting to like them but just couldn't. i am returning them. the colors are beautiful - especially the bands on the bottom. they seem made well. it might just be that i am between sizes. i am 5'4"", 115. i tri"
1,Adorable and comfortable! Just bought this in black at my local store and it is adorable!  and very comfortable.  almost like your favorite t-shirt stepped up one notch!  it ran true to size for me!
1,"So soft These pants are so soft and super comfy.
they look great with heels and sandals. 
they will be my go to this summer for sure.
would love them in black or navy."
0,"Cute top, poor quality I loved the style of this shirt so much that i bought two of them. unfortunately after washing the turquoise one, it sprang several holes. the same thing happened to the second one after one wash! i purchased several of these shirts in the tank style over this past summer, and they have washed and worn great. i think the fabric quality and craftsmanship has gone way downhill at retailer lately. very disappointed."
1,"The perfect t! This is my go-to shirt. perfect for layering, perfect for around the house or perfect for topping an outfit with a scarf. the white is a little sheer but it's fine for me."
1,"Gorgeous blouse; there is a lot of fabric I'm a curvy person, so my review might not be suited to everyone. my standard size in retailer tops is xl, and it is the same for this blouse.

overall:
overall gorgeous, well made blouse but i wish there was less fabric involved and the burnt out design didn't make a horizontal stripe across the back and biceps. this blouse just might not work out as well if you are a full figured person.

1,Little something different for a t-shirt Nice shirt that's a little different from the typical. flirty sleeves that move in the wind which is a great look :)
1,"Perfect not too wide - wide legs These are the perfect wide legs.  they aren't overly wide (a common problem for petite women like myself, who cannot pull off the really wide styles), and they are nicely fitted in the top.  the fabric is a great weight, neither too heavy nor too light so they lay nicely. (the similar level 99 linen wide legs with the waist ties have a much lighter fabric that doesn't lay right, and i like these hei hei pants much better.). i said they run large because i tend the fluctuate between 00p and 0p, a"
1,Great top This top is cute love the ruffle sleeves. the store i got these had both colors so ended getting both colors because the top is cute. does run a little large i ended up going a size down.
1,"An elegant top I thought this top was purely elegant. i'm 5'4"", and 135 lbs. i ordered a small and it fits perfectly. i thought the fabric was soft, but somewhat sheer on the top. it goes great with just about any pant."
1, Love this top! i get compliments on it every time i put it on! it dresses up a pair of jeans perfectly!
1,Warm & cozy! This sweater is thicker than some of the other cashmere sweaters i purchased at retailer this year. it is made with high quality cashmere as it is extremely soft. i wouldn't describe it as chunky or bulky though. it's probably made of at least 2 or maybe even 3 ply cashmere. the sleeves do run slightly short. i purchased the xs and it fits my petite frame perfectly! grab it while you can! it's so luxurious & super warm for the winter.
0,"Too short waisted! I ordered this top in a 14, my usual size, and it fits fine, but it is way too short-waisted! it looks nothing like what the model is wearing. her top comes low on her waist, almost to her crotch area. mine was just about 2 inches below my belly button! it was almost as if they accidentally cut off the lower half of the top at the factory! very strange."
1,"Adorable and comfortable! I received this romper last week and have already worn it twice. it is soooo comfortable and the material is really soft. the romper is loose, yet fitted and very cute. i love the open back and the shorts are just the right length. i wish there were other patterns or colors available, too. i would definitely buy again!"
1,"Gorgeous top I purchased this top in the purple. it is much prettier in person then in the picture. the color is rich and vibrant. i am usually a large or xl but only needed the large in this top. 
the combination of fabrics is what makes this top special and the sheer bell sleeve really sets it off. 
i felt that it flowed perfectly, not as full as some of the fall retailer tops. (which are too full for me.)
i am around 5'6"" and a little on the broad side, so perhaps on someone smaller it might be overbeari"
1,Wonderful shirt! I love this shirt! the pictures do not do it justice. intricate detail. lovely.
1,"Make a girl's shape look wow! If you're a girl with no junk in the trunk buy these pants! they make you look like you are working with something! i love them. i am 5'3"" and always struggle to find pants that aren't too long and that will help me not look like an ironing board. these are great. not too long in regular and like another reviewer said, you'll have a booty. great lightweight pants."
1,"Nice concept Conceptually, this top is great. love the design and the bright crisp color and most of all the cut outs. the material is a little stiff but can see it softening up a bit with a wash or two. it does run very small. i am 145 pounds, 5'6: with a full 34c bust and a curvy hourglass figure 34, 28, 41. while it fits everywhere else, the bust is really small. i wear a size 6 but had to go up to a size 10. the size 8 fit but the chest would only close without a bra. so, i had to go up 2 sizes.. so when"
0,"Beautiful top, but.... I wanted to love this top. i wanted to love it so badly i bought it twice. the design and beading are beautiful, but the sizing is off. as another person mentioned it does run short, but that was not the issue for me. i ordered my usual size in this brand and the arm holes were too tight. because i really love it, i decided to exchange it for a larger size. i did not try it on in the store because i never wear that size, and just assumed the arm holes would be larger. sadly they were not. still"
0,"Sadly, too big and boxy This top may be right for some, but it did not work for me. i've been looking for a nice black top and loved the flutter sleeves on this one. however, it didn't do much to flatter my body. i ordered the xl, but it was huge. i'm not sure a l would have solved my problems if it had been available. i found it looked boxy and and agree that the arm holes are too big. 

the quality is great and style so pretty, though. i wish it had worked for me!"
1,"Great pants These pants are as dreamy as linen but much more forgiving when worn all day. they fit true to size and are very flattering. i have 5 pair. they are my go to work pant that can be dressed up with an elegant tank if i have to run to dinner after work!
love them"
1,"Fancy and fun I love it!!! i can wear out to dinner or just out to lunch with
friends!"
0,"Great concept, too roomy, elastic band looks meh I really wanted to love this, but it was just too voluminous to be flattering. i am typically a size 10 or 12 in dresses and jumpsuits, and the medium was billowing around me. also,the elastic waist hit me low and bunched in an unflattering way. it had to go back."
1,Gorgeous print! I love everything about this top! the fit and style are beautiful and the fabric high quality. it does run about a half size large (i'm usually a size 4 and needed an xs in this top). this is so versatile--i have worn it with a tangerine midi skirt and denim shorts and it looks great however i pair it. i highly recommend this!
1,"Runs small Adorable top, but it runs very small. i usually take a 4, but thought it may shrink up so i ordered a 6. it was a bit tight through the bust (34a), so i sent it back for an 8."
1,"Sheik and stylish I saw a photographer wearing this at a wedding i went to in october. i absolutely fell in love. it is beautiful. i can't wait to wear it for the holidays! i got the small petite and i am 5'2"", 125 lbs. fit great. enjoy!"
0,"Frumpy and huge I was debating getting a large in this top but went for the medium, boy is it huge, the jersey fabric is quite thick which makes the sleeves bulky and uncomfortable, even the small would be giant! 
for reference i normally wear a size 8/10 my chest is 34 e and this was just so so huge, it hung so badly of my chest that it looked frumpy and made me look bigger than i am.
the colours are true and nice and vibrant... definitely size down with this one"
1,"Versatile and then some I thought this was a fun piece to have, but didn't realize how versatile it was until i got home and started mixing it with either casual shoes, or dressing it up with fancier accessories.
i love this jumpsuit!
it is well made, and the fabric is of a quality that lends itself to both casual and dressy"
1,"Cute but a little overwhelming I bought a size small (5'6"" & 130lbs). it was baggy everywhere so i added a belt similar to the model and it did help some but the pockets stuck out too much. i ended up looking ""hippy"" with no butt. the material is nice and it is a nice quality. i just didn't have enough to fill it out anywhere and i felt if i got a xs it would have been too short in the crotch area."
1,"Stunning!!! Just beautiful dress! it dits perfectly, tts and i feel like princess in it! highly recommend girls!"
0,Beautiful but fit is off This top is gorgeous and i exchanged it 3 times hoping it would work. i originally got the size a would normally wear (a 6).and the arm holes and top were extremely tight and the top was short so i sized up and still had the same problem. i then went all the way up to a size 14 in order to get the length of the shirt log enough but now it is quite large around my hips. i love the detailing of the shirt but unfortunately if you have any chest at all it will not fit
0,"Lovely but... I found both colors and jumped on this shirt. then i got it home and realized that it was pretty much useless. there is no way to put a sweater or jacket over it, it is too hot to wear in the summer, putting a tee under ruins the look.
i am very flat chested so it hung well, but there is lots of shirt. both went back in exchange for two wearable items."
0,"Has holes after first wear! I love cotton fabric, so i was very excited to find this shirt in gorgeous fall colors. i have the dark red/burnt orange color, and it is pretty. but i have worn the thing once, and today when i put it on again, i found 2 holes on the front of the shirt. so disappointed."
1, Very cute top but it seems like it won't hold it's shape very long. cheaply constructed.
1,"Soft and flattering This top is the perfect staple! the fabric is soft and comfortable. i generally wear medium tops, but the small fits perfectly. took the chance ordering online and i am very happy!"
1,"Another fantastic top by meadow rue Fantastic and comfortable top. i had to buy in black and white, because it was too cute to buy just one. love it. great staple for your wardrobe."
1," This is a beautiful shirt. dressy, imo. it's tts, i would not size down in this shirt. can wear w/ black, white, moss, khaki, jeans, etc... love it."
0,"Beware of washing Absolutely beautiful top, worn once...hand washed and that's all she wrote..ruined!! the black trim bled all over the top!! i tried everything you could imagine to get this back to normal! do not recommend!! :("
1,Cute jeans Love my mother jeans and these are super cute for spring! they fit tts. i'm 5'7 and i bought my normal 25.
0,"Large with no shape This is huge. i thought it would be oversize but with a bit of shape. there is no shape to this and is a lot of material. i ordered an xs and typically wear an xs or s in blouses, sometimes medium in sweaters.
it seamed like 2 sizes too big. the material is very soft and the collar is nice. there is a ribbon tie at the waist. the tie is wimpy and could be nicer. when tied, there is so much fabric the is gathers and looks like i have no waist."
0,"Disappointed in quality and runs small I have been looking for an off-white vest and thought this one would be perfect, except it is going back. i am 5'9"" 150 lbs. medium is my normal top size, but this medium was tight even though the design looks relaxed in the picture. no buttons, so no way to close it. unlined and the design and fabric look more casual than the photo. not worth the price."
0,"Too short Love the fit of the jeans just wish there was a couple more inches at the bottom:) these jeans have a 23 inch inseam not 26, so they hit at a very odd place on my calf- return. for reference i'm 5'8,"
1,"Perfect for fall Great addition to my cold weather wardrobe! comfortable and has the slouchy look, but still nice enough to wear to work."
1," I was a bit concerned that the top would be too small on top, (ordered an xl) but the a line design is very flattering and it fit well. it is a biit see through, so i'll be wearing another layer underneath - personal preference."
1,"Looks good in person, shrunk a lot I bought this in size xl and it initially fit me similarly to the model. but, once i washed it (in cold in my machine, reshaped and air-dried), it was so much smaller/shorter. i loved the embroidery on the top. the mix of pattern colors is great too. i like when blues and blacks are mixed together. i don't know how i could have prevented the shrinking. i now throw on a shrug or jacket over to hide the shorter length. still stylish and fun."
1,"New wardrobe staple I can tell already that this sweater is going to be in heavy rotation in my closet. it's a bit oversized and cozy, but the ribbon tie makes it neat and not sloppy. great with skinny jeans, flares or leggings. super cute with a cami underneath."
1,"So comfortable I love this jacket. it is great for lounging because it is loose and comfortable, and it's great to have pockets to stash stuff in as i shuffle cozily around my house on cold, lazy days. it's not the world's most flattering fit (it's kind of boxy) but i bought it for comfort and i am delighted."
0,"Great idea..poor execution I tried on an xs and it was boxy/roomy in the torso and the pocket on the wrist/forearm area made my arm look too bulky when i rolled the sleeves up like the model pictured. i love the idea of a relaxed fit cropped leather jacket in a versatile taupe color but when i tried this one on in person, it took me back to my childhood. i used to help my dad wash his cars when i was a kid and he used a leather chamois (""shammy"" for short) that was awesome for soaking up water. and that's what it felt lik"
0,"Cute but cropped sweater This sweater is so cute and seems high quality. i would love to keep it but it is way too cropped for my taste, going down just below my mid section. i wish it had been cut longer- i would have kept it."
0,"Awkward fit I don't have a large head but i could barely squeeze this blouse over mine. i also ordered the xs even though i'm usually a small and it was still blousier than i would have liked. already returned it. on the plus side, it's gorgeous."
0,"Simple but overpriced This knit shirt is too thin, as most knit shirts i find are. i got this in the white, and was excited to try it on due to the fitted cut and cap sleeves. the upper part was great but the waist was too large for me, and was actually too long. had to return, especially for the cost. i purchased the xxs , which normally fits me."
0,"White/palm color is slightly see-through The suit is beautiful, however the white it is slightly see-through on the bottom front. even though it is slight, to me that is inappropriate...so i returned it. regarding sizing, i ordered a medium, i usually wear a size 6 (135lbs) and my body is evenly proportioned throughout. the medium was not tight at all but the back bottom region seemed cut just slightly less than ""full coverage"". i feel that i would be in-between sizes small and medium but did not try a small due to the slightly transpa"
1,"Lovely structured top hides flaws I bought this in a beautiful cornflower blue at my retailer store. i don't see that color for sale online. the blue material was not thin or see through, but perhaps the white is. the fit is very structured, which helps me cover my mom belly. i have never said this before, but i think it looks better on me than it does on the model wearing white. on sale, i got this for about $20. i got it for a steal. i like the different directions of line patterns and the length is nice too. one thing you can't"
0,"Beautiful color, poor design in the back I was so excited when i saw this dress! i love this color, and the poplin sleeves. i was so sad when i tried it on though, the back poofed out in such a weird and unflattering way. i think it is because there is a pleat high up in the back, but then it seems like it gets narrow again around the hips. strange. also the material is kind of stiff and seems poor quality. i do love the way the top and the sleeves look on me though, so i am actually considering keeping it and just making it into a top"
0,"Cute pattern, but i don't live this shirt This shirt is cute, nice cut, but i don't love it. best as a sleeping tank."
0,"Beautiful fabric, no cup room Got the coral reef color in a size medium. for reference, i say i am 5' 4"" because its easier than explaining that i am really 5' 3 and 3/4"", 138-140 lbs., 36c bra. size-wise, i am all over the place. recently i lost weight and have been buying smalls and mediums and anywhere from an 8 to a 12 from retailer. i so wanted to love this suit and am still in love with the fabric and colors. everything in the medium fit except for the bra cups. i am not especially big but there was zero cup room."
1,"Definitely not just a sleep top! I would not wear this to bed - it's almost too pretty! i've been wearing this top under sweaters and shells as the weather is moving from winter to spring - i think it transitions the comfort of plaid into warmer weather perfectly! it dips a little low on me in the front (34b/c), so it's probably not for more professional settings. i like to wear it with a lacy bra-type top peeking out underneath."
1,"Cozy sweater I absolutely love cozy sweaters and this is my new fave. i love that it ties and it feels elegant. so much fun with jeans and one of my fun tees underneath. or with a skirt, boots and hat. love it. i wear it as i'm sipping my tea in front of my fire place writing my book. yes i'm writing a book. its a cozy writing a book sweater-that is it!! its perfect for that. on my white sheep skin cozy rug and my animal print chairs. i'm in heaven sipping my coffee in my cozy room with my cozy sweater."
0,Nope! Weird fit and the tie just add to the problems. i think i'd like this a lot more if it were just an open cardigan without the tie. the tie seems like an after thought. it's flimsy and it just makes anyone wearing this look like a house -- no matter there size. i ordered a medium black and it's already in the mail!
0,"Black bleeds on cream! This top really is lovely. i had high hopes of it looking smashing with black jeans. i wash everything before i wear it. though this garment says it needs to be dry cleaned, there was nothing so delicate about the fabric that it had to be dry cleaned. so i hand washed it with delicate soap. when the lighter colors came into contact with the black, the black immediately stained the light color. i tried putting some stain remover on the black stains, rinsed and hung it above my bath tub. it is cur"
1,Beautiful unique dress Wore this to my sons wedding. found it last minute when i had changed my mind about another byron lars dress. i felt awesome in it and got many compliments
1,Great find! I love this vest! it's perfect for day and dress up for the evening. very comfy!
1,"Great skirt This skirt sparkles when you wear it- beautiful in winter. it is made well, great design and fit, true to size. it is a beautiful fabric with deep blue flowers stitched in, as well as soft silvery gold thread sewn into the background. great length too. fabulous."
1,Simply perfect! This rich color is so flattering!  i also love that it has pockets and can be worn to dressy events or can be worn in more casual settings.  the side stripes give it a young and interesting touch.  the elastic waste makes it comfortable so i know i will get lots of use out of this.  i knocked off one star because of the price.  i plan on paring this with tan sandals and a dark denim blazer to start off with.
1,Love it Love this dress. sooo comfortable and flattering. i typically wear a 4-6 in dresses or can be between small and medium depending on style and cut. i went with xs on this dress and it's still very comfortable and loose fitting. the small size fit fine but seemed like too much fabric on the skirt.
0,"I really want to love this top... I want to love this shirt, i really do, but it's huge! the top is tent-like, which would be adorable with skinny jeans, however the length of the back dips so low, the top kind of reminds me of pajamas. the color is beautiful, more like a light grey heather, and the white piping is like a shimmery ribbon material. overall, the top is cute, but it dips too low in the back and the bow weighs down the back of the shirt, so it makes it hard to adjust it in the front. sadly, it's a return."
1,"Feels like a dream This dress is so soft, flowy and comfortable! the material is very smooth and silky. i'm hoping it holds up well over time with washing. i am 5""5, 120lbs and i ordered a xs. the elastic waist is a tad tight but otherwise it fits perfectly - just as shown on the model in terms of length and how the top fits. i said it runs a large because normally i would order a s but i think if i did, it would be too long and the arm holes might be too big."
1," Like another reviewer said, the pictures do not do this fabric justice. it's lightly textured but still soft! i love the fit of this--just the right amount of oversized/flowy."
1,Just what my closet needed A sweet tunic with the distinctive lace hemline. the length is great - just right to wear with skinny jeans or over leggings. not too long but long enough for comfort over leggings! more of a boxy fit (just as expected). wore it with my skinny jeans and short boots and got many compliments.
1,"True love I saw this in the retailer catalogue and knew i had to own this dress. everything about it speaks to me on a cellular level. the colour, the shape, the drape, the hem, !!!! and the little side stripes. be still my heart. i went into my local store and picked up the dress in xl and l to try on. i'm.... currently a new body shape because of too many burgers, a sports injury, and not enough cardio, so i figured i should size up for a moment. uh no. the xl was like a tent. fabric everywhere. i pulled"
1,"Comfortable summer dress I tried this dress on in the orange and loved it on me and felt it ran tts in my regular size small. i'm a 34d but very petite body type otherwise and didn't feel like this billowed out as much as some other reviewers described. it does have a loose feel on top which i actually like and inside there is a comfortable striped strapless top part that holds me in at the same time. i liked the feel, colors and lenth of the fabric plus i love anything with an elastic waist so i definitely plan on buyi"
1,Super cute! Love this sweater so much that i'm going to order another when it goes on sale! the material is not thick but it's a nice thin weight that i still feel cozy in. i love that it's not long in the back too. so cute and soft.
1, This jacket is a great buy at the sale price. drape is wonderful and the weight is nice; lightweight and will transition well from summer to fall. the adjustable ties at the waist make it very flattering on a curvy figure. i purchased the white and am going to purchase the black as well. definitely recommend.
1,"Cute lightweight jacket This jacket is pretty cute in person. it is a nice thick gauzy material. the black is more like a dark washed gray color. while i do like the jacket, i feel like it is cut a little wide... maybe i should have ordered a size down. i usually wear a combination of 6s and 8s and am usually between a small and medium. i ordered this in a medium, but there was quite a bit of extra fabric at the sides and in the shoulder area. i'm returning the jacket for now, but might reorder in a small another time."
1,"Great throw on dress!! Oh my!! this dress is so cute! it fits me exactly like the pictures. i usually wear a 6 or 8 and ordered a medium. i maybe could have worn a small as well though. there is a lot of fabric to this dress, so if you're under 5'6"", it might overwhelm you! i'm 5'6"" and the medium was barely sleepy the floor in a low heel! this is s dress you can dress up or down. i also appreciated the neckline not being too revealing. and pockets!! that was a nice surprise! the fabric is a little thicker, so it's no"
1,"Too busy So this is a gorgeous dress, but it seems to have too many elements. i wish they had left off the white lacy decoration at the neckline because it seems to make the dress more ""girly"" than ""sleek."" i am short, so perhaps the multiple design features would be better on a tall woman than on me."
0,"Not great if you're tall Comfortable and soft material, cute design and nice longer length..however, i'm long waisted and this looked ridiculous on my me, elastic came up right under my bra and not at my waist. would be cute for someone shorter."
1,"Fun and classic I ordered the xs p and xxs p in the black one. i thought this would be a fairly classic piece to wear any season (cold offices in the summer, southern california in the winter). the xxs p was a bit better fitted, not too small, but the xs p was ok too, if you prefer a baggier look, so based on that i call it large as i would usually purchase the xs p not xxsp. (115 lbs, 30 dd, 26.5in waist, muscular arms)

the material is airy and light, but i am a little worried about wrinkling, we shall see."
1,"I like this one I tried on the xs in the store and decided to size down (and get xxs petite). it looked much better. the length was flattering, and as others mentioned, the bottom is nice and flowy. it is comfortable, and the orange color is flattering and i love the striped detail on the sides. good casual dress, but i can dress it up with a bejeweled belt. i am 115 lbs 30dd chest for xxs petite..."
1,"Great design! Just purchased this lovely sweater over the weekend during the 25% off sale. i went in to buy the rona sweater in grey (which i think is the same style with different name) but it was all sold out! the sa pointed me to a rack of these sweaters and i am happy with this choice! the back print is really cute and the sweater design and color is very flattering. it goes well with pants or skirt, and the front is not as short as i had imagined the rona sweater to be."
1,"Love it! Great quality, fit and fashion! retailer went back to the days of old with this piece and i am so glad! the piece is classic yet modern - real statement without going overboard!"
1,"Love byron lars This dress, like all byron lars dresses is a work of art. it has true quality of workmanship. and fits like a glove. i always get compliments when i wear any of his dresses and i have 5!. this one is somewhere between casual and dressy. perfect for a dinner out on a saturday night!. order a petite if you are under 5 5"""
1,This is green and runs large Just tried this on in store. the color in the photo is wayyyyy off. it's a hunter green and dark navy zigzag. for maeve it runs large. i am usually a medium or a 10 and a s worked best. i'm a 36d and there was no pull at the bust. will pick up when on sale (bc a hundo for rayon is laughable).
0,"Almost perfect, but the top is unflattering. The dress had great potential, but the top sagged and made the dress look unflattering on me. unfortunately, i had to return it. the length was great, and the back and sides of the dress were nicely tailored and flattering. perhaps this would fit someone else better - i have a 34b/34c bust, and it didn't work for me."
1,"Unexpectedly amazing I didn't give this dress a second look for the longest time. when the summer tag sale came about, i decided to pop in and see if i could find a versatile summer dress. i was in need of a piece i could easily dress up or down. the burnt orange color variation caught my eye first, though i also tried on the neutral and it is also fabulous. this dress is amazing on! i am an hourglass shape, 5'8, size 6/8, 34 d chest, and i tried on both the small and medium. the small fit much better on me, and i r"
0,"Beautiful fabric, less than beautiful fit I wanted to love this skirt. i love high-waisted skirts and the length seemed flattering on the model; it was not so flattering on me. the fabric is so lovely--truly the photos online don't do it justice. it's heavy and luxurious, wonderful for fall or winter, and the gold, gray, and navy floral pattern is not too flashy or bold. plus, pockets! however, the midi length did not work for me, despite the product's suggestion that it was a universally flattering length, just above the knee. i'm not"
1, Added this dress to my summer wardrobe in the rust color. it's a very relaxed dress. easy to throw on. as others have suggested in going to add a belt to this to add a little more flair. but i love this designer. but it does run large. sizing down helps immensely.
1," The fabric has a beautiful drape; the skirt is a nice length, and it blows, moves, and swings in a most flattering way. the gray is a an elegant color, and one could definitely wear the dress at both casual and more formal events. the top, however, sags, and overwhelms the more fitted lining. too bad!"
0,"Ewwww!!! I thought this dress looked so cute and comfortable and was excited to try it on, and i was majorly disappointed. it was incredibly unflattering, in every way. as a few of the other reviewers mentioned, if you have any sort of bust the dress will not hang nicely, the waist band was too high up and made me look pregnant. i'm 5'2 and curvy and usually take a lg in retailer, but this...ewww! i will say the color and material are gorgeous, but i'm guessing this is the type of dress that would look bes"
0,Nice dress but Lovely dress and looks great on me but with just my second time wearing this dress and reaching across my desk to pick something up i feel the elastic waistband snap. this dress is definitely my size and i have felt no tightness or discomfort in the midsection. i have bought cheaper clothes with better elastic waistbands and had them for years. now i will spend the rest of my day looking like i'm wearing an orange sack. i'm not pleased.
1,"Great lace shorts. I got these in black and i had tried on the gray in the store, they run small at the waist. i usually wear xs or small, but i ordered a medium. they are very comfortable on a warm day. they look great with a loose, tucked in blouse or tee. the down side is they catch and the lace pulls and gets fuzzy when rubbing against things. i realized this after a day of wear. i haven't washed yet, but plan to hand wash."
1,"Business in the front, party in the back Great, light weight sweater. very simple and soft from the front and the back is adorable."
0, There are darts that are not shown in this picture that make the dress ill fitted. not sure why they are not in the picture and on the dress. i wish the pictures shown were more accurate.
1,"Absolutely beautiful! This skirt is absolutely beautiful in person! the metallic thread is a subtle, stunning addition to this elegant piece. like the last person mentioned, it is thick, but i think it makes it look full rather than like a bag. i think the extra fabric/weight adds a more classic/traditional look to it, making it look more like a wool skirt from the 50s, 60s, or 70s. if you're not a fan of that look, you probably won't like the way this falls. like the description says, this is a piece that would neve"
1,"Love! I love this dress. i'm 6' so it's a tad bit shorter than what shows on the model. it stops right at my ankles, which i'm okay with. it's a heavier fabric so it's maybe not good for those really hot, humid days. all-in-all it is super flattering on my hourglass figure. for reference, i'm a 38dd and normally wear a large in dresses at retailer. i ordered the large."
1,"Perfect summer dress This dress is perfect for the summer, very lightweight, has pockets and not to short lounging around. it is loose fitting, so i normally wear a size 10 or m and 5'6"" tall, but had to order this dress in a s. the small fits me perfectly."
1,"Gorgeous skirt, but very puffy. This fabric and quality of the skirt are superb- there is a pretty metallic thread detail in the fabric that isn't easy to see online. however, the skirt is quite puffy, which i suppose could be good for someone with a boyish figure looking to add curves. but for many of us the extra puff might not be welcome. one would want to wear it with a tight fitting top and emphasize a small waist in order to counterbalance the volume of the skirt. could be a nice buy for the right person, just be aware o"
1,"Beautiful color, too full in the top The length is lovely, the color is nice, the fabric feels like silk but isn't (so you can wash it), and the cut is flattering if you're a b cup or below. for me, the pleats on top made my chestiness look like fattiness."
1,"My favorite dress ever! Many internet reviews note that byron lars dresses run large and suggest that women 5'5"" and under should size down and go petite. i am 5'3"" and 101 pounds and the 0 petite size was too snug across my back and too short when i sat down. when i stood up i had to pull the dress down, as it would bunch up around the hips. therefore, the size 2 regular ended up being a perfect fit, no alterations needed. i was searching for a dress for an upcoming wedding and for vacation and kept coming back to thi"
0,Buy at your own risk... I really wanted to love it but it was way too maternity on me. i love flowy but the flow on this dress hit me in all the wrong places. but i must say i have a 34ddd bust and wear a medium regularly. well i sized down and ordered a small and it just didn't work. it just flowed right off my chest to what looked like a dress concealing a baby bump. overall its cute just not for me.
1,"White is not white This is a very nice jacket in a pretty textured fabric. it seems to fit tts, and the cut is very flattering. however - the ""white"" is actually ivory. not a big deal, unless you were trying to match an outfit with pure white in it. still on the fence about whether to keep it or not."
1,Just okay I didn't fall in love with this jacket but it was comfortable and seems like it has potential to be flattering on many body types. for reference i tried on a medium and my measurements are 38-30-40.
1,"Perfect, comfy, feminine summer dress! Admittedly, i ignored this dress on a few trips to my local retailer and then it went on sale, practically begging me to give it attention. i tried it on and fell in love! so feminine, light, and comfortable. 
it has a sort of roman/boho goddess vibe due to the billowy top, especially in the lighter greige with some sea-hued accessories added but not so much it feels like cosplay or something. i have a full bust (dd) and didn't find this dress to be unflattering. after wearing it to a party, i ac"
1,Cute without the belt! A lot of reviewers have been saying that this dress is simply too busy to be wearable and they're right! i love the cut and fit of this dress but don't love the style. the awesome stylist at my retailer told me to take off the belt and then try it on with a ribbon ( like the one on the charisma sheath) and it was so much more cute. it completely changed the look of the dress and made it look more classy. the belt looks very cheap in person and a little hoochie mamma if you wear it with the dress i
1," Absolutely love this top, it falls perfect in all the right places. i've gotten so many compliments especially from the bow design on the back."
0,"Soooo disappointed! I was hoping these would be like some of the lace shorts i bought from retailer last year that i loved so much. sadly, no. first of all they run small. i am between a s and xs in most brands, bought a s in these because i like my shorts on the looser side. these felt a little snug and short, but i decided to keep them. the first time i washed them, they were ruined. i followed the directions exactly and even put them in a lingerie bag in the washer, plus a delicate cycle, no dryer. the lace is man"
1,Runs very large Lovely dress but runs at least a full size too big.
1,Great summer jacket I bought this jacket in white specifically for summer. it is the perfect weight for the office air conditioning coolness. i wore this jacket with a sleeveless silk blouse and summer skirt. it just looked perfect for a dressier summer outfit. i take a m/l in retailer jackets and went with the large in this because i have a large bust (36d). the medium fit but was just a tad snug through my upper back/front area. the large gave me a little wiggle room so i could wear a little heavier blouse undernea
0,"Greek goddess-style not for all! If you have any curves, avoid! it is not flattering.
the striped side panels look odd with the flow of the dress."
1,"Runs big Beautiful dress, but works best with a belt where the dress cinches at the high waist. it runs huge: i'm 5'6 and a m/l but the small petite is what looks and fits the best. there is a lot of unnecessary fabric and stretch at the waist. i received a lot of compliments on this dress! glad i kept trying on smaller sizes."
1,"Much cuter than the picture This sweater is so much cuter than the online picture makes it look! i think the model is wearing it too large. anyway, this runs kind of big, so size down. it's kind of short in the front, but it hits at a nice, flattering spot. love it."
1," Well made, versatile dress. have already worn it to a wedding and work - could definitely be dressed down for a more casual look. i'm 5,7 and typically wear a medium in dresses and the small was definitely the right fit with some room to spare."
1,"Dry clean?! Has anyone tried to hand wash this dress instead of dryclean?
runs a little large. i am 5'5 135# 34dd and purchased xs. i was really surprised that xs fits well. i initially tried small but the armholes were too big. the waist is a little too high but i plan to wear it with a belt."
1,"Beautiful design I bought this dress online after a long search for the perfect dress to wear to my daughter's fall wedding. i did not want something full length or too formal. after modeling several dresses for my boys this one got the thumbs up. i do love the design and that it is different enough from all the other mother-of-bride dresses out there. i will wear this with black nylons and wedges (since this wedding is in a meadow). i'm completely satisfied! for reference i am 45 years old, 5'10"", 160 lbs with"
1,Easy breezy I love this dress it is a little sheer so nothing that spanx won't cover. i have worn it a couple of times and have gotten many compliments.
1," I wasn't expecting to like this tank as much as i do because of the other reviews...i thought i would send it back if i didn't like it, i appreciate the design, fabric, and construction! i plan on wearing it out to dinner with some friends coming in from out of town tomorrow night...can't wait!"
1," The dress didn't look like much on the hanger but the rust color caught my attention so i tried. the dress fits beautifully. i did have to size down to a small because the medium was too large on my frame. i have a longer torso and the elastic waist did not quite fall on my natural waist, but corrected by pairing with an obi belt, which looks fantastic. the bottom is lined and flows rather nicely. the dress has a modified hi/low thing going where the front and back are longer than the sides, but"
1,"Comfy! This dress is super comfortable. it's s bit long, but i'm 5'3"", so that's to be expected. i wanted an everyday dress and i can't decide if the full skirt makes it too formal looking."
1,Color not as expected Still can't decide if i want to keep this. it's super comfortable but much thinner than expected and the color seems more navy blue than black.

0,"Wanted to love this skirt for the holidays... I am a size 2 and the skirt fit however it is so thick and voluminous, it looked like a pirate sack. it's unfortunately going back."
1,"Darling style ok fit I love the style of this coat and the way it fits on the model. in reality, the cut is more straight. i was hoping for some darting and a slimmer silhouette. cinching the belt makes the coat bunch unattractively. if i sized down, i think it would look better but i'm concerned that my shoulders will not fit. the fabric is 60% poly/40% wool and a bit itchy where it's not lined. the lining is a jersey poly blend. the belt has flimsy ugly string loops that cheapens look of the coat. other than the b"
1,"Not flattering on *me* I recommend this dress for people who do not have my body type. the dress is very comfortable and nicely designed. my torso is a bit barrel chested with a large bust so the fabric both wrapped and billowed out unattractively, causing the waistband to ride up and the skirt to pouf out over my tummy. if your body is more like the model, this is a flattering dress. for reference i am 5'3"" 36dd 140# and ordered the medium petite. perhaps if i bought the non-petite version or sized down maybe it will"
1,"Comfortable, long, cool The dark orange is a beautiful color. this is a very comfortable dress, lightweight, long enough so you can sit down in it without any concerns. unfortunately, it's dry clean only, and you may want a belt to cover the elastic waist. the top part is very loose, so this might work better for full-figured gals."
0,"Gorgeous color - weird fit! I liked this dress so much in the store - but didn't have it in my size - so had it shipped (and yes, paid shipping costs...) but it just didn't work on my body. the top is sort of poofy for lack of a better word - it made me look kind of poofy all over and really - i am not poofy! 
it's a lovely color - and might look terrific on a tall woman - but at 5'3"" - not so good - had to return, sadly."
1," This is my new favorite dress! it's super soft, comfortable, and flattering! i have worn it twice and each time have received multiple compliments. i love, love, love it!"
1,"Gorgeous dress This dress is beautiful. i ordered this in the mail and literally said ""wow"" when i took it out of the packaging. the color looks more like champagne in person and the flowers look fantastic on it. i was worried that it might look a little awkward with so many things hanging off, but instead the flowers really compliment the entire ensemble. it really just looks like a work of art. i'm usually a small in retailer clothes and that size fits me very well. i absolutely love this dress."
0,"Be careful of sizing This top is beautiful aesthetically, and i liked the tunic length. the bottom lace is cut out, so make sure things are adequately covered if you wear this with leggings. the fit is flattering.

however, i had some issues with the sizing. i usually wear an xs or a s in tops. the body of both sizes yielded a boxy fit for me, which is seen on the model.. i tried the top with a belt, which looked nice. however, the thing that stopped me from keeping the top was the shoulder/armpit/sleeve area. the s"
1," I wasn't overly impressed or drawn to this dress at first, even after i bought it, but after wearing it, i am sold! i paired the orange version with caramel colored sandals and gold jewelry. i thought it was necessary to wear a long necklace to bring some interest to the otherwise plain top. the dress is super comfortable - fabric, fit and length. it billows in such a pretty way when you walk! the color also made my skin look extra tan, which i loved! the waist is short and rides up now and then"
1,"Adorable Truly. adorable. as other reviewers have mentioned, much better in person than as pictured. the ivory has black, khaki and light pink polka dots. it is great with a pencil skirt or pants."
0,"Just ok I ordered two of these, the grey and ivory. i have had great luck with jackets and blazers from retailer. these were the exception. i just could not pull them off. the quality was great but they had little shape except being a bit boxy. i do have wider hips. maybe these would look better on someone tall and thin? for reference, i am 5'6 and about 138lbs. i ordered smalls and the sizing was perfect for me, the style was just off. i had to return both."
1,"Almost perfect dress I was desperate to find a dress for an upcoming wedding. i basically tired on every dress in the store. this one was by far the best dress i tried on. the outer layer is delicate, and has great stitching and embroidery. the only problem is that the slip is skin tight and too small. this dress is so awesome i'm willing to overlook that and find my own slip. when i came out of the dressing room another couple stopped to tell me how amazing the dress looked. this dress is beautiful!"
1,"So comfortable!! I ordered this online, having never seen it in person. i loved it as soon as i touched the soft material. it fits me perfectly...i almost invariably wear a size 6 in retailer dresses and tops, which gave me the confidence to order online, and this dress is true to size. the detailing at the bosom is so flattering. the fabric is supple and hangs gracefully without clinging to my not-so-perfect waistline. i have worn this twice already, having received it only a week ago. the blue/black combi"
1, I love this sweater! timeless--classical with an edge! i will have it until the end.
1, I'm writing because i ordered this dress and live it. i'm usually a medium but bc so many said it ran small i ordered a large...it was huge and i wear a 34d. it was huge everywhere. so now hoping the medium fits.
0,"Cut does not flatter Lovely palette and and fabric but the cut did not flatter my shape. the flowy cut broadened my silhouette and hit at my waist making me look bigger than i actually am. the overall effect was quite frumpy in spite of the flamboyant pattern. perhaps a better choice for someone built exactly like the model.
i will be returning it."
1,"Perfect ! J brand is by far the best premium denim line retailer sells! the fit on these jeans is amazing..worth every penny..also, considering it is a crop jean - warm weather wear - the denim weight is light and not too thick...the color is different from ordinary regular denim blue..lighter wash for spring/summer!"
1,"Love love love Quality, length, size, design are all perfect! i'm sometimes a picky person, but i can't say one thing less about this cardigan. it's all wool, but it feels so soft and comfortable. and it doesn't wrinkle. i put it in my purse for a couple of hours, still great when taken out. thin, but don't you plan to wear something underneath? it goes with everything!"
1,"My favorite kimono - very versatile! This kimono is absolutely wonderful. i originally purchased it for an upcoming beach vacation, but have also found it to be a great piece for my wardrobe in both hot and cold weather! goes with pretty much everything. highly recommend."
1,"Perfect fit an flare I actually saw angela from the tv show bones wearing this dress and decided i loved it so much i had to find out where it was from! after ordering this dress i couldn't be happier, i love it! it is a very flattering shape and a thick material so it falls nicely."
0,"If only it fit! I usually follow the boho look, and this dress appealed to me immediately and it was in the color i wanted black. so excited to receive this as i knew i could wear it both as a dress and a tunic but that was not to be.
the outfit consists of 2 elements: a tight fitting slip that fits awkwardly and does not give enough room in the bust nor waist areas, and an overlay dress that is really quite pretty. but it too was too tight across the bust area which made the entire upper torso ill fitting.

1,"Runs large I really liked these cords. i ordered both colors. they are very lush corduroy material and the color is very rich. since i am short, i wear them as ankle length (i am 5'1""). my only issue is that they run very large. i am normally a 25-26 and the 25 was still a bit large. unfortunately, they are all sold out of size 24 :("
1,"Love! I found this dress to run true to size. i'm 5'4"" and 115 lbs and the xs fits great. perfect length and i like the thicker fabric so it's not see through. the raw edges lend a cool laid back and the final embroidery is a perfect bohemian touch. wearing mine with a turquoise choker. awesome dress!"
1,"Petite sizing is more of tunic Our store only had one petite dress in my size in stock. i'm 5'4"" and so can sometimes pull of petite sizing. no in this case. it was a tunic on me. however the dress fit beautifully everywhere else and the quality was beautiful so i'll probably order my size in regular to give it a try."
1,"Beautiful swimsuit This swimsuit is beautiful. the quality is excellent. controls without being too thick. the colors are bright and the pattern is gorgeous. i am curvy , 34dd and the top fit perfect. good bottom coverage. very happy with this purchase."
1,"Not a swing dress Not sure who named this dress, but it isn't a swing dress. it's a beautiful dress out of very soft fabric, with elegant embroidery design and pretty fringe detail. and pockets! i've worn this dress with tennis shoes, leather flip flops, and heels and been complimented each time. love this dress!"
1,"Fun and different I love this cardigan, it is very soft, and unique (i am a sucker for polka dots). i tried on my usual size (xs) and it fit. i wish they did have it in petite, however. added this one to my wish list :-)

soft, versatile."
0,"Slip is too small... Dress is pretty, i was disappointed by the slip which is too small like previous customer. i am an inch taller than the model and i feel more comfortable it being a tunic with leggings. nice but not nice enough to keep, i am returning. :("
1,40s styling Nice work dress. flirty style for spring.
0,"Did not like the fit, but beautiful colors I really wanted to love this shirt! the colors are gorgeous, very vibrant and just as shown. the fit was all wrong on me. i ordered the petite xxs and it was still too boxy. and, it kept shifting so the front collar of the shirt would ride up into my neck. it looked like a sack on me. for reference- i am 5'2"", 112lbs...with a small frame."
0,"Disappointed I couldn't wait to get this dress from the online order. the fabric looked so interesting to me - linen, appliqu茫漏, pockets, raw neckline. the dress looks sort of straight up and down on the model but in my opinion it's like a little a line tent. the top runs very narrow and i could barely get it over my head. i'm going to return it and try for a medium, for reference i am 5'4""  135 and usually wear a six or a small."
0,"Beautiful embroidery, poor execution I loved this dress. the details in the embroidery are gorgeous and reminds me of another holding horses dress i own. what didn't work out is its a swing design but the fabric is thick and doesn't swing well. it's white and makes one look a bit heavier because of the generous cut. this could work on a tall person but on my short frame it didn't work."
1,Bought 2 pairs When these cords went on sale i bought a 2nd pair. they are great work week pants (i teach) - comfortable and machine washable. the fit is relaxed-trouser
0," These are a beautiful color, but run large. i ordered my usual size and they are falling off of me. they are very low rise so i don't think i'll be trying the smaller size, can't even imagine them being lower. also, they are cropped, that's hard to tell in the picture."
0,"Had great potential I tried this dress on in a 6 and a 4 (a 4 is a little small for me but it looked so loose and flowy i thought sizing down would be a good idea). the 4 fit in the outer layer, however as the previous poster mentioned, the lining is super tight. i couldn't even pull the 4 lining down over my hips. the 6 was far too big in the shoulders and arms and still too tight in the lining. not sure what when wrong here but it's a shame because it's a really cute dress."
1,"Very cute dress...for a different body type This is a lovely, well-made piece by maeve, a longtime favorite of mine. the material is great weight and won't wrinkle, colors are vibrant, and design of the dress is cute, if a bit on the short side.

however, i, like some of the other reviewers, didn't love this this on me. the waist hit slightly above my natural waist (and i'm very short-waisted) and this particular sweetheart neckline did nothing to flatter my bust (i'm a 34dd for reference). the end result was a bit too dowdy on top with"
1,"Soft, stylish and simple These pants pair well with anything - dress up or down, boots or sandals....but beware, they run big and rear end stretches out when sitting at work all day. if you have a booty these pants will be perfect buy one size down tho. if you have a flat rear like me, then buy two sizes down. length is good to leave uncured, just above ankle or roll up to perfect height. great color - fabric is amazing."
1,Super cute! I'm not sure why the other reviewers think that this runs small. in my opinion it runs pretty large. i am normally a medium and i ended up returning the medium to get the small. i do have a small bust (36b) and skinny arms so maybe that's why? regardless it is super cute and i think it can be dressed up or down. it looks awesome with the pilcro jean jacket!
1,"Very cute cardigan I tried this on in the store and came online for the petite size. the length was fine on me, it's only the sleeves that would be better for me in petite. this cardigan is very cute. the dots are a bit more arty-looking in ""person"" than you can see here - more like watercolor or ink spots, which is a nice subtle touch. i put ""runs small"" just because i think you might want to size up if you plan on wearing much in the way of layers underneath. the merino wool is not itchy, it is nice and soft. i"
1,Fun swingy black dress This is a pretty basic black dress with a swingy silhouette. the slip that comes with it is much tighter than the dress. the transparent sleeves and open-work details help it look a bit airier even though the shape is loose. the neckline has a flattering v-opening. i was able to try on a petite size at my local store (i suppose it was a returned item). the petite was still a bit long for me; it did not hit me above the knee but rather at or slightly below the knee. the dress was cute and comfort
1,"Pure love I absolutely love this light, soft cardigan. i don't think the pic does it justice. the black longer blouse takes away from it. i wore it to work with a white button down and received so many compliments. only wish it came in additional colors."
1,Very pretty & soft Great quality. very versatile design and super cute. runs small - i ordered up a size which was perfect.
0,"So unflattering I'm sure there's someone out there who will look good in this but it certainly wasn't me. admittedly, i'm a less than ideal body type at a curvy 5' tall. still for a taller person this shirt runs short, for a curvy person this does nothing to accentuate a waist, for a short person this pattern is very busy even if the colors are beautiful, for a busty person the gathers around the chest make for a very frumpy look, and even for a short and thin person this shirt runs too big to get a good fit. c"
1,"Needed a petite for sure and probably to size down I was too late to find my size in petite. boo. i tried the regular sizing and it was huge...a total tent. i am 5'4"" about 118#. i tried an xs. it was gigantic to say the least. huge everywhere. i love that the fabric is thick but yet doesn't feel heavy or hot. i think it would be the perfect summer dress...could wear casually or dress it up. don't need a slip (what a plus for a white dress!) i definitely needed a petite size and most likely from the size of the xs a pxxs. really? i know i have w"
1, Couldn't resist the polka dots! very cute and stylish cardi. since i'm short waisted this cropped style is perfect for me. i tried on the xs and small and while there wasn't a huge difference i went with the small since it had a bit more room. it's pricey so i waited for a sale to purchase!
1,Great fall colors This tops is super cute and great transitional shirt for the fall. a little short in the front but still a great shirt.
1,"Caz wedding ensemble I bought this dress to wear to one of the upcoming events leading up to my wedding in mexico. it's the perfect mix of casual yet refined. as another reviewer mentioned, it is a bit tight through the bust, but luckily i wasn't blessed in that area. i would caution that there is absolutely no stretch to this dress. it's a true, straight shift. i'm going to rock it with turquoise and flats in mexico."
1,"Beautiful dress...just didn't work for me. I wanted so badly for this dress to work on me. the design is amazing. the detail is so pretty and delicate. its my version of the perfect little black dress! however i have very big arms...and while i could have easily sized down for the body of the dress, the arms and chest in my normal size did not fit at all. i'm usually a 14-16 in dresses. i tried the 16 and it just didn't work. the arms were way too tight. however i've seen this dress on many other women with smaller arms than me, and they"
0,Cute but not for anyone bigger than a b cup I was so excited to get this dress and could tell right away it was beautiful. the fabric and detail are perfect and seem great for summer. then i tried it on ....to say the bust area is tight and not proportioned correctly would be putting it very nicely. it was a total joke. this dress is for very small chested only.
0,"Adorable dress, tiny slip The dress immediately caught my eye in the store. upon trying it on, i discovered that the slip runs extremely small (and unnecessarily so considering the looseness of the shift). the skirt is a tad long--i'm 5'6"" and it hits mid-knee. it's a shame the slip was so tight--i loved the dress otherwise."
1,Cute and comfy. Great fitting longer tee. comfortable and light. longer short sleeve a nice change from cap sleeves.
1,"Perfect winter lbd I have been looking for a black dress for a few events i have coming up this winter and have not been able to find anything suitable! i have tried a few things from free people but being 5'8"", everything there is just too short for these particular events. when i saw this dress, i had to have it! it has the same feel as some of the free people dresses but the length is so much better! the dress itself is sheer and not intended for extended outdoor wear, but really beautiful on. dress up with som"
1,"Gooooorgeous These colors!!!  my cup of tea!  i love everything about this top, from the fit, to the raw edge of the neck trim. it does seem like it will wrinkle easily but i can manage that for its sheer beauty!"
1,"Not for wide rib cage This dress is the perfect combination of bohemian chic. however, the slip below the dress runs a tad bit small. i have a wide rib cage and normally wear between a 04-06. the dress would have been just perfect if the slip was a bit larger."
1,"Slip issues are surmountable I loved this dress and wanted to use it for work. i read the reviews and saw all the issues with the slip and was nervous, but i tried it anyway and figured i could use another plain black slip i have if the one with the dress didn't fit. i'm really happy i did because it's a gorgeous dress. you just may need to wear a different black slip with it (i did). if you already have one, it's no additional hassle or cost and the dress is really unique. it's the perfect comfortable but stylish dress for"
1,Cute and classy Very nice polka-dot pattern. i so think it is versatile and can go with a lot of different colors. i am worn it was different colors underneath and both a skirt and jeans. it is a timeless classic!!
1,"Cute cardigan, fun piece This is a cute, fun addition to my wardrobe, especially since i am a polka dot fan! it is alittle short for me and i think it runs just a bit small, particularly if you want to wear like the model with longer shirt under it. overall, it was worth the sale price and will look good with casual pants, jeans and with dressier black pants for work."
0,"Super cute, horrible slip Super cute dress online on the model. what you can't tell from the picture is the slip underneath is not true to size of the dress and the outside layer of the dress is more sheer than the picture shows so you can tell the slip underneath is very tight. it might be my body type. otherwise, it's super cute in person and i wish it would've fit better!"
1,"In love I love this dress. so simple yet beautiful. very excited to wear this spring and summer, perfect for easter."
1,"Sandscape dress The overall color of this dress is more buttery white and the pale golden embroidery almost blends in.therefore i think the dress benefits from being styled . i tried bold colored scarves with fringes and big statement jewelry. this dress is more casual with its fringes , the jeans like material ( although softer than cotton) as well as the loose pullover style. it is easy to dress down with a blue jean jacket, casual sandals or even sneakers.

1,"Busty? curvy? no problem! I adore this blouse. the colors are vibrant (see my photo below). this is one of my favorite purchases from retailer. the top is light weight. true to size. i ordered a petite small and am 5 feet tall 120 lbs. and curvy. i left it untucked and loose like in the photo and it was very flattering. i disagree about it being frumpy. i wore it with kelly green retailer brand slacks paired with the retailer yellow sweater coat with white piping, and the retailer moss suede cross bag and neutral color (nude) fl"
1,"This dress is not like in the photo irl I really like this dress but after looking at the photo, it doesn't look like this, well at least on me. granted, i am 36dd so that might be part of the reason, but this dress is definitely trapeze style. i love the look but am cringing at the thought that someone is going to think i am pregnant. because of this, a belt is a must. plus it is the only way to achieve the look in the photos because it is a lot fuller in real life. 

another nice touch to this dress is that versatility with the ru"
0,"Disappointing I assumed at the price point this would be a high quality t-shirt/sweater. unfortunately, it is made of cheap looking material that is 50% acrylic and see-through."
1,"So comfy and soft These pants are perfect for any casual occasion. they can be worn to run errands, hang around the house, or even go out with friends. i love how versatile they are and they are so roomy for those times when you don't want to wear jeans or anything tight. they are a bit pricy, but i'm very happy with how they fit."
1,"Very pretty cardigan I love this cardigan. i purchased it in the cream color. however, it did fray a bit after washing it. other than that, i think it was a great buy though!"
1,More than a jogger So comfortable-so versatile-so perfect
1,"Love this airy top This top is light and airy, but substantial enough to wear with shorts away from the beach. its definitely not too sheer to wear without a bathing suit. i was actually pleasantly surprised at the flattering fit. it runs slightly big, but the top is fitted enough that its not shapeless. the colors are beautiful and the embroidery makes it special."
1,"Runs large I wanted to love this. the fabric and design are very nice. unfortunately - on my petite frame it looked like a lampshade. this would be very pretty on taller girls. for reference, i am 5'3 117 34b."

the fabric is light - but it's perfect for the summer"
1,"Deba vest First, this vest is made by elevenses. i love this menswear inspired vest. it's simple and structured, however, it's long on my 5'2 frame. the price is also a little steep, but it will add a nice touch to a simple outfit. i plan on taking this to a tailor to take an inch or two off the bottom."
1,"Disco-ball-summer-cover! I've been desperate for a swim cover that covers my arms & back. this one fits nicely--just a pretty, feminine, happy summer top that still lets me be leggy. i can't see them in the photos, but the embroidery detail at the upper part of this top has little mirrors sewn among the dots. very fun! i'm 5'5"" and when i paired this with jean shorts, everything below the crotch was visible--so perhaps slightly shorter than it appears in the pics."

1,"Not really a honey I was excited to see these on sale in the honey color i wanted. unfortunately, they were really more of a yellow than the golden color in the photo. also, they were so baggy in the rear that i looked silly, which was surprising since i don't have a small behind. unfortunately all the smaller sizes were sold out. had to send them back."
1," Unique vest: modern, chic. i especially like the color block one the collar part. i know it will become a staple in my working clothes, and i can also see it blend in to my weekend clothes. i don't think the back of this vest is of bad quality, like another reviewer said. overall it's a hight-quality piece."
0," While the fabric, embroidery and sizing are dead on, i just couldn't deal with the shiny little mirrors that the designer embellished this shirt with. that detail is not apparent in the photographs and i felt lessened the versatility of this blouse. so, it must go back to retailer."
0,"Love and hate. This is a beautiful vest. i love the color-blocking, the modern and structured style, and its versatility.  i bought it with a defective item discount because there were some stains. i promptly took it to the dry cleaners and was informed that the black would bleed onto the white paneling if they did a full wash. they spot-cleaned it, and it did bleed. although the tag says to dry clean this baby, the black dye will bleed to the white fabric. i'll be taking it back into the store today for a ref"
1,"Great skirt but bad craftmanship Already got a lot of compliments on the first day i wore this skirt. great fun shape, very flattering. however, the 2 panels were sewn using some type of hard/plastic thread which becomes very itchy when you sit down (you can literally feel it through the liner and i'm concerned that over time it might actually rip it). very poor attention to details..."
1,"Dressed up tee This top wasn't an eye catcher off the bat but i love nothing more than a dressed up tee, so it's why it made it to the dressing room with me. it has elbow length sleeves, a slub texture, super soft, awesome texture and detail. the slight v-neck is perfect and the overall fit is great. i'm typically a lover of black but the wine color was gorgeous too so i took both into the fitting room with me (the other colors weren't available). surprisingly, the black was not even close to a favorite, but t"
1,"Great shirt I bought the green, and it is a dark teal. the fabric is so soft and it can be dressed up or down. the detail truly sets it apart from your boring tee. great purchase, especially at the sale price."
0, I normally wear a medium in about everything and i bet an xs would've maybe fit me in this top. it's so billowy and not fitted at all.
1,"Comfort & style The shirt fits loosely, but not baggy. beautiful detail on the back and shoulders. very soft and lovely material."
1,"Not for all body types I tried this on at the store in black. the lace on the back is gorgeous and the fabric is very soft, but i would disagree with the previous reviews - i don't think this is flattering on all body types. i've got an hourglass figure and the top absolutely robs you of a waist. it drapes straight down on the front, so if you have a larger chest, you end up looking like a football player.

i think for a narrow frame or a smaller chest, this would be very flattering."
1,"Great shirt Love the fit - doesn't cling to my midsection and detail on sleeves is very pretty. fits true to size.
i got the black but want to order it in other colors as well. can be dressed up or down."
1,Flattering fit I love this tee! i bought the teal in store. rich colors. little details are perfect. the loose got was very flattering on me. i'm not busty at all and it hung so well. wore it to brunch and the flight home later!
1,"Relly cute I couldn't decide between the black and the red. this is a really cute dress that could be dressed up or down. just be aware of the high, somewhat tight neck."
1,Great casual top Love this top - it's flattering and perfect for a casual dinner out or running around on a saturday afternoon. super comfortable and very cute.
1,"Great top This top is perfect for a weekend casual look. you will love this, it fits true to size."
0,"Pretty fabric, soft, but very low cut I am 5'6"" and the neckline barely covers my bra -- would have to wear a cami with it. the fabric is soft, and the colors are very pretty. but the neckline is too low for me for a casual top."
0," Looks like a pregnancy top. a lot gathers in front and back. added 10 pounds to me. not flattering on, much longer than on the model. and the color is not white. it's white with a weird tan/ taupe stripe.
i returned it same day i received it, which was disappointing."
1,"Adorable dress! This dress is adorable! i purchased it in black and white to wear to my daughter' s bridal shower. i received so many compliments. it was comfortable, stylish and best of all wrinkle free. i actually ordered it online and when i got it, the dress required no ironing of any kind. love it! i think i may have to get in in the red also."
1,"Unique sweater! I just purchased this adorable, unique looking sweater at my local retailer store and absolutely love it. as soon as i saw it, i knew i had to have it! it is super soft, tts so i purchased it in my regular size small and it has the cutest pockets ever. the little black buttons also add to the look but the black snails on the pockets are what's really so sweet on this one. though i'm not a fan of snails in my garden, i'll make an exception for a couple of them making a guest appearance on this swea"
1,Perfect This is a nicely made and comfortable sweater that is fun to wear. i have worn it with jeans and a t shirt and have received compliments on it.
1,"Beautifullllll! I was looking for something for a spring wedding that wasn't too billowy, but not overly fitted either as i try to hide leftover postpartum pounds. this offered the perfect solution with the slip underneath the looser netted overlay (i got the black). the overlay is not delicate, but not stiff either - just good quality that falls beautifully. so happy with this dress - comfortable, attractive, unique...and versatile! can easily see wearing this to work as well as a wedding :)"
1," It's a very light material, so you can wear it early spring or early fall when it's still fairly warm. such a cute jacket, has no zipper or buttons though, so definitely more for style/look than for a crazy rainy day use! love it!"
1,"Black not red I got this in the red and the black.i returned the red,for it doesn't compare to the black one.i would have loved it,if it was a red dress with white flowers.i didn't like it being a white dress with red flowers.the black one is the one to pick!"
1,"Love it I love this top. the fabric is soft and a silky lightweight - perfect for summer. i feel it runs a size large. i'm 5'4"", 130lbs, with broad shoulders. i usually wear a medium, but a small fit perfectly."
1,"Adorable Cozy, soft fabric.  love the snails on the pockets and the cute buttons.  size down if you want a more tailored fit."
1,Cute...on someone else This top is very cute...on other people. i ordered my normal size (xs) and just did not work out. it's very billowy on the bottom (too much for me) and the top portion did not lay right. the material is thin so you will need to wear a cami underneath it. perhaps if i got the petite xs that right have been a better fit...not sure. in the end the top went back.
0,"Petite proportions way off Sizing is just getting unreasonable, and nothing fits unless it's a crew neck nowadays. this v-neckline would have been perfect if pictured as on the model, but on my 5' 4"" 115 lb frame, the xxs petite neckline came down so low my bra was exposed along the eyelet trim. additionally, the shirt looked like it shrunk in length, and wouldn't have covered a belt on my pants. it also did not match the product description and measured 22"" from the hps to hem. i'm unsure of how when pattern grading an i"
1,"Very comfortable fabric, great color/details I ordered the green/teal in size xl. the fit on me doesn't match the model. it looks looser on her. i think it runs small, at least in size xl. it still is a comfortable fit since the material has stretch. the pleat at the top helps the drape of the shirt. it's a beautiful color of green too. i think the v-neck is too low so i wear a tank underneath. this also helps with the transparent panels at the shoulders/back. my other dolan tops have held up well and retained their color through washing s"
1,"Pretty but runs long I bought a size xl in the white with brighter small florals. i paid full-price as a splurge for summer. the details on the top are just as nice in person as shown in the photos. it's a sweet top. i love the upper portion. however, it runs long. i need to belt it/tuck it or it looks strangely like a long-tunic. the floral material is slippery and a little heavy. not the softest but it's washed well. i love the mix of laces at the top. it's pretty. not worth full-price but on sale, it's worth tryi"
1,"Perfect seasonal transition top I fell in love with this top as soon as i tried it on; it's the perfect spring-to-summer top. the fabric is light and airy, and the brown stripes give it a lackadaisical vibe. the little buttons on the back are a cute detail that really give something extra to an otherwise simple top, and the v-neck did not reveal any cleavage. i bought this in a large, and i'd say it runs a little on the larger side, but i like that because it adds to the comfortable, flowy nature of the design. for reference,"
1," I ordered this top in the white and cream color combo and love it so much. the buttons in the back add a sweet touch - easy top for fall, spring (easy to throw a cardigan over), and summer. i ordered a medium, but probably could have done a small. classic retailer!"
1,"Snail cardigan I love quirky and unique sweaters/ cardigans, and this is no exception. it's not obvious in the photo (at least it wasn't for me), but the cardigan does have buttons all the way down, and not just at the top, something i appreciated. those buttons, however, are not easy to un-button. the snails are adorable without being childish. i'm 5'4 130lbs, often between a small and medium when it comes to cardigans. i chose the medium for this one, which fit exactly how i wanted it to (a.k.a. sleeves were"
1,"Pretty, but not for me I purchased this on one of retailer's 40% off sales, and got it for a great price. if you're looking for a pretty, comfortable t-shirt that's a little beyond the basic, this fits the bill. unfortunately the neckline was just a tad wide for me in the xs. i felt like it might show a peek of my bra, and when i adjusted it higher, the soft, stretchy material showed bra lines underneath. that issue, and the fact that the shirt is on the flowy side made it less-than-flattering for my small frame, but i"
0,"Wanted to love it! Well, i wanted to love it and it was just too much. i think it is a bit wider and weirdly baggier than it should be. i also feel it should be fully lined. it was not. the exterior wool and pattern is very nice. maybe if it was lined, a smaller size would have worked better, but for the price, i needed more. i also would have liked some sort of option for tightening the waist a bit when zipped up. i realize this isn't in the picture, so no expectation, but upon trying it on and seeing its boxines"
1," I like this sweater for its classic shape and grosgrain ribbon finish on the placket. it does have buttons all the way down and they are a little hard to open but the style is fun and fresh. it will dress up or down as shown with jeans and tee shirt. fit is like on the model for me in a large as i usually wear a 10-12 on top. the arms are quite long even for me at 5'9""."
1,"Great slip but runs small This sleep is super flattering on but it runs quite small (and short). it has a lot of stretch to the fabric and my normal size felt like i had a large spanx slip on. like i said, great slip but i'd recommend ordering up a size if you want it to look like the model."
1,"Wanted to love this...but This dress runs so large, why did they not make an extra small. the material and detail are great the flow in the back is different but is flattering. i wish wish that they made this in the extra small, i was swimming in it, there was no way to fix it so it went back"
1,"A good tee I'm not usually a fan of tees as i'm a little but busty, and don't like material that clings. the color of this tee is gorgeous, though. the neckline is feminine, and it has it enough weight that it moves.
not sure how it'll wash, but will try to keep it out of the dryer."
1,"Picture a tad misleading.... If you look closely at the photos, the buttons are only shown as applied halfway down the placket but the buttons run the entire length of this fabulous sweater by moth. the sweater fits tts; i am 5'5"" 142 lbs and the m is just perfect with room to wear more than an average tight fitting tee underneath. it is a mid-weight nylon-viscose-cashmere knit with understated black cotton 'rope' snails on the pockets. there's nothing boring about it as is often the case with long-sleeved, navy blue cardig"
1,"Pretty Very pretty dress, perfect style for my build, bigger busted, muffin top. the material/pattern is really pretty."
1,You can dress the stop up or down.. This is my go to top during the not so cold winter days.. can't be dressed up or down..
1,"Cute and fun! I have been looking for a cute raincoat forever. they are usually ""just a raincoat"". when this raincoat arrived - i was happy to finally have something that was fun to wear. only issue is a little tightness across the shoulder area - hoping this will just slightly stretch over time. the rest of the raincoat fit perfect and i wouldn't go up a size because of the shoulder issue. i purchased a light pink tie belt to use with it so i can keep the front closed when it is raining. it looks really cute"
1,"Basic with a twist This is a nice basic solid top with the extra appeal of textured detail around the shoulders and back. the v-neck is flattering. this top can work with many different outfits. i only wish my store carried the petite length, as the regular was too long for me."
1,"Long on sleeves, short in the torso. and - snails. Well, it's the snails that really make this cardigan special. the buttons and the open work stitching are nice too, and the fabric is soft and warm. a note on the sizing though - the style runs short in the torso and long on sleeves. so if you are petite like me and considering buying the regular size because the petite is sold out - you'll be fine with the torso length but will have to roll or scrunch up the sleeves. that's not too bad because the fabric is soft and easy to push up at the sleev"
0,"Cute, but not best quality First, i love moth clothing and own many, many of their pieces. this is very cute and i purchased it to go with the jules tank. the other reviewers are spot on with the cute factor and that it runs a little larger than the cropped sweaters. the snails are very cute, buttons run all the way down...
caveat: it began to pill after only a having it on a few hours - and i wasn't doing anything to cause extra friction- just sitting and lounging mostly. i noticed pilling on the inside of the arms when"
1," The green is terrific, and the pleat in the back makes the top flows nicely. great if you have some muffin top to hide (like me). and the details across the shoulders and back makes it more interesting than just a t. i'm concern about the quality of fabric. lately there's much rayon mix and they tend to pill or wear out and get holes after washing."
1,Simply adorable! This top is just adorable! so comfy and cute. i love the cut and how it goes a little longer in the back. i will be wearing this a lot!
1,"Thank goodness! I have been having the worst trouble lately finding cute, comfortable cotton undies...until i found these. these fit like a charm, are incredibly soft, and don't ride up at all. (sizing in spot on.) plus they have the adorable lace trim that makes one feel nice and girly. last summer there was a nyt article saying that comforable underwear was coming back in style -- yay!!"
1," I tried this on in the burgundy color in the store, and hoping it goes on sale soon! the fabric is not too thin like some of their tops. i run the gamut in retailer sizes , but lean towards mediums. this top fit beautifully in a small! it drapes nicely and doesn't hug the body, nor is it too flowy, looking maternity-ish. i am 5'4"" 140 and 34dd for reference . it looks like it will hold up well and the bit of lace makes it dressy casual. if it doesn't go on sale soon i might have to get it anyway b"
1," This is adorable! light and breezy. i felt it fit true to size leaning on the smaller size of a true fit. i am normally an xs/s and went with the small, fitting as it does on the model. it's a lightweight 100% cotton. not a lot of give. the v has a tendency to pull and probably will need a securing stitch. which was obvious when it arrived from another store. :(. i think wearing it with a cami is a great option considering it is flowy on the bottom and it is a thin cotton. overall great summer t"
1,"Flattering top for all types Lovely top that seems to flatter all body types. fit is great, fabric is soft, style is lovely...great to dress up or throw on with jeans."
0," Runs extremely large. i got an xs and am 5'4"" 115lbs and this would have fit someone who typically wears a size 10-14 and is 5'6"" and above. very disappointed with the size. the quality of the fabric wasn't great either. i wanted it to work so bad but just didn't!"
1,"Odd fit I ordered this attractive top in my usual size and tried it on with great anticipation. it fit perfectly except across the shoulders, a problem i haven't encountered before. i've tried it on twice more (do i hope my shoulders will shrink?), only to see that it pulls across the top of the back as before. otherwise, it is so pretty and flattering that i'll be truly sad to send it back."
1,"Cute! The shirt is a very cute cut. it ""poofed"" out a little more than i thought and kind of looked like a tutu. but, i wore it with white jeans to work and got a lot of compliments!"
1,"This blouse has lovely features The blouse is lightweight and is double layered, meaning a light layer over a lower layer. it's not bulky and not super flowy...just enough. i'm 5'1, a bit busty, and generally wear a m in retailer and this blouse fit great. it's figure flattering and not boxy. may be a tad short for taller women."
1,"Fabulous retro style! The print and style of this dress is pure 60's. so fun! the black and white is especially striking. normally, i would wait a bit until the weather warmed up a bit more, but this dress is so cute and flattering, i just couldn't wait. the outer layer is actually sort of an open mesh. it's not extremely delicate, but could snag if you're not a bit careful. however, its the fabric that really makes it stand out so it's well worth it. i'd say the fit is true to size except if you're busty. i normally"
1,"Nice fit! I do love sheath dresses and this one is very adorable!
true to size and nice length.
the black and white is kind of a throwback to the 60s flower power era and really cute.
nice weight so feels substantial not the flimsy wrinkly type material; more like a crepe.
very nice!"
0,"Wide, not as expected, or pictured Wow this is huge! i'm all for the tent-look with the right style, but this was absurd. i could have fit two of me into the width, and with the peplum style, extra width doesn't flatter anyone. the fabric is also so thin that it doesn't hang nicely, it kind of floats around the body. if you want a wide top, then this is perfect, but if you wanted something that hangs nicely, look elsewhere. i purchased a petite s, my typical size."
1, This is a classic! not only is it reminiscent of a fun 60's swing dress but the perforated outer layer over a solid shift creates this modern edge to a reto style!!! love it!
1,"Great top I liked this top so much that i purchased it in two colors: green and wine. the top and colors are exactly as pictured online, the material feels great, and they fit nicely. the fit was true to size."
1,"Fun and comfy I originally eyed this dress online - the lovely and comfortable weight of it can only be appreciated in person, however. it's a dress i'd be able to wear for hours on end."
1,"Love this tunic This tunic is wonderful, wash & wear - comfortable and classic - love the trim. 

many compliments on this top."
1,"So sad to send it back but... Wow was this top huge on me! i am usually a large, but lean towards xl when things don't have stretch. i sized up out of fear that my bust couldn't squeeze into a large (36dd) and i didn't want the buttons in the back to gape. when i took this out of the package (i purchased the blue) i knew right away it was way too big. looked like it could fit my husband. the sides poofed out so far, i looked ridiculous (if you look at the photos, the model is trying very hard to control the poofiness with he"
1,"Cute top This top is cute and comfortable. i did order a size larger than i would normally wear. i usually wear a size small but i had to buy a medium (5'7"", 145lbs, 34b)."
1,Stinkin cute Love this sweater! i almost passed it up on-line because i didn't notice the snails. the sweater is navy and the snails are black. they are so cute and such a fun and unique little accent. the material is a moderate to light-weight sweater. the length was perfect. i have inadvertently purchased a bunch of cropped sweaters this year - this one is not cropped - yay!! the sleeves are actually a bit on the long side. i sized up a little with the idea of wearing it over long sleeved tops. i am typica
0,"Okay top I ordered this top online in two colors, and kept the berry color. i liked it while trying it on. when i wore it an entire day, the top just didn't look that good. it wasn't flattering, and it focused on the bad areas despite being loose fitting. it didn't seem very flattering. i wore it for one day and am not happy with my purchase. i wish i could send it back but i already wore it. the fit just isn't very flattering. it is loose but focuses on the curves not in a good way if you are curvy."
1,"Better in person This sweater is way cuter in person. the picture online does not really show the adorable contrast of the snails to the rest of the sweater. also, it looks like they photoshopped out the fact that the buttons run the whole length of the front. really cute and soft (not itchy). highly recommend"
0,"Too bad I just got this in the mail the other day. i was really excited and then crushed. one, buttons go all the way down and not what is in the photo. it takes it from hip whimsy to granny old lady sweater and then the minute i put it on it started pilling. it looked old and i wore it about 6 hours. i also used the roller lint remover on it and it pulled off one of the eyes on the snail. it is soft and felt comfy but look raggy and therefore it is going back. too bad but not what i bought and then not"
1," It runs large but thats okay, its great quality and super super soft! i love the way it makes you feel so comfortable. very disappointed the clip fell off."
1,"Unexpected color, fantastic coat I bought this during a 20% off sale which made it even more worth the price. i would have purchased and kept it regardless, but just got lucky.

looking at the pictures online, i thought the coat was going to be red. however; when it showed up it is more purple. i still like the color and did end up keeping the coat.

i do think the buttons are sewn on well, but i was surprised it did not come with additional buttons in case one gets lost. these are very unique buttons so i can't imagine it woul"
1,Adorable one piece Seafolly is my favorite brand in swimwear. i've collected a few over the years. i was so happy to find this print. the little umbrellas are so cute and fun. i am normally a size 8 in seafolly and this one ran true to size.
1,So pretty This robe is such a pretty design. very flowy- runs slightly large in my opinion but was so cute i decided to keep it!
1, I love this dress! i wore it to my friends bridal shower and got so many compliments! i can't wait to wear it again!
1,"Petite runs small/short I ordered this dress in the black p8. i am 5' 3-1/2"", 140lbs, 34dd. i am average length in the torso area.. when i tried it on i wasn't able to button the button at my chest and the belt came slightly above my natural waist line. the length of the dress hit above mid thigh. way to short for my comfort level. it almost looked like a babydoll dress or a tunic to wear over jeans! the material is good quality and has a nice slip lining underneath. another nice thing is that it has a hook and eye clo"
1,"Absolutely adorable I purchased this pretty printed dress as soon as i spotted it on-line and ordered it in my usual size petite 6 (i'm 5'4"" 34d-27-35) and found it fit me tts and looks just perfect on. i immediately adored all the different prints on this one, the length, the sweet sleeves and waist band and think this will look so adorable with a jean jacket paired with a cute pair of boots this coming fall amd winter. it's a great transition piece that also looks really cute with sandals or clogs as well. also,"
0,"Runs at least two sizes small This is one of the best potential dresses i've seen from retailer, but it needs a do-over. i'm usually a 12 in this style of dress, but i sized up to a 16 (the largest size) and couldn't even button the top. even if i had been able to do so, i would have worn it as a tunic. i am 5'5'' and the largest size would have been a racy mini skirt at best on me if worn as a dress. this dress is fit for only the tiniest and most small-breasted of people. that said, if the company were to try again ne"
1,"I expected color to be different. This coat is beautifully made and for $800 i expect no less. however, i should have checked other resources prior to buying. the color on this website is nothing like actual color of coat. i was expecting a nice dark red/wine as depicted on these photos. however, it is a bright magenta/dark fuscia more on the purpleish side that does not go so much with my wardrobe (even though i am a pink-loving person haha). i had hoped to pair it with the same skirt shown here and the peony sweater that was i"
1,Love pattern I love this top.the only thing negative is how thin and cheap the material feels.
1,"Love *almost* everything about it This suit is well made, and is so darn cute. i usually wear a 6, but i am a size 8 in this (8 us size, although the main tag is australian size. they send out based on the us size ordered). the only issue i have is that i have a long-ish torso compared to my size, so it's ever so slightly tight in the crotch, but not enough to make me send it back. i have small boobs, so the extra padding is nice. i'm and athletic 5'6"" and 130 lbs."
1,"Elegant top I was very excited when this top arrived in the mail! it is so, so beautiful. i love the material and the brightness of the colors. it will be a perfect top this holiday season."
0,"Great idea, mediocre execution I really wanted to love this dress, but i think the proportions are very weird. i'm 5'7"" and usually go for an eight in unstructured dresses and a 10 in more structured dresses.
it runs small throughout, and is too short for me to feel comfortable wearing to work. the front is nicely detailed, but the back looks weirdly forgotten and could use more detailing. i tried on three different sizes (8,10,and 12) and they all pulled weirdly at the chest. there's a little slip that goes with the dress, w"
1,"Lovely dress This dress will be very useful. it fits loose, but it is suppose to. i plan to wear this to casual parties, out to dinner, and possibly a wedding at a winery. i weigh am 5' 6"", weigh 145 lbs, and ordered a medium."
1,"Pretty and flowy A successful first date sweater. the cut is flowy so don't expect snug. the quality is average for retailer sweaters, i guess nothing will ever be pill-free? the detailing at the bust reveals a little of what lies beneath, which in my case was just a bra but in more conservative environs might have to be a camisole."
1,"Had to buy it. I tried this dress at a store today and ended up ordering it online. i tried the red which is a beautiful, vibrant color. i wasn't sure how it looked on my skin tone though (pale like death), so i ordered the black. i do believe it runs small in the chest and shoulders. i am normally a size 4 in shirts, but the buttons were straining over my chest and my shoulders felt constricted. i tried the 6 and it was plenty roomy. for reference, i am a 32c with athletic shoulders. overall...

1,"Lovely dress This is such a cute dress, and i don't know why know one has reviewed it yet. its different and fun, i have worn it to work once and have gotten several compliments on it. i found that it does run a bit short so i wore it with leggings."
1,Adorable dress This dress is so cute and unique. i got many compliments when i wore it to an event recently and i know it will be a great summer dress. it definitely runs small and short on me. i am usually a 2/4 and needed a 6 in this dress.
1,"All-season perfection I bought this dress after eyeing it up for weeks - it's really stunning. the red is incredibly vibrant, especially for linen, and the construction is very high-quality. since it's linen, it feels crisp and light, and you can layer it up nicely with a pullover or roll up the sleeves for flat-out hot days. the rayon slip is a really nice touch, too, since the linen is fairly transparent. it really drove home the sense of quality for me. i bought mine in size 0-regular, which i found slightly big i"
1,"Classy! So i tried this on in the store and ended up with the size 8 (almost could have gone with a size 6) even though i'm 135lbs 5'6"" and 34 c. the dress is beautiful! the color is exactly as pictured - brilliant red. the linen is nice and summery. it does make it billow just a tad in the back because of the fabric but not anything to complain about. if i could change just one thing on this dress it would be the length. it just feels a little short for being such a classic and classy dress; just needs"
0,Too short for work This dress looked really nice on the hanger but when i put it on it was shorter than expected. i am 5'9 and it hit way above the knees. too short to be a work dress which was what i was hoping. might work better on someone shorter.
0,"Cute print, but didn't fit quite right This was such an adorable print that even though it was a bit pricey i decided to splurge! alas, the fit just wasn't good. it didn't look good on me and bunched up in all the wrong places. sadly, i had to return it. i've bought swimsuits from seafolly before and recommend the brand due to the high quality, unfortunately this particular style just didn't look that good on me."
1," Love the suit! i ordered two sizes, and this 6 ended up being too small. i'm 35x27x36 and 34d, and there wasn't enough support in the bust. read a lot of mixed reviews regarding sizing on the seafolly suits, so i'm glad i got two. suit is flattering and i love the coverage in the bottom. some boyshort suits are ""cheeky,"" but these are not like that. only complaint is that while there is a pocket for the cups, they are sewn on top."
1,"Lovely dress Dress is made from a light-weight linen and is lined with a separate slip. high quality with nice details and tts. sleeves are average length. length of dress feels appropriate on my 5'8"" frame. hook-and-eye closure at chest area to keep buttons aligned is a quality detail. i think this is a lovely dress that can go from work to play."
1,"Cute style! Dress is darling and well made. however, it runs very large. i tried to size down but then it became a little short in xsp. would be great for taller slim women. the style is so cute. the online picture does not do it justice."
0,"Gorgeous print, but unflattering fit The model makes this dress look amazing, but it didn't translate that way on me. the print is really beautiful, i loved that, but the waist is huge and the skirt part is a-line and full, not streamlined like it looks on the model. if it was more like that this dress would be a hit. but, sadly, it's a miss. this is something your mom would love on you, but few others."
1,Confidence builder I am 9 months post baby and still have some body self-confidence issues. i am just not ready nor do i think i want to ever wear a two piece again so i was looking for something that was still made me feel attractive. this swimsuit does the trick. makes me chest looks awesome and my tummy super flat. love this suit!!!
0,"Not at all like picture This dress is a potato sack! from the picture i thought it was going to be a cute drop waist dress but the tailoring is so weird!! and it's huge on me, so maybe it would be better if i sized down but again based on the tailoring i think not. also the fabric is strange, not at all what i expected. i'm so sad :( i was really excited about this dress."
1,In love I am 5'3 and tried this dress on in both a large and medium petite. the dress is supposed to be a lose fit but i found that i was swimming in the large but the medium was perfect. i bought it in a petite which is shorter for my comfort to wear alone but looks great with leggings and sandals for spring or with boots in the winter. the embroidery is beautiful plus it has pockets. first time i wore it i received tons of compliments.
1," I think the description and image might be slightly misleading and is giving this dress a bad name...it's not a drop waist dress as indicated in the description. it's a swingy a line silhouette- more fitted in the bodice and swingy as it its bells at the hem- which i find flattering. another discrepancy is that the brand is hd in paris, not glamorous. however i happened to find an online return at my local store and liked the print so i tried it on and fell in love with the 60s retro vibe and pr"
1,"So flattering! I've been stalking this suit online for months and i saw it in store yesterday. i never knew what size to order because of the australian sizing. i went with my pants size (8) and it looks great. i carry my weight in my butt and thighs and the boy legs are flattering! i found the size up (10) was loose in the bust for me. go for it, it's the cutest suit ever."
1, This dress runs a bit small in my opinion. for reference i'm a 36/38 c and usually a 10. the medium is tight at the bust. the material is beautiful but it looks like a petite cut on me. the sleeve and overall length are too short and i'm going to return it.
1,"Flattering I had the seafolly garden suit last year (same cut) and loved it. i decided the light blue color didn't look great on me so i decided to get this one. i found that the garden suit was cut smaller than this umbrella print one. right now i'm a 10 m and got the 12 in this, just like last time. i probably could've gotten the 10 but i'll keep the 12 for comfort. note: the leg holes are not tight and do not make upper thighs/butt squish out like you might imagine. try this suit!"
1,"Unique fox skirt Love this gorgeous fox skirt. i typically wear either a size 4 or 6 depending on cut. i bought the small and it fit perfectly. i wore it with a black turtleneck sweater and black tights/boots. other colored tops would work, as well, due to the various flower colors around the fox - pink, yellow, blue, white or brick red. i'd prefer it to be a little warmer/lined."
1," I love this tee, the fabric is very comfortable and the v-neck is not too deep for petites!"
1,"Favorite summer dress! I wore this dress yesterday and was complemented wherever i went and asked where i purchased the dress. i love the linen and the back of the dress is so flattering. i ordered a medium and could have gone with a small, which i usually never wear, so i would order a size smaller."
1,"Perfect, unless you're busty This dress is incredible on - better than the photos. the only problem is i am too busty to wear it bra-less or with a bandeau. if you don't have that problem, this is the perfect spring dress."
1,"Best purchase in a long time! I love everything about this dress. it is comfortable, classic, good quality and fits really well. there are two layers to the material so nothing is see through.the styling on the back is to die for. there is a subtle gold line that runs through the blue and white stripes. the first day i wore this i received 5 compliments while shopping in a single store!

it is a bit loose in the middle, but i paired it with a skinny belt and it was the perfect fix. i can usually wear petite or regular. i p"
1,"Beautiful but not exactly as pictured This is a beautiful, well made skirt that flows over curves beautifully. my only complaint is that the picture shows the purple lining showing through the tulle and the waistband having a purplish hue. the skirt i received is completely black and the lining doesn't show through purple at all."
1,"Perfect summer dress I purchased this dress in my regular size xs. i'd come across it several times at my local store but never thought much of it to try it on. . when i saw it was on sale i decided to take a chance. boy was i surprised. the dress is really beautiful.. the hints of gold reflect nicely.. the dress is comfortable and loose yet flattering. i received so many compliments on it. i am 5'1"" and the regular length worked for me."
1,Both my teen daughter and i love this dress I was using my daughter's dress and ended up buying myself one as well. it is a versatile casual dress... very flattering. (and my daughter and i have different builds) i actually wish that they sold this in more colors.
1,Delightful dress! I've gotten many compliments with this delightful dress. colors ar light and just right for a summer day. so comfortable and has a nice inner lining. very light and comfortable.
1,"Great for weekend I saw this dress several times and never try it. then i finally put it on. omg, i love it! it does run large. i am usually medium. but the small size is perfect on me i visually like the blue color. but the orange one is cuter on me. the length is great. i am 5'4''. it's right to my lower ankle. so i don't need to wear heel. the quality is very good. it's a great weekend dress."
1,"Beautiful, comfortable, flattering dress I am petite and curvy and usually need a dress with a seamed waistline, so i was a bit hesitant in ordering this when it went on sale, but i trusted the other reviewers who said it was flattering to women with curves. they were right! the way it's seamed vertically at the waist makes up for the lack of horizontal seaming and the result is that it's incredibly flattering. the fabric is light enough for warm weather, though it may be too heavy for hot weather. it's soft and has a very flattering n"
1,"Gorgeous print It's the print that attracted me when i was in the store. it is beautiful, but i fear it demands darker skin and hair. if you have problems with yellow, then don't buy. i don't mind the transparency of the fabric because it is not noticeable if you wear a flesh colored cami underneath. because the fabric is light and the shape boxy, it is meant to be flowing, so i purchased my regular size. if you have small breasts you would probably prefer a smaller size. i only wish the blouse had been a litt"
1,"Perfect for summer nights I was very impressed upon receiving this dress. i'm 5'3, 102lbs and ordered xs. fit perfect. i am also a 32dd, so if you are smaller than a d or big c, the top portion might be a little big for you. love how it is lined so you could technically wear without a bra. i bought the tangerine and have gotten many complements."
1,"Basic everyday joggers I just purchased these joggers on-line during the sale and bought them in my usual size small and they fit me tts. i'm 5""4"" and just bought the regular and the length on me is perfect. these aren't super thick or anything so i think they'll do just fine during the spring and summer months when i just need a pair of pants to put on really quick or just to lounge around in. i find these quite comfortable and like that they have pockets too."
1,Mango is mine!!! I love the cut of this dress! i have to be honest and say that i initially bought the blue color at the store and after falling in love i decided that i deserved to have the mango colored one as well after seeing my sister in it! the sizing is just a tab big but it works for the design. so i would say stick with your usual size. amazing pop of color especially for summer. the back design is gorgeous and the gold streaks running through it  are wonderful. do yourselves a favor and just try it on!
1,"Love - loose fit The back of this dress is stunning. i am usually a petite but could get away with regular. tried on xs (115 lbs, 30dd chest) and it was good length and not too low cut. colors are really fun, the mango one has a tiny bit of sparkle in one of the lines. flory and airy."
1,"Great! I love these pants so much and have worn them so many times in a week! they are comfy and causal, but still chic and presentable. these pants run true to size and are great for so many things- running errands, working out, lounging around, being casual and cool, etc., etc, etc! after buying these on sale, and loving them, i knew i needed more and purchased two more pairs. i definitely recommend these for anyone who wants both comfort and style."
1,"Runs big Thin rayon material. see-through and unlined. size down as this runs large. for reference, i'm 5'4, 124lbs size 26 in jeans. in retailer clothing, i wear sz small or size 4-6. i ordered this in small, but the body and shoulders are too wide and unflattering especially with the shorter length of this top. that is why sizing is key. i know it is meant to fit loosely, but you will have to order a size down otherwise you will look larger and the dark piping details on this top will not fall in the rig"
1,"Showstopper I wore these pants for the first time yesterday to two parties. before anyone asked for my name, they complimented me on the pants. my husband loved it, my friends loved it, and people i didn't know loved it. it's worth every penny i paid for it. i bought these pant to bring on my trip to italy later this summer."
1,"White openwork wide-legs Absolutely love the cut and design of these pants! fit so well and unique pattern at the ankle however, as is the case with many white pants, so disappointed when i tried them on at home and could see my underwear (nude color!) the pants are beautiful in every way except that they need to be lined! going back - may order the black since they're not likely to be ""see through!"" disappointing! was hoping to wear them to a dinner party!"
1, Pretty white pants with nice design at the bottom of the legs. had to have them hemmed a little.
1,"Wide ruffled pinstripe buttondown I did not have the issue that a previous reviewer did, there were ruffles on my shirt. the one thing i didn't know was how wide the top ran. i ordered my usual size 8 and it fit with no problems. i'm a 36b. the only thing is that in the model shot, the shirt is tucked into the pants and you don't get to see the full volume of it. even the model shot of the shirt from the back doesn't show the wide sleeves and body of the shirt. its not a big problem, since the shirt can be tucked but i will have"
1,"Love this top Great, flattering fit, lovely light fabric, classy with an edge. getting another one the other color! stripes on the taupe one are navy -"
1,"Lovely, perfect I am a shorter woman (5'3"") and typically a size large. i purchased this dress in a large. it is flattering and fits well. good length as well."
1,"One of my favorites!! I absolutely love everything about this top! i got compliments the first time i wore it. i do not find the fabric to be sheer at all, but perfectly lightweight for the heat of summer. the neckline and sleeves seem tailor-fitted for my body. i don't often think much about sleeves but these sleeves are the perfect length/shape to be incredibly flattering. they're in a sweet spot somewhere in between a cap sleeve and regular-length. the neckline is equally perfect and hugs my curves beautifully wit"
1,Really cute but runs large I'd wish i'd gotten this in a small.. i'm a true medium and its pretty big on me. that being said i still love it and will continue to wear it. the v part of the neck lays kind of funny after washing. i might try to sew it down.
0,"Beautiful dress, not for me I hated to send this dress back, but my busty and curvy figure looked bigger and rounder in this dress. sent it back. it is meant for taller and more slender women."
1,"More petites & asymmetrical stripes, please! This is already sold out in petites and the reason for this is asymmetrical stripes: this is the most flattering design for tops. horizontal stripes only look good on people trying to look bigger and heavier. do you know anyone like that, b/c i don't! vertical stripes, while slimming, generally look a little severe, modern, weird (occasionally great), while asymmetrical stripes knock 5lbs off a person. stock more asymmetrical striped tops, please!"
1,"Many compliments about this dress! This is a great dress that looks better in reality than it shows on the website. the style is very flattering, fitting snug at the waist with just the right amount of flare. i am 132 pounds, 34dd and i bought a size 8 and it fit great. the material is soft and flowing and the cut was true to size for me. the first time i wore it a woman walked across the restaurant to tell me how much she loved my dress. this one is a keeper."
1,"Lightweight and pretty summer pants I bought these in white (not a harsh white, more soft-looking), and am very pleased with them. they are true to the manufacturer's sizing (i own another pair of pants from elevenses in the same size), which runs somewhat large (i'm 5' 5"" tall, weigh 135 pounds, and the size 6 fit perfectly). the back of the waistband is elasticized, so there's some give. they're long enough on me that they hit the floor; with heels, they're perfect. they look as pictured, but what you can't tell from the photo i"
1," This dress fit perfectly and as i am a bit curvy the style compliments my figure. it is a bit fuller in the bottom than the photo looks. also, i am 5'4"" and it is a right to the bottom of my knees which is also very complimentary."
0,Bulky I am 5 '5 and 119 pounds with an athletic cury body type. the dress wore bulky and ran large at size 2.
1,"Size down I first tried this dress in my usual size 4, and thought it was a pretty fabric but boring and not particularly flattering.  i later read the positive reviews and the next time i was in the store i tried it in a 2, and it was so much better!  very pretty shape.  uiu might want to size down because the shoulders were set a little wide apart and bodice was gapping in my usual size.  for reference, i'm 5'6"", 125 lbs."
1," Twirly full skirt!
me: 5'6"", 130lbs, 34/35a-28-36. tried and pictured the size 6, a perfect fit with a bit of give in the bust for a larger cup size.
i'm not particularly curvy and i felt this added a waistline to me, i think this is an almost universally flattering cut.
material was soft and an easy wear.
simple enough that i think it will wear for quite a few years."
1,"Fun tee! I love this tee. i am long waisted and so many tops right now that are on the shorter side look silly on me so i was happy to find this. i'm 5' 5"" 118, 34b and bought and xs. it fits perfectly. the asymmetry is darling and the stripes are perfect for spring. it is a nice weight and i felt totally worth the money. it looks great so far after three washes and hang dries."
0," This dress is nice colors and well made but it's just not the style for me. it almost fits frumpy. i'm not sure that a belt would even make it look good. also being 5'8, it is shorter than i'd wear. i like at least touching top of the foot for a maxi."
1," So versatile
i tried this on in my usual regular 0, but it was way too long at the shoulders, large in the bust(i am 32b), and a tad too long overall. i ordered the 0p and it fits perfectly! can wear this year round and looks great with or without a belt. pockets would have made it even better, but still love it."
1,"Cute top This top runs a little large. i should probably return for a smaller size but figure after i wash it, it'll shrink a bit. it's very flattering on and i really like the asymmetrical design. the only thing i don't like about it is that the fabric is a little itching without wearing a tank top underneath."
1,"Adorable dress The picture does not do it justice. this dress is beautiful on. it is fitted on the top and flares on the bottom. it is also a very soft denim. the person helping me at the store brought a sparkly belt that made it even more spectacular. truth is it looks great with or without the belt. it fits true to size (5'4"", 135 lbs and 34c and my usual size 2 was great)."
1," Product is sheer, but definitely adorable w/ any jean product! wouldn't pay full price but so glad i got it on sale w/ extra savings!!!"
1,"Gorgeous summer dress I bought this on sale and absolutely love it. i bought the xs, i'm 5'10, 145 lbs and a b/c cup and it fit well. i am considering sewing in cups, since i don't like using stick-on bras as much and none of my other bras work with the back. that really is my only complaint about the dress, everything else is great!"
1,"Cute..some considerations I like this dress. i did have to return one for a regular from a petite size 8. normally i wear a size 6 in retailer dresses but since i have a large bust (34dd) i wanted to account for the needed room. with the petite the bust was not so much a problem as the ribcage, which was too tight. it is still fitted in the regular size 8, but doable. the 6 would have been impossible. i am aware that i have a slightly larger ribcage so i was not completely surprised. the other reason that i did not give th"
1,"Flattering and feminine I was on the fence about another patchwork design peasant inspired blouse, but once i tried this on i fell in love. it drapes beautifullly, is not too short, and just feels pretty. for reference i am 5 feet 6 inches, 140 lbs. 36b and usually wear a medium in tops. the medium fits and flows perfectly, hiding all my mature woman problem areas.
i purchased quite a few items on the 40% off sale, and this is one of my top favorites. i love the versatility, just gorgeous for casual wear or dressy."
1,Classy with a twist. Love these pants. very flattering. not much stretch. the rear waist band is elastic with minimal stretch and not visible to others. they are long but wearable with the right heels.
1,Comfortable wardrobe staple I just wore these and they were comfortable and didn't stretch our or become baggy throughout the day. i have three kids and am constantly moving. they're a nice in between weight and held up nicely. i have some from j.crew that stretch out and become baggy in the knees and backside and these didn't do that. i usually wear an 8/10 and i purchased a medium and they fit well. i would say that run a little big though.
1,"Sexy This is a very sexy suit. it took some time to figure out how to put it on. it needs instructions, but it is well worth it."
1,"At last! I picked this maxi up in navy to go with my summertime capsule wardrobe that i will be doing extensive travel with this summer. this dress is well made and fits my frame in a size m perfectly (5'4, 125lbs, 34c). it is substantial enough to disguise any backside indiscretions and the halter style front does not expose the girls. i do wear petals with this dress to ensure that i don't put on a show especially in air conditioned rooms. this launders easily and doesn't look rumpled and wilted after"
1,New go to tee Not tissue thin like most tees and easily can be dressed up to wear to work in a casual setting. i find myself reaching for this tee weekly! have every color! i usually avoid stripes however this tee seems to flatter and slim! love!
1,Foxy!!! I absolutely loooove this skirt! its just as depicted. super comfy and warm. got tons of compliments wearing it. its just adorable. the colors are really rich and the design if the skirt made it avery flexible to wear with different styles of tops and sweaters. highly recommend!!
1,"Unusual and gorgeous This print combination is like an arts and crafts wallpaper sampler, and is simply beautiful. size down and tuck it in for the best look, but wear a high-waist bottom with it, since it runs a bit short.in the torso.i didn't find the same transparency problem of which other reviewers complain."
1,"Wow, a flattering shape for my young 70 yr self! I am 70 years old and enjoy retailer so much for uniqueness.
this dress is not flattering in the photo..but.....
it is great on a curvy figure and i plan to wear it anywhere/everywhere i can....so flattering
from the bust to the smaller waist (though mine is definitely not small) but the skirt then
flares deligthfully. the fabric is not heavy, not too light ...just great.
easy going length...wear as is or add a crop, belt, etc....

again, the photo does not do this dress justice!!!!"
1,"What i expect retailer to sell! amazing! Gorgeous skirt. received so many compliments. the colors are perfect to match with many tops/jackets/sweaters....as well as different shoes/boots, bringing out the colors. i unfortunately ordered a large thinking it ran small and the large is too big in the waist so i will try to have it tailored. i like my skirts fuller in the hip area. i hope retailer offers more of this type of item. just adore it! for size i am a 8/10 in bottoms but since the skirt looked slim with out lining i ordered a large"
1,Well made daily dress I love love love this dress..it's a quality well fitting jean dress..that you can dress up or down..the top portion dies run small..so of you are busy you might want to stay away from this dress..
1,"Amazing! These pants are elegant and chic. great for tall women. wearing to a yacht cruise, can't wait! would have loved to wait for the sale, but i had to have them and i am very pleased."
0,"What happened! I have never had a purchase go wrong at retailer, which is why i am was not hesitant to spend this much money on the blazer. however, the quality is very poor - it feels like it might fall apart after one clean. also, the buttons where not sewn on properly. i wear an xs and the size was a good fit, but the overall quality was not worth the price (or even close to it)."
1,"Love these but too long for petite Love these pants. ordered in petite .,love style, great fit but so long . 
keeping but have to get hemmed 2 1/2 inches. 
decided to order the black & green as well."
1," Size down as the top looks too big at the shoulders of you get your normal size. i don't find the material  too see through. it's light, flowy and pretty. not your average boring looking top. unique."
0,"White needs lining These pants are so adorable and fit perfectly (long enough even on my 5'10 frame) but i was forced to return because the white color is completely see through, even with nude panties. you can still clearly see them. so disappointed."
0,Unhappy with purchase I ordered this pants in white and black. i read the reviews and weren't that bad. i am 5'6 and 125 lbs. i got them in size small. they are way too big. the small size seems to be xl and they are way too long for someone who is maybe 5'8 or 5'9. i have to returned them. quality is ok looking on my opinion.
0," Loved the fit and colors, but the fabric is very thin and see-thru. i tried a nude cami underneath and the cami was completely visible. it did not look appropriate for anything that i wanted to wear the top to."
1,Flattering all around This dress has all the hallmarks of a classic. the fit of the bodice is form enhancing but modest and the flare is very feminine and swingy. i love the soft denim fabric though it smelled funny out of the package and i had to air it out. i am 140# 36dd and bought the size 8.
1,Short but great with high rise pants This shirt was a little shorter than i hoped but definitely too boxy if i had ordered up in size. i ordered xs based on reviews i usually wear a s. it looks great with higher rise jeans or dress pants.
1,"Your classic plaid blazer w/ patch elbows I have always liked this look so ordered my usual size s. fit is good & looks pretty much on me as in the pic - even the arm length works - not too long. i don't care for the placement of the top buttons which are just cosmetic. they dangle downwards showing more of the loop than the button itself. placement is not directly over the bottom buttons, which puts it in the lower breast area. mmmmm... not the look i want. looks unattractive. if i keep this, i will have to move the buttons more in lin"
0,"Maybe not great for a petite Was excited to receive this dress, as it had some great reviews. however, of the love was coming from the 5'5""+ set. as a petite, this didn't work well for me, and the fabric flattened me out in the bust in an awkward way. returned."
1,"Comfortable, flattering dress If you are curvy, this dress is for you. every details is flattering, from the seams to the fit-and-flare cut. true to size. this dress will easily cross seasons. love it!"
1,Great dress! This dress is gorgeous. it is a perfect fit and very flattering.
1,"Smart, stylish, can go dressy or casual Love these pants! thank you retailer for making ""tall"" really tall! i am 6 feet and have to wear heals keep the pants from dragging- love it! i got the black- not 'shear.' they run just a tad small. i am a 4/6 in pants and the 6t just fit me. 
i wear with a tank for casual, beach look; colorful silk top for a dressier look- very versatile. 

i just may have to buy this in the green. (i would get the white, but some reviews say they are pretty shear."
1,Great top! Fits perfectly! i don't think this is too long and i'm a shorty. great style -- wish it came in more colors - i would definitely buy again!
1,Wash carefull I love this shirt. i wore it once and it is so cute on - the problem came from washing. i washed once and made sure i washed on gentle. i took it out of the washer and hung it to dry and noticed that there was now a tiny hole in the body of the shirt. i am planning to exchange this and hoping it doesn't happen again!
1,"Love this shirt! I ordered this shirt in both white and coral. i absolutely love the design and coral color. the white was a bit see through, so i returned it. it would be cute with a cami under, but i just wanted something that did not require an extra layer. overall, it is a flattering fit and i love the detail on the back."
1,"So close... This is a fantastic sweater--really soft, great details. but it's huge. i'm generally between an xs and a s at retailer, and most always an xs with pure + good. but this time even the xs is huge! i wish they offered this one in an xxs. i love it so much that i may keep it anyway? it's really comfortable and i love the style. looks decent with my arms down (like the model's pose), but when my arms are lifted out to either side, it really looks huge. i'll have to think on this one."
1,"Classic tee with flirty details This shirt is incredibly soft! i was drawn to the style based on the feel of the material and the cute tie up detailing in the back. definitely size down. the sleeves were a little snug, but sizing down will help with the length and the bust. my only problem with this shirt is that if you bend over, anyone can see down your top. so be aware! otherwise, the top is great and perfect for summer."
1,"The perfect jeans! I am obsessed with these jeans! i have them in 3 washes and hardly ever wear any of the other jeans in my closet now. they are truly the perfect skinny jeans. you can dress them up with heels and a cute top, or down with a slouchy sweater and boots, or even throw on with a simple tee and flats. i love that they are low rise, as i am short waisted, and often find the front rise too long on many styles. the backside is also super flattering, and the back pockets are the perfect size and shape...no"
1,Nice wardrobe staple The material is soft and the length is great. you can wear it with short or skinny jeans. the only drawback is the color because it is so light. it is pastel so if you like pastels it will be great for you.
1,"Looks like pajamas, tight in the underarms I really liked the look of this top online, but when it came i had a couple of issues with it. first, when i tried it on i found the underarms to be a little snug (i normally wear a 10/m, and that's what i ordered). it makes raising my arms tough, and as a teacher, i need to be able to lift my arms above my waist. secondly, my husband's first reaction was that it ""looks like pajamas."" the abstract floral/stripe gets a little lost.

on the other hand, the color palette is very pretty and the qual"
1,"Soft & warm Beautiful medium weight duster; it looks just like on line photos!
my store did not have this duster so i ordered on line. i usually wear a medium top, but sometimes a large.
i'm 5'7"", 140 lbs, and i don't like my tops tight.
i ordered this duster in xl because i like room in my cardigans; i could have gone with a large.
i have to roll up the cuffs of the sleeves, but i like to do that anyway.
this sweater duster is soooo soft and warm! so comfy! very stretchy with no closures on the front."
1,"Cute but... I ordered this top because i liked the look in the back, however, the top i received looks nothing like the back. online it shows that the back has elastic & is gathered. also online it shows thin straps (that look like a bra strap) but my top has no thin straps & no elastic~ extremely odd!! i called customer service but the lady i spoke to didn't have any information or complaints about the top. i'm holding on to the top because it is cute from the front, but i was really wanting the back to lo"
1,"Love this but there are some flaws I absolutely adore this top. the design on the front is super bright and beautifully done, so beware if you do not like bright colored patterns. i normally wear a size medium and bought a large in this shirt because of reading other reviews, i am glad i did so. i have broad shoulders and muscular arms, and i believe a medium would not have fit my arms and shoulders. however, it is a little boxy in the torso area because of the extra material. therefore, i feel a large feels like a medium in the"
1,"New favorite wardrobe staple! Yes, $48 may feel like a lot to pay for a tshirt, but this is one is worth it -- i can wear this with *everything*! i bought this in grey, and the quality and style are just right to pair with a high waisted skirt or black skinny pants to wear out at night, or wear with regular jeans and a cardigan during the day. one of the best retailer purchases i've made in a while!"
0,"Cute design, poor quality For starters, the back pictured on the website is not true to the actual back of the shirt. the small traps are not there and it isn't gathered in the exact same way. the big bow is adjustable and overall i really loved the fit of the top, but the difference in design is not something i would expect from retailer. my shirt also got a hole in it along the seam in the back after washing once. although i liked the look of the top, the quality is not what i'm used to from retailer."
1,"Great top Love this top, the flutter sleeves are really pretty and give the top a bit more pizzazz than just being a regular tee. it makes it easy to dress up or down. the length is great, not super long but not too short. i ordered a medium and it fits well, not tight and isn't baggy, the material allows it to float away from the body a bit and doesn't feel stretched over my belly :) or anything. nice silky weight."
1,"Love the design Love the design of these pants and they are super comfortable. perfect for running errands but managing not to look like you just rolled out of bed. bought the regular m size (usually i want petite because i'm 5'1"") and while they are a little long they still fit relatively well"
1,"Colors not great on me.,.. I bought three of these tees. i kept the turquoise one only though. the color was pretty - a little drab but not too bad. 

 i love the style., the fabric is so soft and the one i wore was super comfy. the sleeves are cute without being too dramatic (like the ruffle sleeve tee - the sleeves were kind of ridiculous on me) 

now - the cons - the colors are pretty drab. i normally look better in more vibrant colors. the ""red"" i bought made me look like a corpse. it's not pretty at all. can't re"
1,"Very soft, comfortable top I just got this top in store today. all the colors were ""heathered "", pretty casual colors. the top is extremely soft and i would say true to size. love the flutter sleeves that give nice feminine details.  i hope it doesn't shrink in the wash and wears well! also, i found that the purple color seemed to run slightly smaller than the others? kind of odd, but i thought worth mentioning:)"
1,"Cute but It was a little on the thinner side (fabric), a little more sheer that i would have liked. i actually prefer that it doesn't have the straps in the back, i didn't order it before until i read the reviews. fit loosely. the shirt is comfortable, and the back is beautiful (love bows), tbu the front was just ordinary. for the price, even on sale, i didn't feel i absolutely needed it, but if you are looking for a hite tank, it is pretty cute. (ivory, not pure white).

xs: 115 lbs, 60 dd."
1,"Cute enough As far as t-shirts go, this one is fun, i love the lace up detail in the back. the xs regular fit nicely (115 lbs, 30dd), the shirt flares out (swing), so it can be a little much on the smaller gals, but it was ok enough on me that the stylist decided to try it on too. the orange color was pretty, but i decided to pass as i have a lot of orange tops... and that is the color that was most flattering on my skin. amterial is on the thinner side and a little tiny sheer, must be the trend..."
0,"Doesn't fit well sized down This tee was meant to be loose and swishy, but as it runs large, sizing down means the sides come up really high, as they curve a good 3-4"" higher up. so your waistband is exposed, and it just doesn't look nice:( returned an xs and small."
1,Cute shoulders and pretty color I bought the mauve color and it's very pretty. i felt as though sizing up was a better choice. i'm usually an xs or a small and i went with the small. i liked the length of the small better. the shoulders add a cute look to it.
1," Cure pants --- just bought them ---
they look black but the description says ""blue motif"" - does anyone else have them and know
if they are black or blue?"
1,"Great tee! I bought the lavender in my normal large. the fabric drapes wonderfully and does not cling to my midsection. the texture of the fabric is much more interesting than the photos online show. there is beautiful shimmer tot he heather in the color. in my lavender shirt there is pink/gray/lavendar/white/silver depth to the fabric. i plan on getting at least two more colors. 

i recommend washing all shirts like this in a nylon bag in the machine, then line drying. i have done this for years with al"
1,"Expectations met! Wow, this sweater is, as other reviewers have said, perfect weight and the colors are vibrant and will work well with fall colors! i'm 5'11"" so i'm always hoping the length works and in this case it does! i am very happy with this!"
1,"Great piece! Agreed that the pictures do not do this top justice. it's got shiny threads woven in the fabric and gives off an iridescent, colorful sheen. it can be dressed up or down, worn with a number of various styles - jeans, dress pants, skirts. the back adn arms are a tweed sweater knit, the front is an unforgiving acetate - dry clean only - hand wash will ruin this piece! i normally wear a small, but it was tight in the chest (34c) so i went with a medium and it worked fine.) no stretch in the acetate"
1,"Fun, versatile piece Very well made and comfortable with nice finishing touches and fabric. looking forward to wearing it many different ways either with jeans, pants or long dresses. i'm 5'1 and petite sizes were out of stock so i chose small regular which looks great, not too long so i won't have to shorten."
0,"Very poor quality I ordered this top in white along with the meadow rue lace sleeve top. while they are the same price, they aren't even close in quality. this top is one of the sheerest tops that i have seen. the trim, pocket and the lace-up tie are made from sheer type material that was twisted and didn't lay right, and the tag sewn inside, was sewn with red thread and showed through, very visible. i don' t think it would hold up after many washes. i returned this one and ordered another color in the lace sleev"
1,"Perfect tee but beware of blue!! I purchased this tee last week in white and love it! as soon as i saw that it was on sale i ran to get a price adjustment and to pick up a few more colors! i had every intention to grab up the blue today however i tried on four larges and all were cut way shorter than the other colors. i ended up purchasing the red which fits exactly as my white one does. perfect light weight, easy, but adorable tee for summer!"
1,"Pretty fabric, ok fit This skirt is a really beautiful print and made of a lovely silky fabric. i didn't have the ""see-through"" issue that the other reviewer mentioned, my main concerns were the length (i'm 5'1 and it almost goes to my ankles) and that it poofs out a little right below the waist band. i'm between a small and a medium and went with the small. it fits but i wonder if it would lie flatter and be more flattering if i had gone with a medium instead."
1," Perfection. effortless cool, and the colors are much more vibrant and gorgeous in person. endless options. you know a sweater must be a dream if you end up buying it when it's still 90 degrees outside. runs true to size---the medium fit with room to layer underneath."
1,"Really unique top Really interesting, beautiful colors. i found it to be short, even in the regular size (and i'm 5'1 with a short torso). wish the fit was slimmer, but i could see it working with jeans, or being stunning with a black ball skirt."
1, Bought all colors and each one is unique in its beauty. material is thicker than most thin tops today but not too thick for the summer. i wear size 12/14 and the xl fit with room to spare. i bought larger in case of shrinkage.
1,"Cute spin on a basic tee It's thin, very. but i were a cute scrappy athletic type bra underneath and it's so cute!
it's a stink top, i pick a spot to tuck in around the from and let the rest flow.
aside from being a swing top, it runs large. i have 2 in xs and i'm a 34dd and i still have room.
i have it in faded red/pink and white and am buying blue too, love it!"
1,"Grabbed it in the store! I didn't pay much attention to this shirt on the website...when i was in the store yesterday though, i grabbed the green color because it's so pretty! i went back home to see which shirt this was on the website and was surprised. the picture here really doesn't do it justice. it's very soft, has a beautiful and flattering necklace and the flutter sleeves hang nicely rather than puffing out (like snow white...which isn't my goal!). also, because the sleeves drape nicely, you could wear it under s"
0,"Not as expected I ordered this in a l online, and wasn't a fan when i received it. the colors are pretty bright, but they also look cheap in my opinion. it also had an awkward fit, because of the material there is no give at all, it was really tight on my chest (36d) for reference. and it was also pretty short, and i'm short! it barely hit the top of my pants...and i'm 5'2! back it went."
1," I absolutely love this top. it can be worn with shorts or jeans, dressed up or down. it fits perfectly, i am broad on top so i ordered a large. i bought it in white..i wish they had more colors. love it."
1,"Colors are very pretty... This duster is very nicely put together and is mid-weight. i'm not sure it's worth this price point but it's not cheaply made, either. the colors are as shown on the website to a 't'. the length is also as shown. i am 5'5 142 lbs and 34d and the small is perfect. i think if one is considering multiple layers underneath a medium would serve the purpose nicely but the small will accommodate a blouse or tee underneath and is just perfect. colors are dark teal, salmon and gold. this is a three seaso"
1,Stylish and comfortable I bought this top in every color. the fit is so flattering and just flows so nicely - not too big. love!
1,"Love these leggings! I saw these in the store and was smitten. ordered online and have not been disappointed. love the pattern, the feel, and the fit. comfortable, fun and interesting. the regular length ones are definitely full-length on me but not too long. i might have gone with the petite length except that they didn't seem available, but am perfectly happy with the regular length."
1,Sleeves a plus If you are self conscious about your arms and want a tee that has style then this is the one. soft fabric with a flutter sleeve makes this top so flattering. i purchased the turquoise and will purchase other colors. it's flowy comfortable and a must have!
1,"Very cute These pants are great, super cute and comfy. the price is too high but i do love them."
1,"Pretty color and pattern combination, boyish style The colors and textures on this top are fun. however, the boxy shape isn't very flattering and poofs out a bit around the belly. maybe it would look a bit more feminine on someone with a curvier chest. i would size up if between sizes because the top part around the arms is not very roomy. i tried it on at the store but decided to pass because the xs was a little tight around the arms but the s billowed around the belly too much. still a cute piece if it works for you fit-wise."
1,"Original workout leggings These leggings were everything i expected them to be. they are well made, and the material is thick enough that i can wear them outside in the colder months of the year. the pattern on the website is accurate, and the waistband is comfortable and flattering. would definitely buy again!"
1,"Easy to wear This top is very easy to wear. it's a great, versatile, and unique piece. the textile is really soft and i found, quite special. it is pretty lightweight and the sleeves have some great stripes of more sheer fabric."
1,Beautiful duster I was fortunate to buy one of the last petite mediums in this style! the knit is soft and comfortable and doesn't seem likely to snag. there are a variety of stitches through the upper areas which add subtle differences. the colors are fantastic. this will be great for the cooler months. it looks fabulous with denim.
1,"Short and wide I ordered this in the blue, it's a beautiful shade of blue. love the lace up detail in the back, but the size small was just short and very wide. i understand it is a swing top, but this was not flattering on me. i'm short waisted, 34-d, 5'3, 125 lbs.  i'm sure it would be cute on a very thin person."
1,"Soft and stylish This tee fits true to size, not oversized. the material is super soft and the colors are delicate. the armholes don't show your bra which is hard to find. nothing bad to say about this top except that my size was sold out in every color but lavender (which was lovely!)."
1,"Statement leggings I am in love with theses! they are incredibly comfortable and flattering. i have an hourglass figure, and they hug my hips perfectly. they perfect for the gym, but also look great with a tunic and booties for fun weekend wear. good + pure are my new go to legging brand. i'm going to order the solid black and other patterns retailer has."
1,"Retailer at its best! On any given day, i can usually find tons of stuff i like at retailer, but every once in a while comes an item that is extra special.

it has adorable details, lovely print, fits beautifully and can't be found anywhere else. oh, and the quality is good. 

this top is it for me!

i love the print, and the sleeves remind me a bit of a kimono except that this top's fabric is smooth and flowy.

i tried the top in the store in a small, and i felt lost in the fabric (i am 5'4"", 115# and small on"
1, Just purchased this on sale. will be perfect for summer on those days you wear dresses and don't want your skin to touch the subway bench! love it!
1,"Unique statement sweater This sweater is so unique. not for the faint of heart but it's beautiful. hubby thought pattern looked southeast asian inspired. the colors are saturated, vibrant. love the raglan sleeves and the tweed on the sleeves and in the back. the front material is slightly stiffer. i feel like i have a little bit more bulk in the stomach area than i want but i'm willing to overlook it. will be a great sweater for the holiday season. wear it with a skirt, jeans, skinny cargos. endless possibilities."
1,Pretty print! Adorable print! just picked these up in the store yesterday! the print is so pretty and it caught my eye! surprisingly they fit in my usual size for workout pants!
0,"Just okay The sleeve detail is cute and well done. the fabric is nice quality, but the body of the shirt really doesn't have any shape."
1,"Very sheer Super flattering, a great length for me (5'9"") but very sheer."
1,"Love style, need different color I love this tshirt, but the speckled grey looks more like roof shingles in person. i'm going to try to exchange it for a different color."
1,"Second time's a charm While shopping with my daughters, i bought this tee in white. i immediately felt guilty for spending too much on a white tee that was thin and see-through enough that i'd need to wear something underneath. i returned the white, but then retailer had a sale weekend, so i ordered the blue with a discount, so less guilt and the color is beautiful. i don't need to worry about wearing anything underneath - the fabric is very thin and super soft and feels so nice."
0,"What a disappointment I should have read the reviews first before ordering this top/!. ***buyers beware**: you will not get the same top delivered to you, as is shown in this picture. the top i got delivered does not have the little straps at all, and while there is a bow in the back, the back sides do not come together the same to form the bow. i hate to write a bad review, but come on retailer! i'd never expect this from you. it looks like any other peplum white top, not something special like the picture is o"
1,"Best t-tshirt ever! I don't normally write reviews, but i love this shirt!  it's sooo soft and hangs perfectly. not to mention it takes what could be a boring t-shirt and makes it anything but that with the cute flutter sleeves. it's beyond comfortable. i purchased one and went back immediately to get another! i can tell these will be some of my go-to tees. plus, they are a steal on sale!  i am 5'5, 135 and medium is perfect."
1,"Very pretty blouse; sleeves impractical I normally wear an xl, but could only find this instore in size large. the blouse fits nicely, but i think it would come down a bit lower and also be a longer blouse if i would have purchased it in my usual size. the blouse itself has a nice drape to it. the black 'railroad tracks' look very pretty in person, and add a nice detail. the only complaint i have with this blouse is the sleeves. the enormous bell sleeve feels like a costume. but for a nominal fee i had the sleeves shortened to a ruffl"
1,"Leggings These are very well constructed, medium weight, besutiful leggings."
1,Best basic tee I bought this shirt in blue (because the store was out of gray and i had to have it right then) and it is my favorite. it is comfortable and durable. i also appreciate the length of the shirt. it is long enough for me to not worry about putting my arms up. it is an overall great buy. i want one in every color.
1,Cute - don't size down! Cute shirt. i thought from the model that it would be big so sized down. it's more snug than i expected so will send back and re-order in normal size. might order 1 size up and compare.
1," Really fantastic shirt. ordered multiple colors and will keep them all. the gray especially looks a bit boring online, but is gorgeous in real life. it has different shades mixed together and is really pretty. neckline is interesting. wish the front was a tad shorter, (i'm 5'4) but don't think petite will work. really, really great shirt."
0,"Top still too low on me Like the idea of this shirt so much. but the neckline was still way too low- the top of my bra was visible. wishing the under layer really covered as no way i'm going to another layer to an already layered shirt. might just be my body type, so might work for someone else, but sending back."
1,Like butter These leggings are so comfortable and luxurious.  when i opened the package i knew i was in trouble.  they are comfortable and beautiful.  a perfect piece for any wardrobe.
1,"Lovely simple staple I adore a well made and well fit tshirt. t.la always delivers! this one is no exception. fun, swingy and light. the tie on back is a fun little addition and the length is perfect. i'm 5'9 and always prefer longer tops. the swing in this one gives it a great length. love the colors but decided to stick with basic white. i'd love this in black too! highly recommend!"
1,"Nice top Like the other reviewers experienced, i received my top in the mail, and it does not have the straps as shown in the online pictures. not to say that the top is not attractive, though, and i'll be keeping it. very comfortable and cool in the triple-digit heat in my community."
1,"Worth the wait! I first saw these in store, but decided to risk waiting for them to go on sale and no regrets! they are a great high quality and the print is exactly what i hoped it to be!"
1,"Even more beautiful in real life The colors are really lovely--bright and vibrant. the sleeve and back fabric is comfortable and breathable. it is dry-clean only because of the brocade, but definitely worth it! i'm usually s but preferred the xs fit."
0,Disappointing I loved this t-shirt when i first tried it on: a good cut--not too drapey or fitted. but then i washed it (laid flat to dry) and it shrunk so much that it's unwearable now. so disappointing.
0,"Fabric too delicate I bought this shirt in 3 colors. soft, comfortable fabric, as other reviewers have mentioned, and nice detailed sleeve. i am gravely disappointed in the fabric quality since after wearing this one time with a necklace (as shown in the picture) it developed tiny pulls. i should mention that it was a very plain necklace, nothing sharp, pointy etc. i will most likely return all 3 shirts."
1,"Cute, breezy, comfy Great summer shirt, loose and casual. it's pretty flowy and not form-fitted at all. i almost always wear a petite xs in retailer, and that is what i got (i'm 5'4 and 125 pounds). fits great- loose and swingy, but is big (i like this). retailer, please get/restock petites for the pink color!"
1,"Feminine & perfect for spring My favorite leggings. they are feminine and perfect with a long tee. the colors are vibrant, the material is high quality, plus they're comfy! i ordered an xs. i'm 5'4"" and 115 lbs."
0, One wash wonder...i'm a s to m and went with a m but could have gone with a s with ease. after washing it was way shorter. it shrunk more than a whole size in cold water! i assumed everything came preshrunk but sadly disappointed. great for one wear.
1,Colorful sweater Great sweater for any occasion. may be dressed up and/or worn with jeans. very versatile. love that it is short sleeves. size is true to fit.
1,Forgot to review I don't know why i never reviewed this beauty. i love the colors and pleats and contrasting embroidery. i'm busty
1,"Great statement piece This is a beautiful and comfortable top. the brocade front panel is a nice take on a traditional pattern but in bright colors with a metallic sheen. the knit sleeves and back are a stretchy, nubby complement. overall, a great piece and perfect for the holidays."
1,"Great sweater & color! This appealed to me online & it came in petite. during the promo in july i decided i shld order the petite small while they lasted although way too hot to even consider wearing until fall. glad i did. i am short & the regular length wld be a bit too long. great color & quality. not too thick or weighty. like that it's a cotton blend. will go well with the many skinny jeans/cords/leggings i have. love the blue. now i have to wait a few months to wear it! 5'3"", 117# & usually wear a size small in"
1,"Great fit The colors on these leggings are very nice and the fit was fabulous. the waist is high enough to hold in a slight ""muffin"" top and the control in the fabric is just right. i received several compliments on them and hubby really liked them."
1,Great top! Love this top...bought in 2 colors...white and the orange. fun change to regular t-shirts....sized down because its flowy.
1,"Just what i wanted These pants are just what i wanted to work out in- something bright, cheery, and feminine. they're super comfortable and fit perfectly. i'm typically a 2, so i ordered the xs, and they are just right."
1,"Quality sweater This is a beautiful sweater with vibrant colors. it is versatile and can be worn throughout the year, it runs true to size and has become one of my favorite sweaters."
1,"Love it but runs small I love the print and design, the photo does not do it justice. i fell in love with it in the store but could not find my size. i ordered my size online but it was still small and short. it came up to my waist, and was tight in the shoulders and waist. i really wish it wasn't so small. i love love this top, the colors are vibrant and shiny, totally my style. i highly recommend it if it fits."
1,"Great summer staple Love this top! i have it in the green and i am tempted to go and buy it in the other colors! it is a simple, but cute top that is easy and comfortable to wear. a little dressier than a plain tee."
1,"Perfect peasant top This caught my eye in the store because of the beautiful bell sleeves so i had to try it on. i tried on an xs and small to see what fit better. for me, i am 5""3' and about 120 lbs, the xs fit better. i usually do take an xs in tops. i wore it out recently with a pair of distressed jeans and it looked great. as with most of the items you see online it is always better to see it in person as the pictures do not do it justice. the material was nice and flowy. i did not feel the neckline was too low"
1,"Lovely, buttery-soft and oh-so flattering I purchased the blue (a bluish gray), size medium.

the entire top, including the fluttery sleeves, drapes wonderfully and is sooo soft. i wish i could wear this top/this silhouette every day! it's versatile enough to do so, if only the other colors were flattering to my coloring. 

sleeves: i'm thrilled to find a shirt that fits/flatters my proportional curves and sports sleeves that don't grip my biceps. often, i must choose to fit my arms or fit my torso, unless i want the additional step"
1,"Feminine skirt I really like this skirt but unfortunately there is no lining, so it's a bit see through under the light. also there is no hook at the top of the zipper to secure the skirt. i just think that with this kind of price, the skirt should come at least with the lining. otherwise, it's beautiful skirt, flowy and very feminine."
1," This tunic is amazing. i'm not usually one for turtlenecks but it's not too tight around the neck and very comfortable. i love the versatility, it can be worn with pants/leggings or a skirt,  you can layer it with a shirt or blouse underneath or throw a jacket over it."
1,"Perfect top I was thrilled when this shirt arrived.  it is as cute in person as in the catalog.  it's soft, it fit perfect, and it looks great with shorts and pants.  it will be my ""go to"" shirt this summer."
1,Perfect flowy top I would describe as an upgraded t-shirt. a perfect flowy top that you can dress up or down. comfortable and soft material.
1,Cute !! Super cute t-shirt keep in mind to is fairly long
0,"Shrunk to toddler size I washed and dried this in my dryer after one wear and it shrunk to the size of a toddler shirt. i dried it on medium. i can not really wear it unless i want to show off my belly. i loved the color (lilac). fit, and style when i received it and immediately put it on. so sad about the shrinkage. for a $58 shirt i expected a bit more. retailer should suggest air drying the shirt. so bummed and disappointed!!!! i would not recommend this shirt unless you can remember to air dry it every time."
1,Very cute! I ordered this top despite the other reviews and i'm very glad i did. it is adorable. well made and very flattering. i am usually a size xs or 00 but based on the reviews sized up to a 0. fits perfectly. not snug at all. highly recommend!
1,"Dreamy pajama pants These pajama pants are dreamy in all ways! incredibly soft, with a soft and not binding elastic waist. plus, the print is evocative.

i am 5'8"" and a size 2/4. i bought these in the store. the only size left was one pair of xs. sure enough they fit.

the length is perfect. 

i just ordered a pair for my sister."
1,Great casual skirt Skirt has lots of stretch and comes up to waistline so i am not sure yet how i will wear it but tucked in or out it looks very stylish and the dark denim is of course slimming.
1,"Nice light weight pajamas I just purchased these pajamas on-line and they are very pretty in person. i found them to be tts in my usual size small though a bit on the long side as i'm only 5'4"". i don't mind a little extra length though because these are just to lounge/sleep in. i think these soft pj's will be great during the warmer months as they are very light weight and comfortable. you'll absolutely love the print on them and wish there was a matching top!"
1,"Great top Love this, it's a great update your basic tee!"
1,"Great everyday dress I love this dress! it is amazingly comfortable and flattering (i would think to many body types). i have a more athletic, petite body build and this dress gives me great curves. i have already received so many compliments while wearing it out! the best part is, i can wear it to work (i'm a teacher), and then wear it out by easily dressing it up."
1,"Cute t shirt Love this t-shirt, its comfortable and very cute. it runs a little large i am 5'0 110 pounds and got a xs. 
the color is a little brighter than the picture."
0,Terrible! The back of the shirt has a tag stitched in with red thread that goes through to the outside of the shirt. it is very visible and looks terrible - especially since the back is the focal point of the shirt. do not recommend
0,Poor fit The shirt is very soft but it felt very large and unflattering. the back felt bulky and looked awkward. definitely returning.
1,"Versatile I originally took a liking on the pink one, but my complexion indicated i'm better off with the gray one. this piece is so versatile that i am still able to wear it during my pregnancy (and post too!). this is a good investment."
1,"Casual, curve hugging, but crooked seam I wanted to love this dress... and i did until i turned around. the back seam didn't hang right. it pulled towards the knotted side, across my behind. i tried on two different xs that they has in store and both had the same issue. one of the dresses hung much looser, i had to recheck the tag because i didn't believe it was the same size! disappointing because it really is pretty and showcases curves nicely."
1," I got a small (5'9, 135lbs) and it fits great! it is super comfortable and also looks really good on."
0,"Felt too maternity I was bummed about this top. detail on back is pretty, even so, not worth it. i'm usually an xs i'm  120 lbs and it fit true to size. guess i had higher expectations. i'm feel consistently let down with what the pictures convey and the actual item when it arrives in person..."
1,"Cute! This tunic is just adorable. material is very soft and slightly stretchy and drapes so nicely with just the right amount of fullness without spilling into maternity territory. i got it in the pink color which is really a very beautiful rose color, perfect for spring. the tie back detail is so cute and adds a feminine touch.
fit is tts. i'm 5' 103 lbs 32b and i got it in an xxs regular which fits me perfectly. i was afraid it would be too long on me since there was no option for petite sizes in"
1,"Great material Love the lilac purple color, breathable yet not see through material is soft on your skin. i like the small detail cut out in the back, and a high bonus point for not showing your bra. one minor thing i would change is the length of the string in the back, but not a big deal."
1,"Wowser Made by dawn suits are the bomb. the bottom is a tiny bit cheeky, but not thong territory- just enough side leg to be seriously sexy. the quality is fantastic, soft with nude lining. love the retro feel to the high neck top- enough support even for my 36d's. so comfy, i forgot i was wearing it at lunch. the normal triangle tops cut into my shoulders/neck, and this style does not. amazing quality and well worth the price.
fyi- large top fit perfectly, but i needed a medium bottom."
1,"Great for a saturday afternoon I purchased this product online so wasn't able to try it on before purchase. it fits perfect. i am 5'7 and 160 lbs. the only thing i did not like was the fabric, it is very thin. you can see undergarment lines in the back."
0,"Not worth the money! I brought this shirt for a vacation, it fitted well and was flattering. totally a comfortable wear, however, after 1 wash on delicate & hang dry small holes appeared near the bottom. i am hoping i can return it. not worth the money."
1," Very cute, but i would not call it pink. it's more of a melon color."
1,"Love, love!!! I just need to write a review on this sweater because it's the best!!! i currently own the cream/blue stripe sweater and have recieved many compliments. what i was most happy about it was the fact that i have washed it several times and the sweater looks like new and has held it's shape. i have ordered the gold one as well and it's still on backorder, waiting for it to arrive :) don't procrastinate, it's worth the price."
0,"Too boxy I ordered a regular size s and it was way too boxy for my body type and shorter than the stated length. i don't know if the length stated is from a size m, but the small was definitely shorter (in the front at least).  if you're petite with curves like me, it's not a flattering cut."
1,"Lightweight and well made The material on these is super lightweight but still strong, perfect for summer. so hard to find great lounge-sleep clothing in summer for a house without ac. 

illustrations are beautiful in person. i wish they still had more in stock, i want to buy for my mom!

also, i am tall and i like that they are long."
0,"Tie back tunic I usually love tops like this, i bought this is the store because if was so soft. got it home and was so disappointed because it is not very flattering at all.would be a great house top though because it is soft enough to sleep in."
1,"Complimentary color After seeing this top in the catalog i also spotted it in the retailer store. the peach color is even more perfect in person and compliments my skin tone perfectly. the style of the top is unique and flattering. now that i see even more colors, i'll need to buy more. my one reservation is that the material is super soft but very thin, so i hope it doesn't get holes - i want to wear this one all summer!"
1,"Great boyfriend sweater! Love this sweater! warm, cozy and and not ordinary!!! fits great too! no surprises!"
1, This is a great everyday top that is very versatile.
0,"Not impressed I'm 5'4"" 120# , 34d. this dress did nothing for me. the seem on the side with the knot doesn't look right. it's almost on the side but not really. there's a seem down the center of the butt from the waist. it looks weird from the back because it's such a fine striped print. not flattering at all. the dress is comfortable due to the stretchy knit and it has a stretchy knit lining. hit me just a bit lower than on the model."
1," Yes, this top is not of the best quality but i bought it on sale with an additional 25% off. it has a very cute design on the back and will be cute on while running errands on a hot day. it's true to size: i'm 5'6"", 150 lbs and m fit well."
1,"Great piece Ok so this top is as cute in person as it is online. runs very small as theres no stretch or give in fabric. i normally wear 12 and i couldnt even halfway get this on lol. i may consider a 14-16 but the stores didnt have this yet to try on. the ladies at the counter were crushing on this top though!
if you can find your fit this top is great for layering!"
1,"Pretty blue That was the only color i liked. it's great if you have a tummy like me and is long enough in the back to cover your butt. back detail is cute, but annoying. sometimes it shifts around and my bra shows, and the string is at least 3 feet too long. 
not bad, i wear it with white gauze pants, looks nice. good with leggings too."
1, This dress is made very well and can be dressed up or down! it can be worn with open toe wedges in spring and summer and cute booties in the fall.
1,"Lovely The dress is lovely. my only knock on it is i didn't really feel like the top and the skirt matched in terms of level of dress. i guess the top just wasn't ""fancy"" enough for me. but it is a very beautiful skirt. i wish it was in a tea length. the fit was spot on."
1,"Fit off I got a medium as i usually wear that in everything. i am a 36d and this pulled a bit across my chest and back. it is a cute idea, but the fit is off for my body. i am 5'6 and hits me shorter than shown on the model, so hits at an odd length. i may try to order a large and see if it is better on me, because i am so hopeful for this to look cute on me! the teal blue color is beautiful, the pink is more a blush and washed me out, the grey is just grey. i bought three thinking this would be my go t"
1,"***please restock size 32 in other washes*** The perfect fit and style of any jean ever. i order one size up in petites. i love these jeans and want them in every color/wash. they have wonderful stretch that does not sag. i wear them with cuffs folded up in hot weather but can also wear them down thanks to petite styling. love, love."
1,Falling for fringe Simply lovely to look at because of the fringe detail and it's a joy to wear because it does not cling to my trouble spots.  very versatile as it can be worn and layered in many different ways.  i was lucky enough to buy this in petite but i'm sure the regular would've been fine.  looking forward to outfitting this because i got so much inspiration from instagram.
1,Wanderlust sleep pants Cozy and beautiful - everything dreamy sleep pants should be. great for gifting. make bedtime feel a little more pampered.
1,"Unique, beautiful, and romantic This tunic is overall very pretty with soft material and very comfy- not itching. the color is more like a taupe than what's shown on picture. i love it very much as the design is unique, romantic but also classic. it goes well with skinny jeans or black leggings."
1,"Love! Bought this cardigan on a whim as a birthday treat pre myself! love it! i get a compliment everyone i wear it! the quality is great, fits great (with a roomy feel)."
0,"Disappointing I was so disappointed when i received this top. the color is some washed-out faded version of the picture shown and the cut is much fuller than it looks in the picture. the back is cute but not worth the awful, drab actual color."
1,"No closure The sweater is very very warm. it looks okay, not the best but not bad. i had high expectations so was disappointed to see no closure, i don't wear sweaters and jackets without closures. i like having the option of closing buttons if it gets any colder. so i am sending it back."
1,"Soft and thick without the bulk I got so many compliments on this the first day i wore it. i think of this more like a sweater coat than a regular sweater. it is extremely soft and warm, but not bulky at all. it lays really neatly, which is why i think of it more like a coat. this will definitely be a staple moving into the winter and then into spring. keep in mind though that this does not button - they're just for show."
1,"Much better in person. This is a beautiful sweater. the photo doesn't do it justice. the model is wearing too large a size. i wear a l in moth and definitely looked better in the medium. the price is too high but the 25% savings thanksgiving weekend helps to blunt the pain. the lining is soft but was wrinkled on all the sweaters. the coloring is very flattering and, with care, this should be able to be worn for years. it can be used as a dressy coat sweater or fabulous over casual clothes. i wasn' particularly impress"
1,"Pretty Bra s great, but it has a lot of push-up padding. this might be nice for smaller cup sizes, but for a 34dd, it was a little overkill/unnecessary."
1," Just received these this morning and so happy. cartonnier always makes a substantial quality product. might run a little large,depends how roomy you want them, lovely colors and perfect length. wish they came in other colors."
1,Love it It does run large. i got it on sale and it is a great sweater / coat for $200.00. i would not have paid the full price of 450.00 but i do love it. every time i wear it someone complements me.
1,"Big bold and beautiful but not for me Lovely print and colors. interior lining was so super soft, but it did lay right on me, felt very big and bulkly and i wasn't a fan of the single snap closure, esp being so low, so i decided it was not for me at that price and returned. 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c and the s was too big. it is beautiful and i will consider the xs if the price is cut further."
1,"I call this green carpet But i do love it, i jsut can't pull it off as i am simply too ""petite"" (short, i look lost in it, and sold out in petites). my taller friend, however, tried it on and we both loved it. the colors are really fun, and it is warm."
1,"Very flattering! Love this jumpsuit, i was rather apprehensive as i didn't think it would look as good on me as on the model but i am totally smitten with it. very flattering, especially if you have some bumps and rolls. i ordered in a medium (5.7 and 145 lbs and it fits perfectly. definitely recommend to order down. 
as i'm wearing it to yoga i wear a sports bra underneath, that also helps with the very deep and open back to cover up a bit more. highly recommend, the top hits in all the right spots to make one"
1,"Enveloping cacoon of warmth I first saw this sweater coat in the retailer catalog that i got in the mail. i thought it was beautiful. so ethereal! i never thought that i would own it, though because of the initial price. i never thought it would make it to clearance. to my surprise, it did, and then went the extra 30% off! i took the plunge. i followed the advice of the other reviewers, and ordered a size down, a small. i am glad that i did. i still feel like i get the oversized, wrapped in warmth feel. it is not a figure fl"
1,"On the fence The blue color is beautiful and what attracted me to this sweater. the draped front is very flattering and the fit is true to size. unfortunately the banded hem creates a pouching effect that is very unflattering. i really wanted to love this sweater, but just can't figure out how to wear it without poofing. i think this is the reason it is tucked in in many of the model shots. it is still a pretty sweater and it may work with for some."
1,"Cute dress I just received this today by mail, i am going to keep it as the reddish color is really pretty, it is very lightweight and will travel well for my summer vacations. however my first observation is the same as was noted in a previous review - not quite sure how to keep this dress in place - as soon as you move your arms around the dress goes out of place - and it slips back onto your shoulders . hopefully it will work out, will try a couple more times before i make a final decision i think."
1,"Very pretty, but... I agree with a prior reviewer who stated this seems overpriced - it is. it's very lightweight and not quite the quality i would expect for the price (the washing instructions tag was sewn in all crooked - really?). i ordered the black as i was hoping to wear this to a dressy (though not formal) event but i am not sure it works on me. i think it would be a really fun summer dress option in either of the 2 colors (the blue looks really pretty online).

it is very cute but definitely runs large."
1, Like the crossover design of this sweater. the v-neck is not low cut and can be worn without cami. sweater is thin but not find it to be see through although i always were tank tops under my shirts. did not find it to be itchy.
1,"Love! I saw this sweater coat in store and thought it was gorgeous! i was turned off by the price so i waited for it to go on sale. luckily, i snatched it up right away. as other reviewers have stated, it is meant to be worn as a coat/jaclket and for me the medium ( i am usually a size 8 or medium in retailer) fit was slighly oversized on my 5'9 145lb frame. i admit that this not an item that i would usually have in my wardrobe and was not sure how the sweater and the fit looked on me. i was afraid it w"
1,"My new fave! This is my new favorite summer dress, seriously. i purchased this dress while there were no reviews at the time but i'm so glad a took a chance. the colors are pretty close to the picture shown; maybe more of a lilac hue than mauve. i normally wear a 6 petite or a 4 regular in dresses, so i went with a 6p. as other reviewers have mentioned, this dress seems to run a little bigger so i could have easily gotten a 4 petite (for the shorter length) and it still would've been flowy. i have chosen to"
1, Dress really pretty and great quality. slip is small if large breasted.
0,"Shrunk! I loved the fit and vibrant color of this dress. it's loose and flows but doesn't look like a potato sack. i wore it once and got a ton of compliments. that said, i hand washed it, as the tag states, then let it line dry, and it shrunk to half its size! i re-checked the tag and noticed that under the hand wash instructions it then states ""dry clean recommended."" boo. so disappointed that i spend over $100 for a dress i wore once."
1,"Very chic I found this at my retailer store--the only dress left. i bought this in black in my usual size small (4-6). this dress was so pretty on and fabulous in hot weather. the material is gauzy and so the look is casual. i'm not sure i would wear it in the evening but the fit was great. i am tall, (5' 9"") and the dress is long enough for me. i would say it is the same length as on the model. it is a bit pricey for what it is but i bought it as a birthday gift to myself."
1," Ok. so this coat is amazing! it's high quality, soft, great pattern. the knit lining helps to make this more of a light weight coat than a sweater type coat. it's been warmer this season so i've worn it as a coat and received many compliments. it might not be warm enough for january in new england but i bought a size up so i could wear it over a sweater and still use it as a coat. this was purchased on sale w 25% off sale code, so for me, that was a steal. so happy it went on sale! give it a try"
0,"Black is see-through up close I'm usually a small (5'5"", 116 lbs, long torso), but the x-small fit well. the black does look see-through in the pictures, but i figured i could wear a cami with it. it is see-through in person if you are up close, mainly in the back and arms since the front has extra fabric in places. however, it is rather short, possibly because it is an x-small, and i'll need a short cami to fit under it or will have to have a cami hanging out of the bottom, which drapes nicely and a cami may mar that effect"
1,Retailer classic This sweater coat is a keeper. yes it runs large but if you wear it as a coat and not a sweater it works well. plus it is very warm. for size i normally wear a large 12/14 and i ordered a medium. great for layering soft winter whites. i wore this christmas shopping and everyone asked about it all day. this will for sure go into my retailer classic closet.
1,"Lovely unique Loved this sweater coat the first time i saw it online......then the price....yikes! the style, color and fabric design is beautiful. waited for it to sale and then hurray an extra 30%. off to my local store for a try on as i would not have wanted to even try it at the regular price. it is wonderful! it runs very large. i went down two sizes to achieve the fit i was looking for from a large to a small. in my opinion the product shot model is wearing a size too large. even sizing down it is not t"
1,"Get a slip! Beautiful dress...appropriate for sunday, and special occasions. grab a 'honey slip' to compensate for the sheerness, and you're set! one star off for static cling. otherwise, no regrets with this purchase."
1,"Beautiful blue color, great design, snags easily This pullover is a beautiful deep blue color with a unique, relaxed design. when i first bought it, i found a snag on it and had to exchange it. the new pullover didn't have any snags, but did have a hole along the seam. i really like the pullover's relaxed fit and unique design, but the fabric doesn't seem very durable and is prone to snagging. time will tell how well the fabric holds up."
1, Runs a tad big but not enough to say it runs large if that makes sense - but just beautiful!
0,"Awkward sweater I wanted this sweater to work but sadly it failed. first, the pink was way to sheer for my liking. the sheerness caused a weird color overlap on the stomach area. then the band at the bottom was too tight causing a weird ballooning affect. a shirt underneath could work but it takes away from the beauty of the knit. the soft pink is gorgeous but not good for medium to light skinned folks."
1,"Beautiful dress! My mother, who is not a dress person, ordered this dress for a summer wedding in the black hills. we'd spend 20+ hours searching for the perfect dress, and she'd returned three other options (different stores). after admiring this dress for awhile, she decided to try it, and is so happy she did! the color is just a slightly darker shade of purple than what is pictured in most of the images, but that's what she was hoping for. it fits wonderfully, and looks extremely elegant."
1,"Perfect Great jeans, great cut, great fit & i love the distressed look. the rise was higher than i thought but not a deal-breaker. i typically wear 26 in most brand of jeans & got these in 26."
1,"One for the girls with some curves! Clothes generally tend to look great when you're svelte. hence thin models. i've recently put on a few pounds (normally a 4-6, xs, small in retailer, 5'6"" and i have boobs) and when i get lazy and eat a little too much i get it around the middle. i already have a chest so that makes finding clothes to look flattering harder bc the boobs create the apple effect. all that said just to make the point that this is a flattering sweater. i grabbed it last minute on the way to the dressing room, but i ne"
1,"Cocoony fit I agree with the other reviewer-- this is classic retailer old-style quality. the lining inside is soft to the touch and the colors are vividly magical. the only reason i am not pining for it is the odd balloon-fit of the waist. i usually choose s/m in cardigans (for ref, 5'8"", 135 lbs, 34-b), but even the small of this sweater-coat dwarfed me. i think it just depends what you are looking for. unique it is, and certainly lovely."
1,"Vibrant colors, beautiful This coat is really beautiful, and pictures don't do it justice. it runs very large. i'm normally an xl or l in sweaters, but because of the balloony shape, i actually took a medium - even then it looks like i'm being enveloped, so i prefer to wear it unsnapped."
1, Yes! this dress is so lovely. i wear a size 6. a size 6 in this was perfect. under slip over a delicate overlay. heading to italy and this will be so perfect. drape is so flattering. colors are feminine. cut is lovely. effortlessly elegant and reads much more expensive. don't hesitate. a special one.
1,"Retailer catog cover coat So many retailer coats have gotten away from me. sold out before i could purchase. i bought this during the holidays when it went on sale. i did not want this the be the one that got away. so glad i did. the colors are beautiful, the sweater is really a coat. so it justifies the price. what a gorgeous piece to wear with all of my retailer clothes. length of arms was fine on me. i bought a large. i am 5 foot six."
1,"Not for me... I'm surprised to be unhappy with this... reading all the rave reviews. but, i had a different experience with it. the cut is funky... and seemed much more tapered on me than on the model in the picture. i think if you're very slim, this may work well, but for any curves or hips... not so flattering... imo. i think it's a pretty jacket... but not for me... it's going back. and ps... i paid $448 for it and see it's on sale for about 1/2 that just a week later. the discounted price may be a good de"
1,"Knock out! I'll admit, i had a lot of sticker shock when i saw this was a moth sweater coat at this price point. but i was immediately drawn to it. this is a one of a kind piece for sure. the colors are vibrant, the design is stylish and it is beautifully unstructured. it has a cocoon shape, wool on the outside and a soft knit on the inside. its a bit heavier (as you would expect a wool coat to be.) my absolute favorite part is the print. very classic on top, and very boho on bottom. it is gorgeous. i woul"
1,"Omg yes! Alright ladies...this jacket!! its even better than it appears online. the green anorak fabric has a little stretch to it and is super comfortable. because of the stretch, i was able to do a large instead of my normal xl. but the real show stopper is the fringed sweater. it is gorgeous. it lays beautifully open or closed and is so soft and warm. the design has so much detail to it. there is also this amazing tie in back so you can cinch the waist if you want. this jacket will look amazing with a"
0,"See through When i received this dress in the mail, i was thrilled. i loved the color and the style, although a bit too much material but comfortable. when i went to show my husband the dress, his first comment was very sexy. i can see your underwear and your skin!!! i don't understand why no one mentioned this in any of the comments on this dress. when i went into the light i saw that the dress was see through and i sadly had to return it."
1,"Warm, love and classic wardrobe piece This jacket is beautiful in colors and warm enough to wear in the fall or layer it with a sweater in the winter. it is more taylored at the bottom at the legs and would be great with leggings or jeans. i originally ordered a large but found myself swimming in it so happy it was still available in medium so i re-ordered it. definitely order it in a size smaller. sadly it was after the sale had ended but great customer service they issued it for me at the price i originally paid. (ps i'm 8 months"
1," This is such a lovely piece. i usually wear a medium in moth. i am 135 pounds and 5'4"". the quality is exceptional. i highly recommend this sweater coat."
1,"Whispering wisteria Light and delicate and certainly not a color i would usually pick for myself but at sale price this was a lucky steal for me! if i had known how much i would love this dress i would've paid full price. as for sizing, i am top heavy but picked the smaller end of my size range instead of my usual. the slip is just about tts and the silk outer is larger and flowy. for fit reference: 5'3"", 36dd, 140#, barrel chested, large upper arms and i purchased size 8."
1,"Perfect dress This dress is so beautiful. i am 50 5'8"" and smaller on top larger on bottom. size 6 is perfect! was worried that it would hit me in all the wrong places. happy to say it does not. wore it for the first time yesterday and no lie i received no less than 15 compliments from strangers. just walked up to tell me how great the dress was. colors are so soft and beautiful. would buy in other colors if they had it. i can see myself wearing it to a casual dinner, to a wedding our just to feel special on"
1,"Soft, feminine and perfect for summer Like my title suggests this is lovely and perfect for summer. the lining however is not silk it's rayon and sat weird on me. it offered no coverage on my top and actually is quite useless (i do have a large bust). i have a free people slip that will work and because of that will i'm keeping the dress. the outer shell is silk and really lovely and the colours are true to the picture."
1," I ordered this coat online without trying it on in person. the pictures on the models are stunning. i have a long, mostly rectangular physique with long legs and a little extra love around the middle. i like wearing long sweaters and drapey things that accentuate the positive. i thought this was right up my alley. but, it person it has a weird bunchiness around my middle due to the hidden pockets. the sleeves are a bit too long and the lapels and shoulders make me look beefier than i am up top."
1,Simple but pretty Love this sweater! it is very simple but pretty! it has a very flattering fit and is comfortable.
0," The print, colors and fabric of this sweater are lovely. the design is quirky to say the least. i ordered a small, as i usually do. i am 5'2"" and weigh 120lbs. this sweater somewhat gathers or balloons out at the hip area and is so huge that it looked like i was wearing a giant table cloth or stadium blanket. it looked like i had a pillow stuffed in my backside because of how the sweater gathers up at the waist. it's not flattering at all."
1,"Beautiful and flowy I was a little apprehensive about getting this dress without any reviews, but i am really glad i did. first, it looks exactly as pictured, maybe even more beautiful. the material is nice and flowing, and very light, so it's going to make a fantastic summer dress. there are two layers- an under layer which can be completely detached from the pink silk top layer.  the reason why i say true to size is that even though the pink silk layer is pretty loose, the bottom layer conforms more your body. i'"
1,"Pretty but very thin This sweater is very pretty but the material is extremely thin. the blue was ok but the white is nearly see-through. the design is unique but unless it fits really well, the bottom hem where it criss-crosses can bunch out in a weird way. i got my usual s and it was rather loose, causing this to happen. i suggest you size down if you want it to look smooth like it does on the model."
0,"Cute dress, narrow fit of the slip I really like the color and flow of this dress. the dress itself fit well however the slip was extremely tight through the bust. i have a large bust at 34d however most dresses are still wearable especially flowy dresses. unfortunately i had to return this one because of the slip."
1,"Love This dress is a beautiful classic ! i am 5""3 113 size 0 fits perfectly !"
0,Shorter than expected I ordered this in hopes of wearing as a tunic with leggings for my rehearsal dinner. it is much shorter than expected and wouldn't have looked right with leggings. it also was more gray than ivory and in the short time i had it on was shedding lint like crazy. beautiful in photos but didn't work for me.
0," Very cute shorts. sadly, after one wash they became a lint magnet so had to be returned. disappointing quality."
1,"Favorite royal blue feminine top I treated myself to get this at full-price at the start of summer. my size is xl and it fits me like the model photos. i have gotten such good use out of this blouse. it washes well without shrinking. it's vintage-looking. so comfortable. i love the arm coverage, interesting neckline that covers bra straps, good length. the cami it came with is flimsy so i threw it away. i use another tank underneath. i'd love any of the colors. the blus was more my color but all of them are gorgeous because of"
1,"Better in person... I expected this to be a pretty basic peasant top but was pleasantly surprised with all aspects of my purchase. fabric is soft and flowing with a perfect feminine vibe. it has a nice liner and the length and fit are perfect. can be dressed up or down as you like it. does run a bit large but it's due to the style, not the sizing. i ordered my usual size and cannot be happier with it. go ahead-press the button!"
0,"Too much material I was very excited to get this dress in the mail. i wasn't sure about the sizing because there weren't any reviews written yet. i got the m which fit across my chest area and fit fine, but there was just so much fabric below the bust. i love that it's different, but i think you'd have to be a stick figure for this shape to work for you. it does not flatter your body at all."
1,"Nice fabric I really like this shirt. it runs somewhat big but i love the oversized effect as seen on the model. i normally wear a m in shirts and the s was spot on. the only quality issue is with the buttons..they are a bit flimsy when you unbutton them. other than that, this is a great shirt and the price with the promo is just right."
1,"Lovely top Purchased in white. very pretty top. i thought it would be more lace - but non the less, it is lovely."
0," Buttons were broken off when i opened the package, stretchy at waist, not good quality for the price."
1,"Love this dress This dress is beautiful. i love the collar and tie neck detail. i decided to order up a size and am very glad i did (i normally wear a 0 or 2 petite and ordered this in a 4 petite). it fits perfect with a little room...not snug at all, which i like. the description says its a slimmer fit so i'm happy i ordered the size i did. i'm excited to wear it and add it to my wardrobe."
1,"Adorable-timeless Beautiful, timeless dress. runs small, straight fit. can't wait to wear it to work or a function,"
0,Fabric not comfortable A pretty blouse but the polyester fabric makes it incredibly warm and uncomfortable on after a while. had to return it.
1,Feminine and fresh Well made gorgeous skirt that can be worn with heels and lace top or tee shirt and big jewelry. true to size. i am a 2/4 and the extra small was great. poofs out a bit but not like you're a fairy. i would say the blue (which i ordered) is more of a seafoam / mint green which is also lovely and spring time.
1,"Perfect pocket tee Omg! where have you been all my life? this t-shirt is the best....not see-through, perfect length, perfect v-neck (no cami required), amazing colors, perfect shape, not tight (body skimming), doesn't poof out or look weird on larger busts and goes with everything from jeans to dress pants. i want every color, but for now i ordered the moss and blue which goes perfectly with my fair skin and long silver hair. oh and did i mention the sleeves are perfect to wear with or without a cardigan! no slee"
1,Beautiful and comfortable These are the perfect combination of comfort and beauty. i highly recommend.
1,Flattering and comfortable. I love wide-leg pants and i'm so glad they're back. i bought this pair in the navy and cream colors as soon as i saw them online. i bought my usual size 28 in retailer and they fit just fine. the navy color is more like a dark blue but still perfect for spring/summer. comfortable material and overall good quality. i just wish they came in more colors.
1," I love this dress. so cute and easy to wear. with sandals, flip flops or tennis shoes. the material is a bit thicker than what i prefer for warmer weather, but very comfortable. this is my new favorite weekend/errand/summer out and about dress. can't wait to take it on vacation!"
1,"Not for me These pants are so comfortable and i love the color, but they did not work for me."
1,"Basic but not boring Great basic tee with just the right amount of extra detail. the length is perfect--not too long, not too short. fit is relaxed and comfortable without looking sloppy. i'm coming back for more colors!"
1,"Ok shirt, white is off white As with many of retailer's tops these days, there is a lot of fabric on this tee. it hangs fairly well, though. the white color is cream, which didn't work for me but isn't bad. a little sheer but wearable with a nude bra. if you have a thinnish upper body, order down a size!"
1,"Funky but not over the top I generally like this style of pants- and these are particularly interesting, flattering and perfect for the season. love them.

the style can be bohemian and chic or more conservative. the color is also a dark navy, and there is black leather piping on the 'pockets' making them a neutral- navy or black. i've worn with a long sleeveless hi-low hemmed button down top and neutral (saddle) heels for work with a cream jacket- and with a t'shirt and flats for the weekend.

1,"Omg the best dress This is the best dress. i received it last week and have already worn it three times. perfect fit. casual and so easy but the length and front details make it so fun. thicker than many other ""tshirt"" dresses... but light enough that i wasn't overly hot on super warm days. def recommend!!!!"
1,"Comfy and cute I tried this on in the store and was pleasantly surprised at how cute it was! i'm 5'4"" and the large fits me loosely but is still shapely. because it's a little longer on me, it's great to wear both to work and on the weekends. just wish it came in more colors! you can't see the color in the photo, but there's a sea green lining which is a cute touch!"
1,"One of my most favorite purchases ever This is one of the best purchases i've ever made... i have had the black for over a year, and every time i wear it, i receive so many complements. i've dressed it up with a striped scooped back shirt, or a fitted sweater, and paired it with flannel with a belt... i love it. i'm 6' ft and slender, and the xs it hits me at the perfect length just below the knee. i recently ordered the silver in a small (it's a little big in the waist- but nothing a corset belt can't help) for nye. love this dress!"
1,"Love the fit - so comfy The picture onlin does not do these pant jsutice, it makes them look wide and short. well, that might be why these are percect for me, but on my body type (muscular bottom), they are awesome. the material is stretchy, soft, and thick enough to keep shape and not show dimples. lvoe the blue and green color, so rich. i am keeping the green as they are more unique. at 115 lbs, i ordered 25p. the yfit perfectly, but my styllsit keeps insiting that they wil lstretch and made me order the 24p. we shal"

1,"Comfortable, flattering, and funky These pants are super funky. the colors have a 70's vibe. retailer do the pants a disservice styling them like the image on the website. they are playfully chic. besides the look, they are super comfy and have a nice stretch. perfect for my job as an art teacher. give them a shot!"
1,"Beautiful?? I love the way these pants feel on. they are so comfortable and breezy. i love that i can feel cool in the summer without showing a lot of skin. i purchased both colors; both are very nice looking. that said, i'm not sure if i will keep them. they wrinkle something terrible. i'm pretty casual person and it even bothers me. it probably wouldn't be so bad if there weren't pleats in the front. after sitting for just a few minutes the pants look like a disaster in front. my husband said it's not ext"
1,"Comfortable I love these pants! typically, i have a difficult time finding pants that fit my smaller waist and curvier hips and legs, but these fit well enough. all i need to do it have the waist tailored and they will be perfect. the pants are also soft. the only downside, and it is not a deal breaker for me, is that they run a little large and seem to stretch out a bit with wear. considering this, i would downsize one size."
1,"A win! This shirt is everything i wanted it to be! lightweight, easy style without being shapeless. it is sheer, but perfect with a tank underneath. i'm an extra small, and it fit perfectly - not tight, not too loose...honestly, if it came in more colors i'd buy it in every one. definitely going to be a fall staple!"
1,"Mixed review Loved it on the hanger and when i tried it on. it's a gorgeous shade of blue (denim, not navy) with some light tie-dye streaking along the top and sides which add interest. the ""bat wing"" feature is a little limiting; i won't be able to reach anything high without the whole top coming up with me. as for the material, it's an interesting blend bc it isn't soft or rough. some may say it's itchy and some may say it's soft, to me it isn't either. it's merely smooth enough. which sounds terrible, ""it"
1,"Finally! I am so glad that wide leg pants are coming back! i love this style - so flattering! the color on these (blue) is rich and unique and the fit is exactly what i was hoping for. i wanted them loose and low waisted and they are perfect. i am 5'4"" 122 lbs and ordered 27 petite. the length (listed at 30"") is spot-on with flats, no tailoring needed. i previously ordered these in white in 27 r. they also are good but a little too loose and will need hemming. def. recommend and hope retailer keeps this st"
1,"Fancy or casual Love this dress. i'm wearing it as a bridesmaid in a fall, casual outdoor wedding. i think it's fancy enough and can also be dressed down later. 

i'm 6' tall and skinny, with large breasts and this dress fits. beautiful! not too much cleavage. :)

it's not real lace but no one could tell. great quality and nice weight to dress. great for dancing and spinning!"
1, Great casual weekend pants and super comfy and great color.
1,"Unique These culottes are fun. i bought the neutral color with the black stripes in xs. in my opinion, they run big. i am usually a small (4-6), 31"" waist, 38"" hips. pleats at the hip and low waist area are not always my friend, but with a longer tank or shirt, they looked fine. the fabric moves in a graceful way and these culottes can be dressed up or down. so far, wrinkling isn't a huge problem but we'll see. i am 5' 9"" tall and these fall about the same place on the model--mid calf. they looked grea"
1,"So glad i got these! I knew i would love these pants because of the cute sailor styling, but the unusual green color. i am 5'5"" and thought i would be stepping on them, but i am fine. they are longer than the picture with the model on the website which i expected, but they are fine. the fabric is beautiful and i can't wait to wear them with my white-on-white sneakers. i will also mix it up with sandals. i wrote below that my style is bohemian, but truthfully i dress in all the ways listed below...classic, romantic,"
1," I love these pants! i got the blue ones. i got a petite 25 and i am 115lbs 5.1.5' - they sit low on waste and hug curves just right. they are little bit long, maybe 1 inch too long. will wear with platform or thick squared heel."
1,"Awesome lounge pants These pants are so comfortable. they're very flowy, and provide so much airflow to keep you cool during hot days. i actually bought these pants for work (i'm a teacher). i like to pair them with a white top and a cardigan. the waist band is elastic, which is super nice. the only thing i would like better is if the waist line was higher. the pants come up right below my natural waist, so they're not quite as high waisted as i would like. but other than that, their silky material give them the ill"
1," These pants are great! they are comfortable, light and flowy. they are perfect for summer!"
1,"Fabulous This tee is very comfortable and the colors are amazing! i initially purchased in the marigold yellow as i was instantly drawn to the color in store. it's a beautiful shade that will transition nicely into fall. i've since purchased the green which i liked on even more so than on the rack. overall, a nice quality everyday tee. the pocket and embroidered neck make it something retailer!!"
1,"Cute but not sure about fit Very cute. love the animals on it, especially the bunnies! however not sure about fit. fits perfectly at waist but fabric expands a bit further down; it seems to billow/puff/bag in lower part, not at bottom but in the stomach area, like there is too much fabric. so it fits, but also looks like there's something slightly off. interested in hearing other's opinions about this. also i am slightly und 5 ft. there'no petite option but the standard stops slightly above my knees so length seems ok."
1,"Nice staple to have for leggings I have a sillier style sweater from moth that i got last year and love. this is not as great, but i like the style so i will keep it. i knew the sleeves would be shorter, but wish they were made full length with a little less ""bat wing"". the color is close to as shown- maybe a little lighter. i was hoping for more of a navy since that is what they are calling it- but this is more of a denim blue."
1,Beautiful color I love these pants. they are a beautiful color and very well made. i like the fit and the style very much.
1,"Colorful fun slim pant If i hadn't seen the description online, i would never have known these pants were navy! 
i bought them today and tried them on with a black tunic which looked fantastic. the style is very similar to cartonnier slim pant but the fabric is lighter weight and stretchier.
since i'm heavy around the stomach, i will wear the pant with a long tunic top (to avoid the drumstick look) which is a shame since the pockets are so cute. the colors in the pants mean that you can match and contrast with a wid"
1,"Fabulous skirt!!! I love this skirt... i have it in black, and when i saw this color i was so excited to add another one to my wardrobe. these skirts are made  well... it's not flimsy at a all. the actually color is more of a light aqua blue, so if you are wanting a baby blue might not be for you..."
1,"Great dress for taller ones Overall: a super comfy dress that you can wear anywhere. short, petite ladies beware though; the dress does not hang at your natural waist like it shows in the model's photos. in order for me to have it sit at my waist, the dress was folded over and did not flatter."
1,"Very comfortable staple tee I just bought this tee in red. i have worn it and washed it once. i noticed that there is a hole already by the top of the pocket. considering the price, i would hope that it lasts for more than one season."
1,Cute and fun Sweet leg warmers that are fun and cute too! kept me warm when out in this frosty morning!
1,"Fun prints, fun pants Great pants! great fall colors. great for day or night. super fun and funky. love them!"
1,"I like it! Fit was very tts.  it looks more lightweight in the photo than it is in person, it's a fairly medium weight sweater.  i'm 5'8 and curvy, and it is nowhere near as long on me in the front as it is on the model.  i still liked the look, mostly because of the look from the back of the shirt."
1,"Beautiful but decided to return This looks exactly as shown in the photo. you can tell that it's a really thin, lightweight knit that's almost transparent.  i ordered a large and it fits the way it does on the model. am returning because i have a large 34 g bust and this top really emphasized my chest. it also grabs a bit under the arms. the color looks just like it does in the photos. it hangs nicely and isn't oversized, which i liked. the texture and ribbing on the sleeves, hem and pocket take this a step up from the ordinar"
1," It's not them it's me. so sad. ordered two sizes 25 r and 24 p. nothing about them worked for me. i loved the colors (blue and green). i loved"" the fabric (heavy washed soft cotton). i loved the style. ah but there is the rub. i am so small that the width of the legs just swallowed me up. whereas the 24s fit around the waist and the length, while longer than i'd have liked was doable, there was just so much fabric around my skinny legs i felt as though i was wearing huge balloons on each leg. (t"
1,"Flattering and simply perfect I tried these on in the store and instantly fell in love with them - they have an elastic waist which for my shape (pear) can sometimes be bad, but these pants don't cut me off or accentuate the ""fluffy"" parts, but lay nice over my belly and legs in a flattering way. they do have a slit that goes the whole way up the leg, that the picture doesn't show, but the underneath piece of fabric wraps around your legs, so i think it would be hard to show too much. i bought a medium and they hit lower on"
1,"Beautiful dress, but size up! I am usually a 00 or 0 in dresses, and i ended up with a 4 in this one. i could barley zip up the 0, and while i could have gotten away with the 2, there is no elasticity in the waistband. the 4 is very slightly roomy, but more comfortable than the smaller sizes on me. for reference, i'm 109-111 lbs, 5'4, and a 30b. 

when i was finally able to wear the dress, i got compliments galore. it really is a beautiful dress! just be sure to size up!"
0,Just eh It's just ok. very thin and feel like it might say and stretch. color is very nice but much thinner and sheer we than what i wanted.
1,Great basic dress! This dress is very versatile and flattering on-- i've already worn it out to casual cocktails with friends twice since i've gotten it. i'm 5'3 and 125 lbs and the 4 petite worked perfectly on me.
1,Great summer dress Super comfortable summer dress. just bought it yesterday and i don't want to take it off. soft lightweight fabric.
1,"Versatile I just love all pilcro pants. they are great for any occasion, any type of weather. i am 5'5"" 125 lb. and i wear a 27 in all pilcro pants and they fit perfectly. only bummer is that i have to iron them, but they iron easily. length of these pants is just a tad long, but i can wear wedges with them and that solves the problem."
1,"Love love love This top is super cute and colorful. admittedly, i have not used it just as a pajama top because i think the world deserves to see this piece of art. super comfy and i recommend this for everyone in most shapes and sizes!"
1,"Not flattering. 1. i've been waiting forever for these to finally arrive. i was a bit disappointed.

2. i'm 5'5"" tall, 145 lbs, and 38-32-40. my normal size 30's fit me perfectly, if a bit loose. they fit a lot like the hyphens.

3. the legs are short and wide. they hit me at the ankle, which made them look like high waters on me.

4. the legs are very, very wide, and i didn't think that was flattering on me.

5. same comfy fabric and fit as the hyphens, except the front seemed to dip low at the waist i"
1,Perfect pjs I love these pjs! the sale price finally made the set affordable and i could not be happier! so soft and comfy!
0,"Beautiful color, frumpy fit Great color but frumpy fit. if you have any bust, it looks a bit like maternity"
1,"Cute but fabric has strong odor These are very cute and i bought both colors. they are accurately pictured. however, right out of the bag they had an especially strong chemical-type odor. must be the dye. i have been airing them outside in the sun trying to decide if i will keep them. they seem to be ""calming down"" a bit but it's been two days!! they are not jersey but are a non-stretchy type fabric with a slight sheen. dress up or down. i'm a 00 or 24 and the xs fit well."
1,Summer perfection Purchased the daisy sleep top to go with the matching shorts. i had been eyeing them for awhile in the store and so glad i took the plunge to get the set. i feel feminine and sexy as another reviewer noted while not being revealing (helpful for visitors and children :). i purchased a s as it does run a bit large.
1,"Comfy dress but... I'm being eyeballing this dress for quite a while, finally i decided to jump on it and i was so ansy to receive it in the mail, finally arrived and some how wasn't what i was expecting, the front part has 2 pieces of fabric attached to the sides of the dress that wrap around your waist making that effect you see on the model. to be honest i didn't like that at all, i think they ruined the dress with that, the dress is very comfortable feeling, the fabric is super soft i can imagine wearing this"
1,Cute top Nice non clingy cut. has details so more than a basic t-shirt.
0,"Strange! I purchase this top of ""what i thought to be a beautiful denim tunic/top"" in a small on the sale rack with additional promo with beautiful details , but what is going on with the mid-section where there is at least 6 inches of space where there is no button or way to close the lower placket! and the lower bottom of placket is sewn shut so it makes the mid section bubble out, but why no buttons to close what would be a button down top???? you can slide your hand through this open space and it ope"
1,Perfect wedding skirt! Made my wedding outfit perfect!
1,"Fabulous summer wide legs that flow like a skirt! Love, love, love these pants! i have yet to remove the tags and wear them, but that shall happen over this weekend. the fit is comfortable, and while the pants are not oversized, they are very generous in the m
that i purchased. the colour that seems to confuse more than is few is really a great combination of a black or navy stripe (depends on your lighting and opinion here...!) with tobacco/khaki on a white ground. the pleats at the top

0, Dress just did not fit will around the hips.  also the string belt was defective - basically about to come off.  looks like someone may have wore it and returned it.  was not flattering at all.
1,"Color change in wash shocker! These pants are a heavier twill than the pilcro chinos i bought from retailer earlier this year. these weightier wide leg trousers have a perfect drape. my size is between a petite 26 and a petite 27. the size petite 26 fit me well so i judge them to be a 1/2 size large. 
if i had written the review before washing them i would have given an overall rating of 5 stars. after washing once in cold water detergent and regular wash, the color lost a lot of blue. the color went from a wonderful fresh/sp"
1,"Great for pregnancy I'm 7 months pregnant and bought this dress yesterday, it is perfect! the wrap design makes it possible to expand the skirt and still look cute. i'm 5'3"" bought the small and look forward to wearing this after i deliver as well."
1,"Perfection! I am wearing a bodysuit and long skirt from bhldn for my wedding, and i bought this skirt to change in to for my reception. it is perfectly elegant, yet simple. i cannot wait to wear it on my big day! it can be dressed up or down so easily! love it!"
1,"Great pants, too long for short people I love the look and design of these pants. i'm 5'1, 110lbs and i ordered a 25p and still had to get them hemmed to even fit like pants. on the model, these look cropped but mine were even too long to be pants when i got them. i love the pant but if you are a petite, be ready to need alterations to the length!!"
1,Ruffled daisy sleep top The floral print and colors are so pretty for summer that it's tempting to layer this over a seamless tank and wear it out!
1,"Lightweight & comfortable I bought this in xl and it fits just as shown. i could size down to a l and it would still fit because there is a lot of flow to this top. so, if you want a more tailored, but loose fit, then size down.

 but, it isn't boxy. and, the deep v is sexy, but not immodest. and the pocket looks like silk, but it's just polyester. the pleating in the back gives this movement or move-ability, like when you drive. there isn't much pull. 

it's a thin light material and very cool for hot, humid summer"
1,"Love This is such a beautiful top, so flattering, soft and comfortable.  it is great as a layering piece.  the colors are vibrant.  the blue is a gorgeous blue, a deep cobalt blue.  i got one in every color."
1,"Beautiful top, but a little itchy This top looks as pictured on the model. the color is great and true to the pictures with the light faded spots, which i really like and make it more interesting. however, i am on the fence about keeping it due to the itchiness of the fabric. the itching is mainly on the arm holes as it is tight to the skin. i wanted this top for when i'm feeling a comfy casual look. however, i'm not sure how comfy i'll be if i'm itching. i may over look the scratchy fabric as the color and fit of the top are gr"
1,"Adore! but the white *is* sheer I own this in the dark blue and adore it. i read reviews later as i was pondering buying the white (why is it so hard to find a white shirt anymore that isn't see-through?!). one of the first reviewers raved that it wasn't see-through. i ordered it and ... nope, it's totally see-through. i tried it on and immediately saw the entire outline of my nude bra, and worse still - my belly button. back it went. i got the green instead. bummer about the white - fabric's different than the others."
1,Love this dress! Beautiful dress that is very flattering! wearing it to my bridal shower.  more appropriate for spring or summer!
1,"Beautiful basic! a find! This is a very appealing and flattering tee! the details really make this quite lovely: the back pleat makes the fit fabulous and motion ideal, the stitching at the neckline is attractive and artistically pleasing, the proportions are balanced, nothing too full or tight. although the tee is 100% cotton, the pocket is 100% polyester, quite silky and a nice accent. i bought the ""white"", which is more of an ivory and gorgeous, with complementary deeper ivory stitching. my usual medium fits great (s"
1,"Pretty pant These are very pretty and comfy. the split in the leg runs a little high for me, so i will probably have to tack it. i ordered a medium (i'm 5'9"" 145 lbs usually wear an 8) but these were a bit big on me, so i've reordered a small. also, the 'blue' looks more like black with tan stripes."
1,"Super soft & comfy Love these chinos, super soft and amazingly comfy.....and quite flattering for wide-leg pants!"
1,"Best jeans on the market Ags are the only brand of jeans i wear. they fit beautifully and last forever. i like the slightly higher waist of these angels... very comfortable and flattering, with the perfect amount of stretch.  be warned, unless you're 7 feet tall, you'll probably need to shorten these. typically i buy the angelinas, but they're hard to find nowadays. ag, please don't stop making petites! one more thing... try them on before you cut off the tags. i bought 3 identical pairs and returned one, as the fit was"
1,Beautiful runs very small Size up i was surprised that the fit was small i always seem to wear a 6 in retailer pencil skirts this was tight!
1,"Elegant! I purchased this in london, early april, and i wore it to a summer wedding. it was perfect and hangs very nicely. the colors are rich and the deep blue flowers have texture. the front slit goes up to about the knee but doesn't split apart when walking which i appreciated. the only thing that i felt was a little off was the circumference of the sleeves. i have to keep them unbuttoned but thankfully it looks like just an interesting detail and not so much like an unbuttoned sleeve. a definite keep"
0,Not for the price Very orange. the slits in the back are larger than pictured and not at the cutest part of anyone's anatomy... shorter in front and i have a short torso. the fabric is nice and lightweight.
1,"Just as pictured!! This top fits tts. the sweater part is cream, eyelet material is white. love it!"
0,"Off fit I actually had no problem with the neck hole of this shirt, even with the xs size. however, i had a huge issue with the bottom eyelet section. it's so tight! it stretches across my thighs and looks so funny, as the top part is still loose. i tried moving up to a size small and still had this problem. maybe just not for girls with thighs ... very strange fit."
1,"Cool, funky too I love this top. i wish i had more like this to cycle into my wardrobe"
1,"Classic with a twist I have been on the hunt for a black pencil skirt. so i decided to give this one a try based on the previous review. i love it! i didn't size up, went with 0p (26.5 in waist, 115lbs, 36 ish inches hips). the waist is fitted. the stylist said when she tried it on, it pooched, but i didn't feel that way on me. i had a simple t-shirt on and it looked so cute. the petite length was also perfectly on point. the lace part hit me above the knee, and the lining a little over that - perfect and flattering"
1,Love layers I loved the layered look without all the bulk. the different textures make it so interesting.
1,"Great top I like the casual look of this top.
like previous review - it doesn't have buttons or zipper, so a little difficult to fit into - pullover your head."
1,"Gorgeous! Just gorgeous, the dress makes a nice transition piece for early fall! perfect in every way!"
1,"Great colors I loved this dress after seeing it online.it is a pullover dress, and is easy to get on. my major problem with the dress is that the waist is extremely high (about 3 inches over my natural waist), and i usually have no problem with the placement of the waist in dresses. i'm going to keep the dress because i like everything else about it: the fit is flattering and the dress will be seasonless here in california. i""ll search for a wide belt to cover the waistline, or perhaps skip a belt altogether"
1,"Super cute Can't say how much i love this top - ordered on a whim and when it arrived i was so pleasantly surprised. the sweatshirt fabric is thick, the under layers are high quality sheers. super easy to dress up or down - i wore it to a (casual) company holiday party and got tons of compliments. bonus that i just had a baby and the top seemed to hide my not-quite-prepregnancy body, but will also look great when i am back in shape. a definite keeper!"
1,"Mixed feelings The print on this dress is gorgeous---but the material does not stretch whatsoever, and there are not zippers or buttons to ease in the fit. i always, always, always wear a size zero. it was a massive struggle to even get the dress over my head and on to my body. i felt like i was getting crushed! once on, although awfully small, the dress is just beautiful in every way. so chic! i just returned it and ordered two sizes up---here's hoping it fits!"
1,"Size up! The only reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is way too small in the chest if you have anything up there.i usually always wear size 4 dresses. not in this dress! this beauty is a full size too small. trust me it is gorgeous but there is no stretch. it needs a zipper . that said, i exchanged it for the size 6 and all the flaws that i've read in reviews disappear. the sleeves are better and it falls nicely and is comfortable. also, there is no lining. just good to know.once you get it ov"
1,"Should've gotten a larger size I purchased this jacket in my usual size s, but wish i would've chosen the m. the small works, but the sweater sleeves are tighter than i would've liked, making it hard to layer other clothes underneath. the sleeves are also just a little too short."
1,"Cosy and roomy This is a very nice top, but it is very loose and swingy indeed. i sized down one size, and it still is very relaxes. the material is soft, the colors are nice."
1,"In love with this dress! I really love the colors of this dress - very unique and classy combo. little bit of a retro look to it. even though there is no zipper it's somehow fitted and flattering. i plan to wear it to a wedding this summer in the mountains where it gets chilly in the evening so i'm thrilled to find a summer dress with sleeves. it will work well for plenty of other occasions too. only problem is the buttons on the sleeves are nearly impossible to button. just too tight. for reference i'm 5'9"", 140 lbs an"
1,"Calia tunic It's still a bit cool here in minnesota. however, it won't be long before i can wear this lightweight, drapey but figure-flattering blouse. i am 5ft 3in and the 0 petite, fits well."
1,"Super cute These are super cute and i love the ties on the legs. fit is true to size. i bought them on sale and they had some black marks on the front when received. i called retailer and their great customer service guaranteed that i could return them if the black did not come out when washed. it did, so i'm stoked."
1,Whimsical This is a cute blouse. i get lots of compliments. i bought the natural color. super flattering. i bought my normal size in most retailer stuff and had to return for bigger. the chest area is a bit snug. had to send back for a larger size.
1,"Everywhere top Super comfortable top. easily washable, 2 options with the sleeves, and a nice drape to the fabric. truly a go-anywhere top."
1, I love these jeans. the fit is much better than the white pilcro hyphen slit jean which is cuts lower. nice weight. not to heavy and not too light in weight. these look terrific with the vanja peasant top in the yellow print. a darling outfit. the lace give them flair and dress them up so i can wear them to work. highly recommend!!
1,The lace up makes it! Such a cute jean! got these specifically for the tie up lace ankle (and price)! also love the shade of gray i bought.
1,Cozy You know how you look in your closet and things just say i'm perfect for today. this top is like that. i got it a few weeks ago and have worn it often because it is so easy and hangs really nice. i bought the black one and am considering the off white one.
1,Flattering top Im normally an xs and i bought size 2 and it fit great. very slimming and looks great with white capris.
1,"Calia tunic, yes and no I bought the calia tunic in blk/wht and in red motif. i love the black and white one. the cut is flattering and stylish. comfortable. you can dress it up or down. all good. 
the red motif is cut differently. the neckline is very low. the shape is different from the black and white one. i am not sure why but i returned it.
neither shirt is as long as the one pictured on the model. i would recommend the black and white one though."
1,Great shirt!! Love the shirt and style. shirt looks better in person than online picture. i would get a size down because it runs a little big.
1,Very cute print! Very cute print but runs large. it is really long too.
1, I love this top and the relaxed fit. can be dressed up or down. i bought the bird print and liked it so much i purchased the umbrella print. now i'm contemplating getting the mixed dot! easy to just throw on with anything and the mix of colors keeps it versatile too!
1,"So fun I love bows,
this dress is very cute and flattering, while being comfortable. it may be sleeveless, but i think with the right boots and cardigan, it can be brought into fall easily. color is a nice green. i tried on both the 00p and 0p, and though i loved the fit of the 00p better (width), i preferred the length of the 0p - otherwise, not much difference there... i think it is well worth keeping it, even though i don't need yet another dress... material is pretty comfortable too. back is lower"
1,So cool Really adorable and very retro looking.. fits true to size but i got it a size larger because i wanted to tie up the bottom.. have had it 3 days & have worn it twice already!!!
1,"Unique t I love this unique t-shirt. the fall colors and ranchers theme are perfect with skinny jeans and boots. a western look that's feminine. the shirt is very soft, ordered my usual size small, a little long but good for tucking in."
1,"Confortable This top is so nice i bought it in 2 colors. washes well but does need to be ironed. 
fits true to size."
1,"Unique & colorful graphics/stitching; runs large I picked up this t-shirt at my local retailer today, immediately drawn to the super cute, colorful graphics, and the unique stitching at the collar, saying ""giddy up!"" to go with the cowboys, horses, cacti, and movie camera, (unusually!). the graphics are way cuter in person, as compared to the weirdly wavy-distorted and unclear photos shown online. if all i had seen was these photos, i would never have even noticed or recognized the design. go to your local store to see this in person, and you wi"
1,"This is a great blouse I ordered a size 10 in the neutral motif and it fits perfectly and it looks great. i am 5'9"" 145lbs with 38"" bust. the sleeves are the perfect length. i couldn't be happier with this purchase."
1,Unique tee Ditto on the oversized comments. am generally a large in tees and sized down to a petite large and probably could fit nicely in a petite medium. the stitching on the neck and front design are adorable. a bit long but great potential for layering to showcase the writing on the collar or cute design on the front.  think it's a keeper!
1, The tshirt is comfy and has a little curve on the tail which is fun!
1,"Excellent, comfortable, dressy or casual I'm in love with this top! i usually wear a s/m or 6, and the size 6 fits perfectly. the cut is very flattering and i love that the sleeves can be worn rolled up and buttoned or down (and when they're down they hit right at the wrist, not too long or short). it's lightweight and comfy, but looks really pulled together. i can see myself wearing this both with ripped boyfriend jeans and sneakers and with dress pants and a blazer. a great transitional piece.

i only wish this came in solid white (o"
0,"Beige blah The fit was fine, but the fabric (the beige option) was bland. it washed me out. granted, i'm fair skinned, but it reminded me of sour milk. it's getting returned."
1,"Great buy! I bought these for next year. ordered both 27 & 28 and kept the 27, which i would say is a pretty true 6."
1," Runs large, but very beautiful and sexy! the straps are elastic so better to size down."
1,"Love pilcros! Love white jeans and these meet expectations. i'm 5'9"" and 145lbs and usually wear size 29 in pilcros but these run a little roomier than others i've bought. going to dry them to see if i can shrink them a bit, but still fine and super comfy. ties on the bottom are fun."
0,Not white... The design of these is adorable with the lace up ties however they are a dingy looking off white color. they are also pretty see through. returned.
1,Very cute shirt This shirt is very comfortable and i received a lot of compliments when i wore it. i bought the neutral print and everyone wants to get close to see what it is . i would buy another if it came in this type of pattern.
1,Love this blouse! This is a comfortable pretty blouse. i purchased the neutral print and am very pleased with it.
1,"Grass green We always hope that the dress looks just like it is pictured i would say that this dress is more of an emerald green rather then a paler mint green . that said it is very forgiving stylewise because it does not cling and show your lumps and bumps . however the material is very thin like a sheet. length is good it is right to the knee on my 5'3"" frame. armholes are well positioned and not too big as to show bra or undergarments .
 not so sure how it would hold up over an evening or afternoon wea"
1, I bought this top in the stripe and i'm ordering the black now. it's a nice top to transition from summer to fall (even though the temp. doesn't change much in texas...#. it does run a bit large so size down. held up nicely when washed #hand wash cycle).
1,"Great skirt, but size up a lot if you're curvy I understand this is a pencil skirt, so it's gonna be more body hugging. however, this really did seem to run small. i only tried it on because it was on sale and there was a promotion. my thoughts below:
___________
pros:
- great design that will match with a lot of things.
- very soft and comfortable overall due to being part modal. lots of stretch.
- no dry cleaning here. hand wash, which is a plus for me.

1,Love love love I got two of the shirt am totally in love with them. i didn't get the one in black only because i have too many things in black. the shirts look awesome with leggings or skinny jeans. i'm very happy with this purchase!!!
1,"Adorable capri jean! I tried these on in in a 27/4 in the store and they were a bit snug. they graciously offered to look online and found the 28/6. they arrived in less than a week and are perfect. a note was enclosed saying they actually ran out of this size but another store was able to find them and ship...i love that retailer did not even call and worry me over it, they just fixed the problem. thank you!"
1,"The perfect top This top is very flattering, the fabric flows and moves. it fits perfectly (slim cut), but hides tummy bulges and other imperfections. and it's slimming too. can be dressed up or down, goes with everything. i ended up buying all three colors, and if there were more, i would buy more!"
1,"Perfect summer jean They fit snug and accentuate all the right curves. they could be shorter. the lace up sides are interesting, but i might sacrifice the lace ups for making them shorter. actually they are cuter on in person than in this photo."
1,"Sweet! I bought this in the black and white and like it a lot. i typically wear an xs or s, and purchased the small. glad i did because i think the xs would have been too snug. i like the tunic length and the fabric feels soft and smooth. it's a little low cut for me, but i'll wear a cami under it."
1," I love this top, but i washed it once, in cold water, and hung it dry. it shrunk just enough that it's now too tight around the bust and gaps open up between buttons there. so disappointing! i will have to send it back."
1,Great tunic I love this! i pair it with jeans or leggings and it works wonderfully. it's comfortable and stylish and a necessary addition to my wardrobe. it's a staple piece that i know i'll be able to use for years.
1," Love everything about these pants. a little sheer, but super beautiful and comfortable."
1,Love this shirt I wasn't sure how the fabric would be since i ordered it online but i wasn't disappointed. its got a lot of movement which makes it really comfortable while still being cute. it's a little longer than i anticipated but i don't mind that. it just gives it a little more versatility. also it has pockets!! i love pockets so maybe i'm a little biased.
1,"Great stable manner I saw a sales associate (sa) wearing it at my local retailer and totally loved it. this t-shirt runs very large, so it depends on how one wants to wear it. the sa wore it oversized and tied to the side, super cute. i tried on a regular small and it was still 2 sizes too big and too long on me. i ordered the xs petite and it fits perfectly, not too fitted and not too loose (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). my mother was a great embroider and the ""giddy up"" embroidery work at the neckline and the"
1,"Fun and stylish These are a different take on the white jean. thick enough that you don't see undies. cool lace detail on the ankles. i have very long legs, so they hit me a little higher than described. i did undo the laces a bit to give them a little kick at the bottom. i love the fit of the plico jean. i own a few pairs and they sit just high enough on my waist so when you bend over your bottom doesn't peek out. i usually wear a 27, and they aren't too tight and have a bit of stretch, but don't loose their s"
1,"Perfect for work and going out! Love this top! you can definitely wear this out with jeans or with dress pants for work. it can be dressed up or down, so it's very versatile. the red motif is a gorgeous color for spring and summer. received lots of compliments!"
1,"A little hippy but beautiful design I got the orange motif skirt in s. i'm 5'3"" and 130 so it fits snugly but doesn't need hemming, which is great when you're petite. i love the design and that it has pockets, but it's a very full skirt and seems to visually add a couple of pounds to your middle if you have a shirt untucked over it. but it's beautiful worn with a tighter shirt tucked in. the color is more red than orange to me as well which is a plus!"
1, Beautiful top! the body flows nicely and the colors are wonderfully vivid. it goes with everything and looks great for work or going out. my only gripe is the sleeves are really tight. i struggle a little to get on and off but once on it looks awesome.
1,Beautiful draping & dark green color I bought this in size xl in the moss color. it fits true to size. it's very comfortable--the fabric is soft. i love the draping of this top. i'm a pear-shape and this type of cut is my favorite. the moss color looks black online but is really a dark forest green. i'd love to see this top made in other colors.
1,"So elegant Received today, the fit is true to size quality fabric beautiful color. will go with so many things!"
1,"Nice jean but righter green than shown First of all, this jean fits really well, but i usually wear a 31 in mother jeans and i had to go up to a 32 in these (ugh!) because they just ran smaller or whatever. i am curvy on the bottom but the 31's just felt too tight and pulled everywhere.

second, the color is not quite right in this picture; it looks more military green. it is not - it is a much brighter military green vs a moss green. that is throwing me a bit. not quite as versatile or neutral to me.

meanwhile, the styling with the"
0,"Tight armholes I loved this shirt and attempted to buy it - however the armhole is so small i couldn't barely get the shirt off and almost had to call someone into the dressing room to pull it off of me. i'm usually a 6 and i tried on the 6 and 8, and both shirts had the same problem. it wasn't exactly the sleeve that was too tight, but the arm hole that was not big enough. it pulled across the top of my chest and was not roomy enough to slip in and out of. which was odd because the rest of shirt was fine. i d"
1,"Perfect! Could not say enough great things about this jacket. nice quality and drape and such a wearable, comfortable option as opposed to a more structured blazer. nice, true to size fit (petite small was perfect on my 5'2"" 115 lbs frame--not too tight and not baggy, sleeves still 3/4.) will order an petite xs for my daughter, too. retailer, i would definitely buy other colors if you decide to order them."
0,"Huge and shapeless I have a pair of mih jeans that are the only jeans i own that i absolutely love. everything about them. this jumper looked versatile, useful and fun, so i splurged during the 25% off dress sale.

my experience with mih is that the sizing runs true, or european, and thus small. i ordered this in a medium and it is gargantuan as well as virtually shapeless. it looked horrible from every angle: front, back and sides. i cannot imagine it having more fit even in a smaller size.

the fabric is nice, p"
1,"Wow!!! I hesitated to order this for a long time but am glad i did. i was concerned that it would have trouble staying on the shoulders, and would be unflattering to my large chest (34f). however, it is surprisingly comfortable and secure (has some kind of rubbery grips on the shoulders that keep it in place). very well-designed, and actually supportive to the chest. it offers the sun-protection i am looking for (i am also very pale and tired of getting odd burns on my stomach and chest), and as i head"
1,"Perfect ! These jeans are my new favorites! very flattering cut and color, and very high quality. i've worn them a ton since i got them, and they haven't stretched out or lost their shape at all. only thing i would caution is that they run small... for reference, i wear a 26 in paige denim, a 27 in citizens, and 28 was perfect in these."
1,"Love!love!love this suit I was really intrigued by this swimsuit when i saw it online but i wasn't sure how it would look on me but the reviews convinced me i should get it and figured if i didn't like it i could just return it. i love this suit, the color is beautiful and the high neckline is off-set by the open back. for anyone who has a large chest, which i do (32g), this is one of the most secure/supportive swimsuit i have ever tried on. do not hesitate to buy this suit, though i would go a size up if you have a lar"
1,"A must have closet staple This was my favorite piece in my order. it fit so well that i immediately went online to see if they had other colors. they don't. i voice the other reviewers opinion: get more colors in of this style. i would order in a heartbeat. i plan on wearing this to work (it's freezing in my office) but it is versatile enough to pair with jeans for a casual look. the material was soft, woven tightly (a good thing) and well made. good one retailer! definitely a keeper."
1, This was surprisingly more complimentary and easier to wear than i though it would be. i love vix bathing suits and the quality is exceptional!
1,"Great quality, perfect jeans!! These jeans fit so well and are made of really high quality denim. soft and comfortable but not too much stretch...just enough. i'm short so i have to cuff them. i kinda wish they came in petite or ankle length, but they look cute cuffed too."
1,Light and flowy This shirt is very flattering on. it's perfect to wear to work and also in a casual setting. it is rather short so it would be best to pair it with high rise pants!
1,"Sleek and well made This is a very well made swimsuit with soft foam cups and fully lined. the shoulders stay put with thin strips of foam that are sewn in. very comfortable and easy to move in; my arms have full range. the color is like the online photo, and to the teal close-up i posted of the shoulder area.
.
the size 'm' that i ordered fit my bust very well with smooth lines and decent support. i'm 5'2"", currently 33-25-37, 30d / 32c bra, with a average to long torso with a full bottom and thighs. i think the"
1,"Gorgeous lace! I was so pleased to receive this dress after purchasing it online -- the color is vibrant, the lace is beautiful, and it is fully lined! fit is true to size, and its a fit and flare dress so flattering for most body types. i could dress it up or down for lunches or weddings so overall, i think its a great dress for a great price!"
0,"Very cute, very small Despite other reviewers comments on size - i really wanted this one to work so i ordered it. i'm typically a size xs and d chest and instead i ordered a small. the body of the sit for well but the cups of the suit i'd said for more for a b. (if i lifted my arms i would literally come out of it) a final comment on this suit - it looked like there were these little sticky spots all over the suit like stickers had been removed. it was reticketed and it didn't really feel ""brand new"" when it arrived"
1,"Too big in the chest I'm a 14 bottom and a 10/12 on top, so i'm curvy, which makes one-piece swimsuits hard to shop for. i ordered a m & l, and while the m overall fit me better, the cup size was still way too big on me. i'm a 34d, and i need another set of my 'girls' to fit into the cups. otherwise this swimsuit is so beautiful!"
1,"Gorgeous suit with unique detailing I love this suit, and have gotten so many compliments on it. i weigh 106-108 lbs. and ordered a s. typically i order xs but am glad i went with the size up. the coloring is beautiful. the legs are high cut / flattering. the top has no padding, and shows a seamless result. highly recommend!"
1,"More gorgeous in person This dress is even prettier in person. i'm 5'5"" and usually a 4 in fit and flare dresses and got this in a 4. fits like a glove and hits right above my knee. the hook and eye closure does get caught on the delicate lace, so be careful of that. otherwise, this dress is perfect for summer weddings!"
1,"A little bit tough.......and comfortable I have a number of mother denim items (jeans, skirts, etc) in a variety of sizes and, unfortunately, i find mother sizing very inconsistent. this skirt is no exception! it is, as expected, high quality: primarily cotton with a fair amount of stretch; very soft; frayed at both the hem and the waistband; and, it runs a little small, i have another mother pencil skirt in a size smaller that is actually wider than this skirt; still not sure if i'lll keep it."
1,"Beautiful dress Love this dress! very feminine and flattering. i would say that it runs true to size, or a little big. size down for a snug fit at the waist."
0,"Tight in the waist These were perfect in the legs, nice and stretchy, but problematic in the waist. i'm generally a 31/size 12, but i had to squeeze to get them to close.
they've already gone back. if you have a tinier waist they'd probably be fine."
1,My favorite socks I am so happy i decided to purchase these. they are the only invisible socks i've found that actually stay on my feet. all others always slip off my heel... these are great!
1,"Stunning These are really stunning. they look exactly like the picture with the pattern matching up perfectly at the seams. i love the mirror image pattern. they're just a bit snug where at first i thought i might not be able to get them on, but once on, they actually fit perfectly. so, i think that's actually how yoga pants are supposed to fit. i'm 115, 5'6"" and i got the xs."
0,"Cups size too big! Loved the design and quality of this suit but the cups seemed huge. i weight 135lbs 5'6"" and wear a 34c. i bought a large in this suit because other reviews said it ran small (normally i wear a size medium) i did like how it fit everywhere expect the chest. i'm wondering if the medium will still be too large in the chest and hoping the rest would still fit okay. not sure i want to go through the hassle to exchange and it not fit again! it's so cute otherwise and would be perfect if you have a la"
1,"Adorable! very flattering! This suit is better than i expected. i'm a large d cup and with this type of top style, i typically size up. i'm a 4 bottom but would normally would order a large top because this type of top runs small...not here. i ordered the large and, much to my suprise, it's too big. i'm sending back. i may order a small and medium just to be safe, but the cups are definitely not cut too small here. the bodice is very flattering with the black and white contrast. so pretty!"
1,"Unique and flattering swimsuit I purchased this for a recent trip with my friends and thought it was worth the price. the swimsuit is comfortable, yet flattering and all the patterns are really unique. i received a lot of compliments about the swimsuit! the one downside was that the fabric hook for one of the straps broke so i had to sew it back on. other than that, this was a great purchase! i recommend this to anyone who wants a very whimsical, but comfy swimsuit!"
0,"Boxy moo moo Disappointed :-(
this top has a boxy shape and looked like a mini moo moo on me. i have a similar shape as the model and it looked nothing like that on me. bummer! i liked the quality and weight (not too heavy nor too light) but shape is unflattering. it's going back."
1,"Flattering! The colors on these leggings are just beautiful!  the material is very soft and has a nice thickness to it.  no issues with see thru material.  i am 5'8"", 145, and i ordered my usual medium."
1,Great for work My local store offered this dress in a navy colorway with sky blue and pink embroidery. tried it on and fell in love! it fits well while being comfortable. my favorite part is the skirt - perfect flirty a-line. already bought matching cardigans and can't wait to wear this to work. so perfect for spring!
1,"Beautiful dress, imperfect fit for me I went to the store specifically to try this dress on, because i was captivated by the photos online but worried about the fit. it was just as pretty or even prettier in real life, but unfortunately i couldn't fill out the top. there was gaping even when i went down to a size 0, even though i mostly wear a 4 and sometimes a 2 in retailer dresses. (the 0 fit me everywhere else, which is why i'm saying this dress runs small.) would it have worked with a padded bra, or for someone with more cup size?"
1,"Very comfortable!! I love this skirt! so soft and comfortable, i wore it casual with black nike sneakers, a black loose turtleneck top and a moto leather jacket. i tried on the m and l and went with the m, so i would say it is true to size because that is what i usually wear. i'm 5'9', 145 lbs,
nice thick fabric, but not heavy, good for cool weather."
1,"Great for a special occasion I just purchased this dress yesterday in the navy for my anniversary next month. i have to say its totally stunning on. the embroidery is beautiful, extremely figure flattering and the dress is very well constructed. i have to disagree with other reviews who say it doesn't or won't work for bustier women. i am a 34 d, 5'8"" tall and normally wear a size 4. the 4 fits perfectly and the deep v-like neckline creates a very nice bit of cleavage. maybe too much for some at the office i would say, but"
0,"That's not a wrap I chose this dress to try to flatter an hourglass figure, but was disappointed. the fabric is a beautiful soft, fine silk, but unforgiving. the cut is not truly a wrap, and, with a fixed thin elastic waistband, was too short waisted for me. while the model looks elongated, the thin line under my bust created two poofy sections... not flattering at all. while i was drawn to the shape for my body type, it may be better suited to another. happy hunting!"
1,"Great fit and style! Loved this dress. i am 5'5"", 34c, normally wear a 2 in most. the 0 fit (a 2 wasn't available in-store), but i will say showed more cleavage on me than in the shown picture.

gorgeous dress- wish it were just a little less costly, but would be a great purchase for easter, weddings, etc."
1,Exceeds expectation The dress looks better than the pictures online. it also arrives quite quickly after i placed my order. i am about 126 lbs and 4p fits me perfectly. the embroidery is so radiant in multiple colors against the navy blue dress. i am very please with this purchase.
1," Very pretty dress, the blue is a little lighter than navy but is still really nice. the embroidered flowers are lovely as well. the a-line cut is very flattering on. i can't wait to wear this dress this spring!"
1,Love it This skirt is so cozy and comfortable. it is form fitting but has a lot of give/stretch. the material feels high quality and heavy without being overly hot. i am sure this will be a go to skirt.
1,Cute and versatile Great quality and works in many ways! highly recommend.
1,"Perfect floral dress I wore this to a gala and i plan on wearing it over and over again. the dress is very comfortable and looks polished. i wore this dress for 12 hours and did not want to take it off. the embroidery is beautiful and appears to be well done. i am 5'5 and the dress hit me 2 inches above my knee. i highly recommend this dress, i received so many compliments."
1,Beautiful dress The stitching on this dress is absolutely beautiful and very detailed.
1, Love this dress so beautiful embroidery is lovely....well worth the price!!!
1,"Love! One of my new absolute favs! so elegant and flattering. the dress is as appears online and it is true to size. i purchased my usual size 4 with 27"" waist, chest 34 b/c. note, that there is not a lot of give to the fabric, so busty women may need to size up. purchased with the minuet necklace!"
1,"Beautiful dress This is a beautiful dress. lovely fit. unfortunately, the fabric wrinkles easily. i had to return it because it did not accommodate my slumpy posture, and it was too much to maintain for me since i don't iron."
1,"Beautiful dress but not for large chests This dress is gorgeous, but if you have a larger bust size, i would not recommend it. unfortunately, it was not available in any nearby stores and i had to order online. the low cut looks cute on the model but realistically with a chest it ends up looking a bit too revealing. i am bummed because the dress really is beautiful!!"
0,"Flairs out at bottom I loved almost everything about this skirt. thick and lined and love the buttons. comfortable. the only problem was that the two sides flared out at the bottom, presumably from the buttons. i was torn, but in the end it just looked too silly and it was sent back."
1,"Really nice all around I'm 5'3"" and 160 pounds with short legs and got a large petite. it fits really well (a tiny bit too short but could just be my proportions) and the quality seems very high. definitely can be dressed up or down (good for a business casual work environment)."
1,"First time, but not last time, customer This is the first time that i have tried mother jeans, and i am a fan. these jeans fit tts, and the high waist is flattering and stays put. i personally am a big fan of the distressing - it's just enough, but not too much - and it's lined on the inside so it won't get worse. i know some people won't like that, but i did. also, they hit right below my ankle (i'm 5'5"") instead of being a few inches too long -- a major bonus. thus, they look great rolled or not. but perhaps most importantly, these"
1,"So pretty! petites will need petite sizing I'm 5'2"" 110, 32-24.5-32.5. i tried both the regular 0 and petite 0. the difference was quite substantial. sometimes if an item runs shorter or smaller, i can get away with regular sizing. the regular 0 was all wrong, and the petite 0 was perfect in every way the regular 0 was wrong! the petite sizing was perfect for top coverage, tamed the flare to just the right amount, and the length hit right at the perfect spot where it is supposed to above the knee. gorgeous embroidered detailing and versa"
1,"Great fit This dress is well made, great fit, perfect a-line. the bust was lower cut than shown in the picture, but it fits well even with a large chest. completely flattering and i would highly recommend!"
1,"Great pants These pants are my favorite! not only is the fit slimming and perfect, but i get compliments on the design every single time i wear them. i absolutely love these, well worth the money."
1,"Love this This is a great dress, i feel like it hides any imperfect spots including some armpit fat or belly fat. i have gotten several compliments on this dress because the stitching for the flowers is very high quality!"
1,"Pretty, but not the most comfortable I got the burgundy color and i do have to say that the color looks a little better online than it does in person, but it's not too much of a difference. this is a really cute thong, and if you're just trying to be sexy/romantic, then i think it would be fine and there's nothing at all wrong with it. however, i like to wear thongs just in general because i think they're comfortable and i like not having to worry about panty lines, and this is definitely not the most comfortable. the front pattern"
1,"Beautiful colors - but it's short! This is a beautifully designed and made sweater dress. really love it. however, there's no way that model is 5' 10"" in the photo because i'm 4 inches shorter than that, and the dress is 2 inches shorter on me. it's really not a dress, it's a tunic. i'm happy with it because it's so pretty, but i did think i was buying a dress. i just wore it with leggings and i'm happy with a beautiful tunic!"
1,"Beautiful, flattering high-quality dress This dress is a home run on all accounts. the embroidery is gorgeous, the fabric is high-quality, and the a-line cut is slimming. i found this dress to run true to size. i am 5'11"" and the length hits above the  knee--so it could be longer on shorter heights. i purchased the white dress initially and now have also ordered the navy."
1,"Boxier than it appears Interesting, slightly transparent fabric. neckline is not so open as pictured. body is boxier than pictured.
would recommend as a maybe."
1,"Black and white is adorable I got this version in the black and white and can't wait to wear it. it is very flattering on and will look great for those spring/summer events. the only thing that could have made this dress better would be side pockets like the fall/winter navy dress by the same designer had, but don't let that minor detail hold you back."
0,"Looks good but for specific sizes I am curvy and this top, while stylish and i love the pockets, just didn't do it for me. it made my shoulders look wider than they are, which is a big no no. it would probably look better on someone with smaller shoulders or slimmer. the wool was also a tad itchy - not too itchy, just a bit. in general i don't wear wool without cashmere, i also don't wear non-italian wool because it is a bit rough and my skin reacts to it. so i stick to wool cashmere blend or loro piana soft wool. this sweater s"
1,"Classic retailer quality and details Finally a dress that ticks all the right boxes: mostly natural fibers, lovely details, fantastic pattern placement, and an easy fit that doesn't require alterations.

1,"Pretty in person This dress is much prettier in person. the embroidery is very beautiful and the slight sheen to the material gives it a dressier look than i expected. the lines are simple, flattering without clinging or choking. it is a nice versatile dress that can be casual or fit for party."
1, The fit and design quality was grea! i love the fact that xxs petite is available online.
1,I love this skirt I love this skirt so much. it's so comfortable and flattering. the button design along the sides is adorable. it's got a liner inside the skirt that ensures that it's not see-through in anyway. it's a great buy.
0,"Not for the big busted I took a chance on this top because i loved the color and print. it is mostly as pictured, but because i have a larger chest, the peplum didn't hit me in the right place. it would probably work fine for someone thinner with a smaller chest. i was surprised that it was also somewhat sheer, which was disappointing considering the price. i returned it."
1, This product fit well and was soft and beautifully made.
0,"Design flawed I ordered this online, and took it back the day i got it. i could not fit the neck hole over my head, therefore i couldn't even see how it truly fit. i had high hopes for this dress."
0,"Sizing runs very large I am petite and ordered size small, and it came looking like gym sweat pants. the material was very nice, but in terms of the waist and length size, both run incredibly large. the cuff of the joggers are also not elastic at all, and hangs loose widely. will have to return this item, unfortunately."
1,"Pretty but sheer This dress is black and white as pictured (as opposed to actually being cream), and it fits true to size. i've found that this particular brand runs tight in the shoulders for me, but that isn't the case here. the cut is very flattering, and it's great that this has functional pockets.

i was excited that the skirt is fully lined, but the top is ridiculously sheer. even with a nude bra, this dress needs a camisole underneath it. it's so flattering, but i'm not sure if i'll keep it."
1,"Great. simple yet different black dress. This is my third velvet by graham and spencer dress and i was not disappointed in the least... i love the fabric, how it can be dressed up or down, worn with a wide variety of footwear and is comfortable at the same time. the fabric is breathable and i can definitely see this becoming something i will throw on with a simple necklace, leather jacket and sneakers or boots on the weekend for errands around town, then be able to switch out my shoes for drinks in the evening. it's a simple back dress"
1, Runs a little small in the shoulders/bust
1,"Large in bust This dress is lovely in person- light rose color and quality fabric. i'm a 32c and had to go down from my usual 2 to a 00 to get a proper fit in the bust and bodice. the full skirt leaves plenty of room to size down if necessary. this would work best on someone with a larger bust and small waist, but because of the cut i recommend trying on before buying. if you are smaller busted, the front tie can be adjusted slightly to get a better fit. the skirt portion is unlined, though, the fabric is thi"
1,Sexy and comfortable I love this dress. i didn't think that i would feel at ease as it is very form-fitting. but it is so comfortable! and warm. it is dressy yet casual. i have received many compliments.
0,"Disappointing I really wanted to love this dress. i thought i might be able to dress it up for a wedding i'm attending, but it was kind of a serious no go. first off, i ordered a petite size, but it was still longer than on the model--i'm 5'5', so not even technically petite, but i thought it might be a better length for me that way. it was not a great length, and the pleats and pockets (which would be great in theory) make the skirt fully (and pouffier at the waist) than i would have liked. i love the way th"
1,"True black & white staple I have ordered many black and white dresses and end up getting cream and black. not this one! this is truly b&w! i love the stripes, the length (at the knee, 5'5"") and the pockets! time will tell in terms of fabric as rayon is not the most durable. the collar seems to stay down which makes it look 70's but fabric tape easily fixed it. overall, i love it!"
0," I tried this dress on in an xs petite. the dress runs slightly bigger, it sort of looked like a tent on me, whereas other xs p dresses at retailer fit tts. the other thing is that the dress just doesn't look like an almost $200 dress. the band that runs across the bust goes under the arms too. it isn't sewn in though, and it was folding down under the arms, making it look like its ripping off. the collar too seemed to pull down right in the center, as if the material was too heavy to stand it's we"
0,"Yuck I love jumpsuits - except for this one. the fabric is blah. it's between plastic and the material that they make flags out of. the print is adorable and the buttons up the front are super cute. the tie thing that's just hanging there?  it's a tie thing that just hangs there. it doesn't  look good hanging, and it doesn't look good tied.  this jumpsuit had so much potential. i'm definitely disappointed.  for sizing reference, i am 5'5"", 135, 34c and a small was perfect."
1,"Gorgeous print I fell in love with the print, it is much prettier in real life. more teal burgundy on yellow and more vivid than it shows here. the waist elastic is too tight and high for me....would prefer it looser and not on natural waist. but i still bought it and am ordering a second one in hopes that the elastic tightness is varied."
1,"Beautifully made accessory piece I am short waisted, and generally a petite on the top, so a lot of these sweater vest toppers i find to be too long in the torso for me. this one, however, is the perfect exception. it is soft, but with some structure, comfortable, and not too hot for warmer weather climates during the spring. i bought it in seattle, though i live in dallas, and found it to be a perfect layering piece with a 3/4 white t-shirt and a jean jacket, while walking around the rainy city. 
fyi: 5'2"", short waist, broad"
0,"Disappointed I ordered this tee despite the price. the fabric is very thin and the quality was poor. nice concept for a tee, but failed in quality and value. it was returned."
1,"Worked for me! I ordered down a size based on other reviews. i am 5' tall, 110 lbs and a size 26 is a great fit. i ordered both the navy and turquoise colors. my only complaint is the turquoise color is not the vibrant blue in the photo but more of a green tone."
1,Beautiful dress!! I had been waiting for this dress to go on sale and when it did it was only available in a petite xs. the only reason i said it ran big is because it was a petite and i usually wear a regular. i am 5'4 size 2. the length is perfect and i have really narrow shoulders so the petite fit perfect. the details on this dress are just beautiful and extremely comfortable.
1,Sunny cheerful dress I love this dress. it is beautiful and the quality is superb.. i too found it tight in the neck area. i had to untie it as other reviewers have mentioned. nice casual dress.. very comfortable and perfect for vacation this summer.
1," I love these shorts!!!! i usually have a really hard time finding shorts that fit my pear-shape, but these are great. i bought in a few different colors and i definitely will get a lot of use out of them this summer!"
1,"Lovely dress I love this dress. length falls as shown on model. i'm not sure if this fits true to size or not. i am normally a medium and kinda wished i would have ordered a large. i find that the neck is too tight and have to loosely tie it. also, the lining is smaller inside and it ends up causing the arm hole areas to roll inwards. so i feel like the back end up being sort of cape like. it's rather weird. the large may have too much material though. but overall, i still love this dress minus those few fla"
1,"So pretty! Dress is wonderfully made. the fabric is soft and the print is beautiful.wonderful detail,especially the ties.  nice lining...not see thru at all.
mid calf length looks good with heels or flats.
lovely dress for a sunny day or an evening out!!"
1,"Size way down I'm 5'8"" usually a size 2/xs and i bought this in a petite xs. never would i have imagined i'd want a petite size but i accidentally took it into the fitting room. the shorter length and less billowy effect is much more flattering. that said it still hit just below the knee and is very loose and flowing, but in a good way. :)"
1,"Yes yes yes! I'm always looking for easy casual items that will withstand being washed a million times, and i think this one will fall into that category. it's a nice thick knit - durable yet soft and sooo cozy. length is fantastic for leggings. i'll basically live in this on weekends!"
1,Cute skirt! Great detailing in how it's made. may look best on someone who's slender. it runs small and will show if you have even slight curves.
1,"Very whimsical I tried on the xs in store i typically need petite) and it was a great length for me, i think petite would be too short for me to wear to work. the xs was a little snug on the waist, but the rest of the skirt fit perfectly, so though it was snug, i think i would still buy the xs. (stretchy band). the cream color/ivory is a nice summery color, not see-through unless you have dark unders. flirty and overall nice and airy for warm summer days. 115 lbs, 26-27 inches waist)"
1,"Warm and comfortable Although true to size, i sized up to improve pocket placement and for a longer and slouchier fit like on the model. the pockets in my regular size were almost too high up and made my midsection look bunchy."
1,"Nice bermuda shorts I thought these were very nice bermuda shorts. i have skinnier legs and i didn't see a problem with them being too baggy there. the olive color was nice, very comfortable material."
0,"Muumuu I thought it was the perfect dress by the picture but it ended up looking like a grandma muumuu. the color is nice, the neck is cute, but the form unflattering. i'm trying to decide if i want to taylor it or take it back."
1,Love! I would buy these pajamas in every color if offered. they feel wonderful to the touch and even better on!
0,"Runs large, not the most flattering fit I was so excited that retailer finally had some bermuda shorts for those of us that are 1) older and don't want to show off that much leg anymore, and 2) are ""curvy on the bottom"" and really cannot wear the shorter shorts. i ordered these immediately in the navy. i usually wear a 31 in pilcro jeans, and like the other reviewer observed as well, i was floating in these - not only in the waist but everywhere. the legs are big - but it's supposed to be a boyfriend cut so i get that, but they just are"
0,"Not good if you sweat ""down there"" I bought these for a trip to the caribbean. i sweat a lot. if you have ever been humiliated by having a ring of sweat around your crotch area, then i do not recommend these shorts in the moss color. this color and fabric do not camouflage sweat. i will spare you the photos."
1,"Use as a top! I decided to go shopping at my local co store and as soon as i walked in, i saw this skirt but it was used  as a top with green cropped summery pants on a mannequin. one of the lovely salesgirls decided she liked it better that way after she tried it as a top herself.  i tried it as well and love it as a top! she was small framed and my height and told me she sized up for comfort and she was correct. if used with a strapless bra, your regular size ( mine is a small) will be uncomfortable. howeve"
1,"Perfect for work or play Joggers are my new style this spring/summer i think. i love the simplicity of this style. the cut is perfect, very true to size. i like the longer length - perfect to wear with kitten heels, flats, or slip on canvas. this color especially is really versatile and make them my go to pants once a week for a perfectly put together outfit."
0,"Awkward on top Wanted to love this.. love rompers, but the opening between your chest was oddly designed, it was gapping and certainly couldn't bend over without showing lots.. fabric seemed heavy for the summer. all in all it was too full, made me feel frumpy.."
1,"This is my new summer go to! This jumper is so cute, it is soft, and you can dress it up or down depending on where your going."
1,"Great top, but adds volume to the midsection I loved this top on the mannequin, so i had to try it on... i am a 36c and normally wear an 8-10, i tried on the medium and it fit great. i have to agree with the other review that the pockets make you appear curvier.. but you can always take to a tailor to have them removed..i just folded the bottom part over for a slouchier look.. i've already received tons of compliments and plan on ordering the blue as well.."
1,"Just as soft and stylish as the pants I was very happy to see these longer length shorts (i have 2 pair of the shorter ones and loved them last summer) so i ordered them immediately. i am curvy and wear a 29 in pilcro and ordered the navy, which is a lovely color and will go with everything. i think they fit great and i like the fact that they are a looser style. i will buy more when they go on sale."
1,Great fall sweater I saw this sweater at the store and instantly love it. it run large. i am 5'8 and 120 pounds and usually a size s in most retailer tops. i had to go with xxs on this one so def size down.
1,"New favorite sweater Great, easy to wear addition to the wardrobe. i wore it all day today and no pilling! plus the pockets are really convenient...they are a good depth for car keys or a small wallet. i'm pretty busty (32ddd) and have a curvy body...with that said, the small fit well. i prefer wearing it with the zippers opened because my behind and hips look odd with the sweater fully zipped...(for ref 36 inch hips). give this one a shot...it's a nice surprise."
1, Love this top! it's great for wearing with leggings. the material is soft and not too heavy. love the variation the zippers give you! i have in the moss and love it!
1,"Would it be wrong for me to just live in this? This is so ridiculously soft and conformable. it can be worn over workout clothes, or with skinnies or leggings. it looks fabulous either way. i wear mine the way the customer photo #2 is shown: meaning, folded over. but it looks great either way. the green is such a nice neutral: it looks great with black or shades of brown, tan, or even grey. the functional pockets are such a nice touch.
----------
my only ""criticism"" is this is a dolman-style/drop hem sleeve, which i am not a huge fan of - bu"
1,"Love the texture and color Love the texture and color of this tunic. it does seem to run large - i could have probably sized down to a pl without an issue. i do agree with other reviewers that the pockets are strangely placed and add bulk. i'm going to have them removed. overall, i really like it and have already worn it multiple times."
1," I am very petite, however, fuller on top (34ddd). this top looks fabulous! it is cut in such a way that every part of your body looks slimmer. goes with jeans, dress pants of skirt. i highly recommend."
1," This top is very cute. it is a high low top that i wasn't expecting, but love it. the picture doesn't do it justice it fits closer to the body than on model. fits true to size usually a small and this one fits well in small. got at a ridiculous price which is an added bonus. will get a lot of wear out of this top."
0,"Man shorts I was so excited to try these, it's hard to find cute bermuda shorts. the legs were so wide. my husband asked if i was wearing his shorts. they don't look that wide in the picture. i am 5'4"" and 130 lbs i bought my regular size 28 but the waist was huge i could have sized down one or two sizes. unrolled they came to my knee."
0,"So baggy I grabbed this dress to try on in my usual size, because i needed to see what the hype was about this style of dress, and it left me puzzled.  the print was pretty, but no amount of tailoring could save it for me.  it was wearing me.  maybe it could wear three of me.  i feel like this is a way for clothing manufacturers to cut corners, by making a garment without details (no installing more time consuming zippers, buttons or snaps, and making something that fits a wide range of sizes because it"
1,"Girly yet sophisticated Lovely, airy fabric and colors true to the pictures online. i am 5'3"" and 118lb. i ordered a regular s, and it fits fine. yes, it is midi length, coming to about 3"" below my knee. i would have preferred the 39"" length if it had been available, but it was not. still, i will compensate by wearing higher heels :-) the embroidered embellishment along the neck and sides stands out more than in the pic, and really makes this dress special. the cutaway shoulders give it sophistication. if you want to a"
0,"Looked too much like a nightgown The minute i put this on i knew it was wrong. firstly, the neck was quite tight and i had to untie the side tie. secondly, as i stood looking in the mirror, the dress simply read ""nightgown"". it was frumpy and too long on me. so back it went."
1," This is a beautiful skirt. i'm very pleased with the quality. it runs small though, i'm usually size small and went for the medium. i'm 5' 2 and got the regular vs petit, which would have been too short for me to wear at work."
0," I would say the skirt runs two sizes too small. i usually wear a size medium and based on other reviews, i purchased a large. i could barely get the skirt over my hips. even if it fit in the waist, it was much too short on me and i'm 5'2"". it's a cute skirt but it is fit for a tween."
1,"Stylish tunic This tunic is so stylish and pretty. the fit is close but not clingy (5'4, 116 lbs., size xs) and the rear coverage is just right to wear with skinny jeans or leggings. the fit is flattering whether the zippers are up or down, without riding up around the waist. the cowled collar falls around the neck evenly without the bulky look that similar styles can sometimes lend. the moss color is pretty, the fabric is soft and warm yet still fairly lightweight. if the pockets are properly tucked and layi"
1,Cute romper This is by far my favorite romper. it is very flattering and the material feels wonderful against the skin.
1,"Gorgeous, but it runs a little big. Beautifully made, incredible beadwork and detail. sleeves are extra long and a bit heavy (and cinched in multiple places, which feels strange), but the blouse is *gorgeous* and absolutely perfect for autumn. i'm gonna return and buy the size down."
1," While overall it's a pretty top, there were a few surprises. the biggest one not listed is that the bottom has a thin elastic band! without it, the top would be wide, longer and flow. in the picture to get it to the length shown, the elastic is pulled up toward the waist. which could work for some, as you can adjust the length into a tucked in look. it could be cut off, and sewn, making a normal flowy top. i am a normal size 6 and the shoulders are off, and the sleeve length is long with elastic"
1,"Beautiful on I waited so long for a small petite to come back in stock and finally it did...received the dress last week and it's beautiful it was a perfect fit for me not to big not too small (my size 5'3""/122lb). if you're petite or very thin probably size down. i gave it 4 stars because of the quality...some of the eyelets looked a little weathered. it is lined and there's no see through. agree with other reviewers though - this dress is not worth $228 price tag."
0," Yikes. there is a whole lot of skirt here. i am 5""4, weigh around 120 lb, and usually wear anywhere between a four and six in retailer clothing, depending on the designer. this skirt balloons out from the waist. on the website it seems to flow more naturally from the waist. i think that the flowers are cute but the material is cheap looking. the skirt is very long- hitting way below mid-calf. there is also tons of material - creating a parachute effect. definitely returning."
1,"Gray washed scoop tee Product was exactly what i wanted. very soft, but very wrinkled upon arrival. will wear it with skinny jeans or even leggings."
1,Cute summer dress I purchased this adorable dress to wear on vacation. it's such a cute fun print. i purchased my regular size xs and it's a good fit. the material is a little stiff but the print makes up for it. got it during the 25 percent promo ..
1,"Beautifully made but snug on top This sheath is extremely well-made, and the fabric is even more vibrant and beautiful than it looks in the photos. my only complaint: it does run a little small in the bodice. my usual size 4 fit like a dream everywhere but the top, which borders on uncomfortably snug. for reference, i'm a full 34b."
1,Beautiful details The details on this are beautiful. i love the gold thread and white beads. i thought the medium fit too large and got the small. it seems to fit really well. so you might want to size down one size. the only thing that seems a bit off it the length. it's pretty long.
0,"Wanted to like it so bad I love love love this print and had to have it when retailer had their 25% off sale. i think regular price is way too much for this dress as the dress isn't even silk or a better material. but once i got this i was so disappointed, i ordered my usual size and it was just a balloon/tent on me. i felt like i was wearing a maternity dress. plus the ruffle at the top which i thought was a sweet feature felt really awkward and like it was grazing my neck and chin in an annoying way. i don't even want t"
1,Hot mod mom This is so pretty and 60s like. i tried on a return size 2 and it really fit. i am usually a zero so i was surprised. the regular size fit me really well. length was perfect. pretty heavy and substantial though. love the 3 d effect. 115 lbs. 30 dd. 26.5 in waist
1, This shirt is very swingy but true to size. when i tried to size down the shoulders were too tight. the green color has great texture.
0,"Not great on me I thought the dress was ok, but was surprised by the cut away triangles of material right under bra band on the sides of dress. i will send back, also a bit too high waisted for me. other than that, the dress is as it appears."
1,"Pretty... Probably should have returned this but it's just so pretty. i got complements from strangers the very first time i wore it but it's extremely long. tucking it in will be tough-where do you put all that length? aside from that it is beautiful. the embroidery is soft and delicate light blues, gold, neutrals. hard to see in the pic but there are textured polka dots all over the shirt. great buy-i just wonder how i'll wear it or if the length will be too much and it will become a 'closet sitter'."
1,"Wowsa!! Love this dress. i think i scored the deal of the year with this one. found it in my local retailer store. it had been in my ""save for later"" forever but i couldn't bring myself to pay full price... then it sold out in my size online. i was in my local store browsing the new items on sale with the additional 40% off, and there it was 1, and only 1. and my size.... i picked it up, noticed the cut outs that are not very apparent in the online photos, but it back, picked it back up, put it back....."
0,"Pretty doily At 5'4"", i guess i am just too short to pull this dress off! the colors are so pretty for summer, but there is just too much fabric... i felt like i was wearing a giant doily! however, there is not a doubt in my mind that taller girls would look fabulous in this!"
1," Really beautiful dress, too special for me as a guest at a wedding. i think this can be used as a wedding dress in an informal intimate wedding. it is shift dress, so not accentuate your body which is to be expected. it is running small. with my athletic body especially up top, the chest/arms are tight. i could have gone a size up but the body might be too big. i unto lately returned."
1, Beautiful dress. i just wore this dress for my wedding. it was a beautiful wedding dress and i got many compliments on the uniqueness and the beading detail. there was one really big problem. the beads and the flowers kept falling off. i sat down and stood up leaving a pile of little flowers and beads. i could be standing still and they would periodically drop off. it was kind of embarrassing and everyone remarked that i was my own flower girl. i am still finding pieces of the dress everywhere.
1,Easy to wear not so much to take care I would never had bought this top if i hadn't seen it previously in the store. the look in the picture is not flattering at all (too frumpy with the wide pants). the many details work well with pastel tones. very bohemian look so make sure you balance that with modern bottoms and edgy shoes. might be a problem washing it because all of the details: mini pearls and golden thread but you got to do what you got to do...
1,"Beautiful top! When i received this top, i thought it was even prettier than the online picture. the colors and beading are more vibrant in person. it is a full cut and does have an elastic band at the bottom but i liked the way it looked on. i ordered my usual size m and it fit me the same as it did the model in the picture. it is pretty shear. if you wear it to work or during the daytime, it will need a cami. however, in evening lighting, i don't find it to be that see through and i feel comfortable wearing"
0,"Really hoped this would be my go-to winter dress When i saw this online, i wondered why this dress cost so much. i have been keeping my eye on it for some time. loved what i saw, the design and colors and details at the neckline and waist along with pockets but was skeptical. i was waiting for a sale to take a dive and here are my thoughts when i got it:
___________
pros:
- the colors you see online are exactly the same in person.
- the jeweled neckline is lovely. it's one thing that drew me to it. this dress had a very sophisticated appeal wh"
1,"True luxury I'm 119 and small frame, but took a chance and ordered the m. so glad...the fit was perfect. the robe is soft and beautiful!"
1,"Cannot get enough of this! This is beautiful and fits perfect. it's even prettier in person, and extremely comfortable and high quality. i'm 5'3"" and it hits right above the knee. the straps are adjustable and fits true to size. i bought an xs and it fits perfect. must buy for a sweet little night gown!"
1,"A ""slice"" of heaven! I ordered this dress with the 25% off everything code as it is a bit expensive. i will say it is well worth the price. from the material, to the design, and fit, i was truly pleased. i am usually a 4p in retailer dresses so i went with the xs-p and it fits perfectly. it is super cute and unique, and i love, love, love the pockets, which is always an added bonus. it is so fun and flattering, as i am sure people will be asking where this one is from. a definite summer must have. obsessed with this w"
1," Haven't decided if i'm going to keep this dress yet. it arrived torn at the seams, but was able to use two sided tape to fix and straps were sewn on twisted. in my opinion it is not worth full price. i would say it runs tts. i'm between and 4 and a 6 and the size sp fit perfect, however, the petite size runs pretty long. it says 47 inches from shoulder but i need to wear it with 5 inch heels. mine may have been a wrong size marked issue.
dress looks exactly as in the picture."
1,"Awesome high waisted skinny These are the perfect higher waisted skinny jeans. high enough that there is no muffin top, but not so high they look like mom jeans. typical ag super soft fabric. they are like wearing sweat pants. so worth the extra money for the ag jeans. love the length too."
1,"Add your own touches! I'm on the fence about this dress but overall i like it. the material, design and all is great! it's a light seersucker type fabric and short sleeves are perfect for summer. now the bad thing about this dress is partly the print combined with the swing/large cut. if you aren't too careful it can look like a housedress or hospital gown. i find i definitely need a belt to define my waist to avoid this."
1," This top came down to my hip bones, but i am short-waisted. the shirt definitely fits shorter than in the photo. the measurements listed for ""regular"" seem to be a bit shorter than the 26"" l measurement i got when i measured it. i think the quality is nice, and though it could likely easily snag if you're not one who is used to wearing delicate clothing, i didn't find this top to be flimsy at all. for reference i purchased a l and the fit is more form-fitting on me than it is on the model, but n"
1,"Great summer top I don't know what it is about this top but i was so drawn to it when i saw it in the store. it's totally see through, that's the design and i think it's great. i wear a cami underneath but if you're more daring or you spend a lot of time by the beach, you can get away with a nude bra or bikini top. this definitely runs small. i'm 5'5"" 120 and usually wear xs/s but felt most comfortable in a medium. the body isn't tight or anything, it's just on the shorter side, especially if you have a longer t"
1,"Adorable Very soft and comfortable, great for girls who don't usually like shorts because of bigger/muscular thighs. i would say these run large, but not drastically. for reference, i'm usually a size 6 on the bottom and i got a small. the girl at the checkout counter called them pajama shorts but i think these can definitely be worn out of the house."
1,"Beautiful top I love this top! it flows nicely and fits perfectly. i'm 5' 4 1/2"", 125 lbs. and ordered the small. i love the little bit of sparkle in the blouse, too."
1,"Beautiful dress This is a very beautiful dress, with the detail of the inside lining, with a very beautiful fabric as well, creating a double layer effect, it creates a great flow. i am not sure i would use it with the belt (which is beautiful, a part of it is crochet), but if i don't, the dress would be too long. i am a size xl and 5'6"", so if you are shorter than that, i would try it before buying it. since it's getting cold here in colorado, i'll have to wait for next year to really experience going out with"
1,"Beautiful top This is a gorgeous flowy top. i paired it with a pair of army green pants and have received a ton of compliments. you can dress this top up for a night out or for work, or style it for a fun evening out. you will be very pleased with this top."
1,"Great dress This is a great dress - it definitely runs true to size and is on the border of running a little small. if you're on the fence about which size to order go with the larger size.
the fabric moves nicely but wrinkles easily when packed. love the color.
got a ton of compliments :)"
1,"Adorable top I loved this top from the first time i saw it online. i ordered a size 10 ~i'm slim with broad shoulder & 36c~ the top fit perfect. when i opened the pkg i thought it would be too big since it looked wide but that was not the case at all. its a little longer in the back & a little shorter in the front. on me~it looks exactly like it does in the picture.its really a cute top & it looks lovely over shorts. makes a cute, casual summer outfit. i cant wait to wear it."
1,"Gorgeous fall colors I really wish this had fit me so i could keep the vest. beautiful colors and construction. i am 5'9"" with a 36c chest. the medium was quite a bit too small across the chest (i could not close the hook) but it fit perfectly around the hips. i did not want to order a large because i felt the boxy style would be too large around the hips even if the chest fit better."
1,Pretty and girly I bought this top in navy and am so happy with my purchase. it's pretty and feminine. it looks great with jeans as well dressing it up for work. very happy with this purchase.
0,"Runs very small This is a very lovely looking sweater. unfortunately, it runs incredibly small. i'm only 5'3"" and the size small hit me above my mid-rise jeans. it doesn't fit at all how it's shown on the model. it's also a very delicate fabric. seems like it would snag easily. i was really hoping it would work as i used my birthday discount to purchase it, but i'm sending it back."
1,"Gorgeous top This is a beautiful shirt. i purchased the top in navy, the silver touch is pretty. i usually wear a size 8 or 10 and m was perfect, tts. great for work or casual party."
1,"So soft The pattern is pretty subtle, almost looks like one color, so it is more versatile as i would have originally thought. the fabric is so soft, the collar is removable, but i love the look with it on. the way it closes is 3 lobster-like clasps, so you can wear it closed or open. sizing is a bit big, as in the xxs p fit me perfectly (didn't even try on the xs p. this will keep me warm, and looked nice with a pant outfit i tried on as well as a dress... recommend (sizing reference: 115 lbs, 30dd, 26"

0,"Weird fit I loved the look of this blouse online. i really wanted a cute eyelet top for summer. the blouse looked great out of the package but the fit was not good. i am a 00p and 32 b bra size, this top was too tight across my chest but billowed out in the back. its as if the armholes were too far forward. it is fairly short but i am short waisted. i really wanted this top to work but i had to return it. if i went up one size the back of the blouse would have been ridiculously large and the top was too e"
1,"Love it! I bought a size s in the navy, and m in the neutral, and both fit. i usually wear a small, but they only had the size m left in the neutral. the m is a little big, but the extra room fits the flowy, bohemian style of the blouse, so it works. i love this top and am glad i purchased it in both colors. definitely recommend it."
1," Bought both colors - nice quality top, but they do run large. for reference, i'm 5'4"", 115lbs and xs is still kind of big on me. wish they have xxs."

1,Favorite flar denim These are my favorite flare jeans! they have that lovely 70's style and go with everything and look great all year round. the fit is perfect. my all time favorite jeans.
1,"Love, love, love! I love this dress! the pattern is unusual along with the mesh cutouts. i'm a sucker for mesh cutouts. it does look a little bit like a maternity dress, but eh, who cares. let them think what they want. i recently wore it to a casual outdoor wedding and received many compliments. i knocked off one star for quality because the back of the dress where the zipper stops needed to be reinforced by hand to keep it from ripping. this is a common problem i have with retailer dresses, and no i'm not trying"
1,"Beautiful vest! Love this vest! since i am 66 years old i was hesitant to try on this vest because it was out of my comfort zone as to style, but my daughter convinced me to try it on. it is absolutely darling and looked so chic on. my 27 year old daughter bought it, too, so it is stylish for any age. the fur collar is fun and the fabric is very nice and the vest is well made. it can elevate jeans to a dressier look but still have a casual vibe. having a coupon the day we shopped made the decision to buy this e"
1,"Warm weather favorite The fabric is very light weight, more of a shirting material.  this surprised me because the dark flowers almost looked like flocked velvet in the picture.  the flowers are actually printed on cotton that has woven stripes.  it is so soft and light!  there is also a little webbing detail in the front yoke but nothing shows because there is a simple sewn in lining.  the skirt is not lined but the hem is weighted with a trim so that the skirt will hang right.  very flattering.  it does run big tho"
1,"Great boho chic dress I bought this dress for the summer, but it will transition nicely into the fall with a sweater, leggings, and boots. the color and pattern are pretty and without being washed out. the macrame belt is absolutely beautiful. it doesn't show up well in the picture, but is intricate and artistic. seems sturdy as well. i can't wait to wear it out!"
1,Love this dress I love that the dress slip got a different pattern. very easy fun for summer but you can also layer it in fall
1," Beautiful just like the photo. i love it. the length is fine, as i got the l. the quality is very good."
1,"Cute, but wide I'm. 5'2 and based on other reviewer's input, i went with a regular rather than petite and the length works well. the top is cute, but it billows out around the waist which isn't apparent on the model. other reviews mentioned that so i bought it anyway with that information and it's fine if you expect that. i'm a 34dd and find it to be a bit tight in the bust."
1,"Casual type dressy This blouse is perfect for semi dressy occasions silver ribbon adds a nice, subdued sparkle accent and no need to add a camisole due to the nice lining."
1,Just love this dress This maxi dress is exactly what i had in mind! the fabric is very comfortable. the print is very nice. perfect find!
1,Elastic too tight for me I'm 10mths post partum so my belly is still flabby. the elastic is too tight on my waist. i wish this was looser with a drawstring to tighten. i have to return it.
1,"Sized down - fits perfectly I most often fit into a size medium. based on prior reviews, i ordered this dress in a small and it fits perfectly. it drapes nicely. the fabric is soft and flows well. the under layer has a nice little stretch to it. the dress looks good with and without the belt. my favorite and most-slimming look is to just tie cinch and tie it in the back, such that it does not wrap around the front at all. the dress is so comfortable and the neckline is very flattering. no bra needed for my small bust."
1,"Nice work dress Very comfortable to wear, love the overall look of this dress."
0," Beautiful in pictures and i loved it before i tried it on. as the other reviews state, it is short and wide. i like the top so much, i am going to try to add some gathering across the back to offer some shape. otherwise it is an unflattering shapeless box :("
1, I own another pair of this brand and these are just as cute and fit the same. i wish the fabric was a bit nice but they still are super cute. they have wider leg holes which are flattering on my muscular build. nice and lightweight and sooooo comfy!
1,Love this soft pant These pants lived up to expectations. the fabric is very soft and did not wrinkle in the dryer. i am normally not a big fan of cropped styles but love that these have the gathered leg and can be styled dressier or casual. i thought the cargo pockets might stick out too much but they lay nicely. i feel i will get a lot of use from these and the best part is they are not constrictive and they are super comfy.
0,"Just ok In my opinion, for this amount of money, the dress needs to be something really different. and this one isn't. it has several structural issues and it seems to have a split personality (summery material, dark color, flirty and fun...but overly conservative up top.)

initially, the top portion is extremely sheer. you're saved (a bit) by the extra fabric at the front, but it still seemed odd that the top isn't lined - particularly for a dress meant for winter.

there's too much going on up top. th"
0,"Beautiful print but huge! This dress has a beautiful purple paisley print and reminds me of classic retailer from years ago. i wanted to love the dress but it runs extremely large. i usually wear a 00p or xxsp and got this in an xxsp but was still way too big. while the intent is to be flowy, i was overwhelmed by the bagginess and it changes the style from flowy to bag-like. while the belt helps cinch the waist, i had too much bunching in the waist area making it unattractive. very disappointed as its such a pretty"
1,Lovely embroidery This garment has the most beautiful and detailed embroidery on the front and across the top of the back. i purchased this blouse in pale pink in a xs for my daughter-in-law who is an retailer fanatic. i am sure she will look stunning in it. my only negative would be the silver accent thread across the front is overkill.
1,"Gorgeous, well-made blouse - fits perfectly This top is drop-dead adorable, very well made, and a flattering fit. i noticed other reviewers saying it is wide and short, but that was not my experience. it's a slight ""swing"" or ""trapeze"" shape, but fitted through the shoulders. so, if you are small-shouldered and small in the chest - this is a very, very cute top. for reference, i am 5'4"" and a 32c - and i took a size 2. perfect when paired with dark skinnies or capris. it's also delightfully well made with excellent detailing - the cute vi"
1,"Lovely dress! This dress is absolutely lovely, from the neckline to the fabric. really feels like a well made dress. i will say that it ran larger than i thought though, so keep that in mind. it is more of a shift dress than the pictures suggest. still gorgeous though!"
1,"Impressed, but... As a long standing retailer shopper, i have seen the beginnings of retailer great quality and detail and somewhat over the years disappointed of quality going down; this vest is so my style and executed very well as being fully lined and sewn well, hooks to close are substantial; the fact the faux fur collar can be removed is a real plus, but though the colors are delish, the fabric is a bit questionable.  the one i ordered on line and sent to me is fresh and not petted, but looking at the same vest"
1,"Gorgeous in person I'm so glad i saw this in the store, as the online photo does not do it justice. it's elegant, detailed, and a beautiful shade of pink. it has a little silver sparkle which makes it perfect for a casual party when you want to opt out of the traditional holiday colors."
1,"Adorable and comfy These are so comfortable, it's like wearing jammies outside. i love the pattern and you really can't be the comfort."
1,Great fit! These jeans are very comfortable. i really like the high waist. just what i was looking for!
0,"Totally see-through! I just got this in the mail and was so excited to try this cute top.....but it's completely see-through! unlike the photo shows, the lining is not included. quite a disappointment top is well made though no give in the fabric."
1,Cute but fit not right These are cute and light weight however the fit is off. i ordered my normal size large (i'm a 12/14.). the waist was large but fit ok. they were really tight across the theighs. the crop length is fine with my 5'9 height. if i hadn't got such a good sale of probably return them. they will be good lounge pants.
1,"Size down and fall in love Call my corny but this dress inspires me to run barefoot through the lavender fields in provence.  the flowy layers and dreamy prints are mesmerizing.  fit is ideal for my body type as long as you size down.  i had no weird sagging, bagging or poofiness.  and i love the macrame belt!  i tied it offset to the side but the dress looks good unbelted too.  i purchased the small petite. 

my stats for fit reference:  5'3"" tall, 140#, 36dd, 28"" waist, 35"" hips, wide rib cage, size m/l tops, size s/m"
1,"Pretty much beautiful I adore the tiny brand blouses! this one is lovely, and i feel new and beautiful in the navy with the sheer sleeves and bumpy, embroidered material, very pretty indeed. this probably is equally stunning in the nude color, but it doesn't show well somehow online. the navy is certainly amazing, and i was so proud to wear this blouse today for work with jeans. i always find the tiny sizing to be one size off. the large fits me perfectly, although i am a medium in most all other tops. 5.1"", 130 #, 3"
1,Runs large Gorgeous dress but fits really large. ordered a petite large. going to send it back and try the petite medium. wish it was available at my store to try on and not have to wait for it to be reshipped.
1,"Prettier in person! Love this dress! the colors are a smidgen darker than the photo shows, which i like even better. super comfortable, nice flow, great fit. definitely will be a favorite of mine for this summers"
1,Top This is a wonderful top. it looks great with jeans and shorts. feminine and clever design. many compliments.
1,"Love these jeans! These jeans not only fit well, i love the way the fabric feels. for denim the fabric feels soft on the skin. i am 5'8 and the inseam of 30 inches was perfect. they call them ""hi-rise"", but them seem more like a ""mid-rise"" to me which i prefer. i am going to buy another pair in a different wash."
1,"Love the dres Originally bought the plaid version and retuned it to order this one in the store to get free shipping. the fit is completely different. i am a consistent small, particularly in dresses of this style. will be exchanging this for a medium, which i hope will fit. love the color and pattern."
0,"Not like picture I really wanted to love this coat. it is well made and unique. i usually buy the petite versions but they were sold out.
however i went ahead and purchased a regular size because i wanted a second winter coat.
sadly, it looked more like a cocoon coat on me. it stuck out at the back. probably because it was not a petite. it pulled across my chest, like shoulders were too short. for reference, i am 5 feet, 109lbs, and a 32d.
i didn't mind the fluffiness of the top portion and the tie is useful for"
1,Coolest shirt ever The print is awesome !
1,"Fun color, interesting fit I'm tall and small chested so the dress didn't fit me perfectly. i adore the color and pattern, but wish it was less revealing in the chest area. i definitely have to wear something under. otherwise high quality and unique dress!"
1,"Cute drop waist cotton dress I just purchased this adorable drop waist dress on-line and personally found it to fit tts in my regular size small (34d-27-35). the length in the front hits right to the top of my knees, perhaps a tad longer so it's not too short for me (i'm only 5'4"") and the back is longer in length. there is also a detachable matching cotton slip that snaps on or off the dress that has adjustable straps that hit just above my knees. i love that this dress was made from cotton and the color is just as picture"
1,"Big difference between sizes I am typically a small at retailer, but always order a small and medium to try since i'm tall. the color of the green is really pretty, and i can see wearing it on the weekend with casual sandals, and dressing it up with a cropped jacket for work. the sizing is way off on this dress, though. the small is too short for me (personally). i'm 5'8"" and the waist doesn't sit low enough for a drop-waisted style. so i tried a medium. the medium is not sized correctly at all. i tried it on and it fits 3 si"
0,"Odd style I should have paid closer attention to the other reviews. i could barely get this blouse over my head! after getting it on, the armholes too are very small. the blouse other than that is pretty and very girlie. i love the pleating and dolman sleeves but i was strangled around my neck. i tried the small but think a medium wouldn't have been much better. it needs a button opening on neck and sleeves. i would have to put this on before makeup or doing my hair. 
if you have a tiny head and pencil a"
1,"Perfect for summer This dress got my attention in the store due to the bright color. it's like a tangerine orange that absolutely shouts summer. loved the asymmetrical hem and another plus was the pockets! they look completely hidden so the dress does fall flat. i thought this ran a little big in the chest area, which doesn't happen often. a size 8 worked for me, can't wait to wear this!"
1," Fit is ""breezy"" which is what i expected. a little on the loose side but comfortable and still cute. the slip that accompanies the dress is of decent quality as well.  the back of the dress is not that much longer than the front, as in the picture, but i still liked the dress enough to keep it."
0,"Overpriced I decided to take advantage of the free shipping despite seeing no reviews yet. i received the dress today and it is exactly as pictured, only about 3 inches shorter. i am usually between an xs and s but chose the xs because of late, everything i seem to order is huge. this was an exception and i could have ordered the s. color was as pictured, a nice green. fabric was a gauzy cotton. the dress was just ""alright"". nothing special to warrant the price tag. it felt like a little girl's dress on me"
1,"Very flattering The orange version is very nice, bright but not tacky. the fit is super flattering, and i love the crisscrossed hem. the top part is also flattering on the shoulders (halter), but need a strapless bra. the 0 fit me well, no need for petite on that one, might be too short for me.

(03dd, 26.5 in waist, 115 lbs).

pattern is also gorgeous. recommend..."
0,"Not worth it This top is very pretty, but it fits funny. it's boxy and doesn't hang well. i feel like you could almost wear it as a 2nd-trimester-pregnancy-blouse. i tried the small & the small petite. they both fit the same (too big and too boxy), but the petite was shorter. i am 5'2"", 125lbs, 34b. i preferred the regular length, but if you like your tops to end at your waistband, then the petite would fit too. i still really like the top, so i may try it in a smaller size when it goes on sale."
1,"Perfect dress for wedding! I have an hourglass shape and a large chest, so it's difficult to find dresses that don't like i'm wearing a sack or are too form-fitting to be appropriate. this dress is prefect for accentuating my waist, while still looking appropriate for weddings and other nice events! the color is perfect"
1,Perfect poncho! This will be my favorite fall acquisition! looks better in person. very flattering. does run large. love the combo of tan and grey.
1,"Cute cute cute This dress is so cute, and i received so many compliments on it! i wore it on a gameday, and it was so comfortable. i love the skirt of the dress because of the trendy v's. the top was too loose for me, so i had to get it taken in. this is surprising because i have a decent sized chest and broad shoulders. other than that, this dress is a real winner!"
0,"Sad top. I wanted to love this top. but, it looks like an ambitious 12 year old made it with rumpled fabric and lace found in her grandmothers attic. re: hopeful, but not good. the quality is not good and it hangs strangely on. sadly it is going back."
1,"Great summer dress I love this dress. it's a lightweight soft fabric. the blue layer is a bit thin, so you can see the stripped layer underneath which keeps this from being just an ordinary blue dress. usually i'm a size 0xs but got a 2 because i was worried it would be too tight in the shoulders (based on another similar dress from holding horses). the two fits great, the top and waist fit perfect and the bottom is nice and flowy without being too much fabric."
1, I tried this dress on in hawaii before it even hit the website. i am guessing retailer tests out their spring line in always summer hawaii. i was impressed but wanted to wait for a promo. there is a lining that fluffs up the skirt part of dress and makes it fun and girly. i sized up to 4p from my usual 2p in holding horses due to the tailored upper part of the dress and my shoulders a wee bit wide.
1,"Nice I did like this coat, however the material was just not what i expected. i was hoping for more of a traditional wool material, but this had a fuzziness to it. not fitted in the waist either, which might just be the style but not what i was hoping for."
1,"Tried on few dresses to find right size! Like other reviewers, i tried on a medium and a large as i usually take either size in retailer dresses. the large was huge on me - i had an extra 6 inches or so on each side. the next medium that i tried on could barely fit over my head! i looked at the tag to see if i had picked up an extra small but it stated medium. got another medium and it fit perfectly. however, the cami underneath one medium was again teeny tiny. the other medium was ok. you may have to try on a few dresses to get the righ"
0,"Seems that size is variable I am a true size small and i ordered this dress and it was way big. it's meant to be a relaxed fit, but it sagged under the arm-holes because the bust was way too big. some folks are saying it ran small and they are essentially the same measurements as me, so it makes me think there is possibly some variation in each size. i got on here to reorder in a smaller size, but now am not sure what to do as i need a dress with in the next three days!"
1,"Great casual summer dress (with pockets!) I don't love this dress but i really like it a lot, hence the four stars. i opted for the light blue. the embroidery is a rich, vibrant blue and quite beautifully done. i am 5' 6"" and 125 lbs. and the xs fits perfectly. it's intended to be a looser cut but it isn't at all frumpy and it hangs nicely. and it has pockets! all around a good summer staple."
1,"Pretty boho like This green dress seemed more fitted and tailored on the model. i ordered a small and medium in the green and mint (even though it says mint, it's a grayish blue). usually i'm a medium but even the small seems a bit big. it fits more like a loose boho dress rather than how the model wears it. the colors are vibrant and the embroidery is nice. i will be keeping both colors in small and just have to accept that the fit is similar to a looser casual summer dress. if you look at the pics that other c"
0,Disappointed I found the fit of this dress odd. i typically wear a 6 or 8 in dresses. the 6 fit across the chest but the armholes were large so wearing a bra would be a challenge. i am a 34c so i need some type of support. i also thought the fabric was a bit flimsy for the price. i am a huge retailer fan and usually leave glowing reviews but sadly i left this one in the store.
1,"Smock dress I love this dress. however, it's not what i expected based off the pictures. 

the modeled photo indicates that it's a shirtdress with a drop waist. no. it's a smock dress with more of an a-line silhouette that begins at the shoulders. the waistline is more of a detail, like the button placket, than a structural quality. it's very youthful and whimsical. 

that said, it is quite beautiful. the fabric does not wrinkle easily, as another reviewer guessed. my daughter wrinkled it sitting on my"
1,"Too bright for me I tried this dress on in the store. it fit okay, but the orange is so bright, i couldn't bring myself to buy it."
1,"""go to"" please offer a maxi for mature customers. Silhouette transcends many occasions."
1," Beautiful summery dress with bright fun print. i think this was well worth the sale price i paid. it lays nicely and is flattering. i went down a size from my normal 8 to a 6. however as other reviewers have said, the arm holes/halter top is too blousy and no matter how tight i tied it or type of bra i wore, you can see bra on the sides. i'm going to get this tailored and then it will be perfect. can't wait to wear this on my vacation!"
1,"Light weight, pockets, great for summer I run 170lbs., 36 d, 5'4"" and ordered a regular 14. probably could get away with a 12. i didn't order a petite because i wanted the length. however i ordered the 14 because it is cotton hand wash and thinking there might be some shrinkage. it fits to perfection everywhere - but the waist. it's very loose. they must have clipped it in at the waist in the back of this shot on the model. the picture doesn't clearly show the hi-low concept of the hem. i like that so it isn't a problem. very unique a"
1,"Jackie oh my gosh this is cute! Well, i just love this dress. great material. beautiful coloring! perfect length! true to size.
i love the pleated neckline! i feel like an old hollywood beauty in this dress. great one retailer!"
0,"I wanted to love this dress ... But, it just doesn't measure up. first, the slip/lining comes unattached if pulled slightly and it is very difficult to actually get it on - either stepping into it or pulling it over your head. and, once on, the top was a big snug and there was too much material at the bottom which made it look really bulky. unfortunately, i am finding this to be the case with so many of the items i buy from retailer lately. the material is really cute, but the dress isn't worth the price / effort."
0," This top was just not flattering. i'm 5'8"" and medium build, and the m was very bulky and the fabric didn't fall in the right places. made me look very round and i'm not, so it's definitely going back!"
0,"Misleading I sized down as other reviewers suggested (usually an 8, went down to 6) and the dress fit fine--but it was not attractive. the cut was like a tent with an empire waist. really just not attractive. maybe it has to do with my body type, but compared to the model, this dress was so unflattering in-person. returned."
1,"Cute dress size down I'm usually a 6 in dresses and the 6 here fit okay. loose but still flattering a little long for a sundress. i was unhappy with it looking a little frumpy and being so loose under the arms all my bras showed . i took it back to the store and after reading the reviews here decided to try the smaller sizes...well multiple dresses later i ended up buying a size 2 petite!!! and i'm 5'9"". the 2 reg and petite still had the loose gathering look to the top but both fit much better under the arms so tha"
1,"Love I never ever buy anything full price when it comes to retailer shopping, love their stuff but way over priced so i patiently watch and wait. this dress though i couldn't do it, i had to have it. i think it is a fabulous addition to my summer collection and i look forward to wearing it in a few weeks to a july 4th get away. get it while you can."
1,"Pretty dress, runs large I just received this dress in the mail today. i ordered an xs and it was huge! there is no way that i could wear a bra without it showing due to the size of the arm holes. i'm 5'2"" and 117 lbs with an athletic build for reference. i love free flowing dresses, but this was over the top. i ordered the plaid version in an xs petite and that fit much truer to size. i reordered this in an xs petite to see if that will work better. the dress itself is lovely. the green color is vibrant and the embroid"
0,"Fit is unflattering I wish i had read more of the reviews....but thought i would give it a try. the shirt doesn't seem as long as on the model but the armpits are sewn to hit mid shirt. this would be ok if it was the length pictured, but since it isn't it makes you look very boxy. i don't know if i ordered a size too big or if it is just the way the shirt was made. wanted to love for fall.....unfortunately, i am taking back."
0,"Alas, the pockets! Beautiful fabric and beautifully made, but the pockets ruin it... and i love pockets. you cannot see from the photos, but they protrude from the sides a few inches beyond the skirt, and look strange and unflattering, especially from the back. they are unfortunately placed right below the hips, and the effect is like those french bicycle baskets, ""panniers."" if they were smaller and in the front, the dress would work. i am usually a size 4 and both the 2 and the 4 fit me well ? not too snug or to"
1," This dress is adorable, but fit a bit large through the waist. i ordered the 6 and am exchanging for the 4, so hopefully it will work better for me. for reference, i am 5'7, 135 lbs curvy. the fabric is soft and swingy and the striped under-layer is feminine and adorable. love."

and it can be worn casualties or formally."
0,"Wanted to love this but couldn't I saw this dress online and really wanted to love it... unfortunately it wasn't at all as expected in person.

as the previous reviewer mentioned it is extremely itchy material, which was already pilling on many of the dresses displayed in the store. the neck was extremely tight; a problem i've never encountered with any retailer dress. additionally it seems to have a kangaroo pocket located right underneath the bust line, which protruded in an unflattering way. the pocket is not at all not"
0,"Pretty print but didn't work. Wanted to like this type. cute print. something about the width and length of this top didn't work on me. was a little boxy. i'm 5'4, 135lbs, size xs-s. might be cuter on different body type, i'm hourglass and athletic."
1,"Great summer dress I saw this dress on sale online and it was available at my local retailer. i tried it on and went with the xs, i'm 5'4 130lbs, 34c and it fit great with some room. tts the material is fabulous and it comes with a matching green slip which is great."
1,"Great dress! Beautiful color, great quality! on sale too. a must have!"
1,"New favorite lbd Love this dress. in fact, i loved it enough to get it altered so it would fit. purchased the black dress in a size 6, but the top was too big. and i'm not small chested, i am a 32d! i had to get the seam under my underarms taken in for the top of the dress to fit properly. but, now that it is altered...i love it."
1,"Love! This blouse is beautiful and true to size. i was so happy it fit after ordering it online. i'm a bit busty and broad but generally wear a m in most retailer tops and the m fit perfectly. length was perfect on me...not too long and not short. i'm 5'1"" for reference. definitely a top that can be worn dressed up with slacks and heels or skinny jeans and flats. love it!"
1,"Looks just as good in person! I love the lacy details on the skirt. this dress is perfectly simple, yet can be dressed up too. as the evenings get cooler, it pairs up nicely with a cropped denim jacket or a cardigan."
0,Pretty but flawed I was so excited to get this dress...i even paid expedited shipping! i read the reviews and thought that i ordered properly but i sadly disappointed. it was just too big. i'm a size 6-8 petite and the size 8 was overwhelming. the side of the dress were down to my stomach and i just can't wear the dress. not sure what to do but buyers be careful. pretty color and design but not well-designed.
1," I ordered my usual size 8 but this run huge, i had to exchange for 6 or even size 4. the fabric is nice and airy. it seems to easily wrinkle though. just have to either iron everytime or dry clean i suppose. unique design."
1,Great dress This dress fits incredibly well. i loved the color and it will transition through the fall nicely.
1,Fall essential! I ordered xs/s. i usually wear medium in tops and coats. the next size up would've been too big so this cape does run large.
0,"Great, but... Loved the dress. loved the pattern and the cut. unfortunately it did not work for me. it is cut too low under the arm pits and therefore, showed too much breast. it is not made to wear a bra with either so that is not a solution. sticky boobs will not work either because it is the ""side breast"" that shows. i hated to have to send back but.....still looking for something similar and great!"
0,"Heavy fabric I ordered this dress, expecting a cool lightweight summer dress. i believe it says cotton in the description.however the material is a very heavy cotton-linen blend.would have much preferred a better quality fabric.the color is a nice green and is well made.it runs large, except in the bust which fit well."
1,Bright and beautiful I didn't notice this online but it caught my eye in the store. the colors are bright and beautiful. i wear a 10/12 or m/l. i tried the 12 but the bust was too big (i wear a 36c). i ordered the size 10 and it fits perfect. i'm so glad i saw it in the store. i think it makes much more of an impact in person than online.
1,"Sweet I have the pink plaid pippa and this mint one is nothing like it, but in a good way.  shorter, sweet embroidery but the same swing silhouette and drop waist style.  this dress is a little oversized so if you want more fitted look, you can size down.  stay tts if your busty like me.  imo, the mint looks more sky blue than green.  i got the medium regular and i'm 5'3"" 140# 36dd and ends at my knees."
1,"Cool ohio Just got this dress and am very pleased.  fell in love with the bright color in the store and then came home ordered it at a great sale price!!  color is as shown...beautiful lace trim at the bottom.....back longer than front as described and pockets!!  i am 5'2"" and length on a large comes to just below the knees..in front....i may wear leggings under it...dont like the slip as it is far too tight...will wear a tee or turtle under it..  quality heavier fabric. roomy... linen and cotton."
1,"Simple closet staple This dress is so simple, but gorgeous on. the top runs a bit small in the shoulders/bust. the top button gapes a bit in the bust area. the cuffs and collar insides are a different coordinating print and provides a cute option to roll or unbutton and press open to style."
1,"Great every day, just needs a tuck... Ok, the material is great, light & airy. the thing they don't show you is the waist line is tucked in the photo, that's why you cant see the bi level hem line. the hem line is fantastic. the waist is the problem, the whole dress just hangs huge from bust down. the material is so light i would caution against darting the dress. i created a button loop cinch under the outside corer of the pockets, on the seem of the waist. this worked for me."
1,"This is a keeper I just got this dress in the mail, and i have to disagree with the previous reviewer.. the embroidery on the dress is so well done and thick. the material is high quality and although breathable, holds up perfectly to the embroidery.. i usually order an extra small in loose fitting dresses, and ordered the extra small in this one. i'm 5'4"", 117 pounds, with a curvy build. the xs was more fitted, which i wanted. i can belt it or wear it loose. did i mention the color? vibrant rich green. can't wa"
1," I love the color, which is eye popping without being gaudy. i am 142lbs, 5' 4"" and got size 4. it goes beautifully on my slightly brown skin. the length is just above the knee and the fold of the dress in the front adds that extra touch of oomph. it does have wide arm holes so a bra, even a strapless one, could be tricky, although it wasn't a gaping hole for me. i think i could wear it over a green bikini-like halter bra and take care of the arm issue."
0,Cut is off It seems this coat could have been manufactured under a smaller spec size because the size large looses shape and where it hits on the waistline is unflattering. quality is high however
1,"Great summer, country dress I loved this dress when i saw it mostly for its emerald color. i am tan with brown hair and features so green is a good color for me. the quality is very high with detailed embroidery and thick fabric. the dress comes with a slip which fits well but i don't think you'd have to wear based on the opaqueness of the fabric. the dress fits true to size but the cut is gracious through the hips. this is a relaxed fitting. drop waist dress."
1,"Pretty, but not good enough for full price I thought this dress was lovely on. i'm an 8/10 and tried the med which i believe was the right fit. it may have fit a little large but i liked the way it hung. it has pockets and the color is absolutely beautiful. definitely buying if it makes it to sale."
1,"Fabulous, petites rejoice I ordered xs petite. which they are sold out of. but in case you are a different size i wanted to write a review. i'm 5 feet tall and 120 lbs. i am 34  d so busty. the petite did not overwhelm me. the pockets do open. you're supposed to cut the little threads out. ask a dry cleaner or an retailer stylist for help. i like that there is a little ""stiffness"" to the cape. it has holes for your arms. not a poncho. your lucky if they have your size!"
1, I love this dress. i wish i had ordered a size bigger because now its out of stock. if you are between sizes order a size up. i'm in between a 4 and a 6 petite and ordered the size 4 and the dress is too tight in the bust. the dress has no give so it has to fit perfect. it is so lovely i don't want to return it. i will try to find a seamstress to help with the fit. my favorite part of the dress are the side pockets. they're big and adorable.
1," Great sweater. long and warm, but not too thick. i am 5'4"" and ordered a medium. fits and hangs nicely."
1," Beautiful in person! highly recommend: great quality, beautiful design, flattering!"
1," Gorgeous shirt! the detail on this shirt is impeccable! even with its boxy shape, it was very flattering on my petite, curvy frame. i'd say this shirt runs just a tad big. i'm 5' 118lbs and the xs fit perfectly."
1,Great top I bought this late in the season and love the way it fits and looks.
1,"Must have denim Perfect denim top! the fabric/material is great and of good quality. there is a structure to the top, but it really makes the looks. the quality is amazing and the top can be styled in so many ways. for the quality, a definite must buy!"
1,"Nice basic - for layering I know it's for warm weather, but i am more excited to use as a layering piece for fall/ winter. i bought 2 sizes a 4 & 6, because i wasn't sure on size. the 6 was way big on me, but the boxy cut of the 4 left enough room for a shirt or light sweater underneath."
1,Very versatile I love how feminine and interesting this top is. what i especially like is that you can layer different colored camis underneath to get a completely different look. the weight of the material makes it appropriate for all seasons. it is very well made and is something you can wear to work and also wear if you are going out afterward.
0,Almost So much right but then....too short.
1,"Fantastic tank! I ordered this because i can&#39;t resist denim shirts.  i love the unusual shape for a tank top and the full-length, bronze zipper in the back is to die for.  it looks great with everything!"
1,"Gorgeous This skirt is gorgeous. i love the dots, the heavy fabric, the slight metallic in the weave. it also has two exposed zippers, one on either side of the waist, which gives it an edgy vibe. a perfect counter balance to the 50s circle skirt cuteness. however, not knowing my size in tracy reese, i ordered my usual retailer size 4. i cannot even zip it. i measured it and the size 4 has a 24 inch waist. there is about an inch of give in the band, but the elastic is so heavy it would not be flattering to"
1,"Lovely drape in your regular size I originally purchased this in my usual retailer size 6 (vanity size lol), and was nervous that the neck would be tight, based on the other reviews. however, once i tried it on i realized that in my usual size the body was a little too wide and didn't create any shape. i ended up exchanging for and keeping a size 4 and it fits much better in the body and i did not have a problem with any tightness in the neck in either size. for reference i'm 5'7"", 36dd 135lbs.

i would say this items runs true"
1,"Flattering denim I love the look of this top. my original order was returned because of a defect but the customer service was wonderful. they took it back at the store and sent out another one right away.
the style is very flattering and the quality of the denim is excellent.
love the back zipper as well."
1,"Love fox head print This skirt is really pretty in person. my store had jsut gotten it in when i was in the dressing room and my stylist askedher coworker to bring it for me to try on. i tried on the regular 0 (my sotre dones't carry petite :-( # and it was perfect, length was actually nice. i can't compare to petite, maybe i will order it jsut to see. #i am 115 lbs, 5'1.5"")

two things to consider: first, the image online ahs a balck lining at the hem of the skirt. nonte of the skirts in sotre ahd that, the hem"
1,"Stiff and sturdy I am not quite sure what to think about this top... color is nice, cut iis pretty but the material is denim denim....it would probably soften with wear but the deal breaker for me is that i have a vein in my neck that pops out like crazy when i wear the top. if i release the neck it goes back to normal. not that it is tight but apparently it blocks flow somehow. so i passed. 

i tried on regulat 0 and it was fine at 115 lbs. 30 dd chest"
0,"Great concept, but snags easily! This top is adorable in style and fit. which is why it breaks my heart that i can't recommend it. the embroidery snags so easily, when i wore it, i ended up with several tears in the threads, leaving the pattern a bit of a mess. it snagged on my rings, my watch and my purse. i returned it because of this. it's really too bad, and i wish the design were printed on instead of sewn, simply because it would last a lot longer."
1,"Beautiful halter to show off shoulders! I found this top in my local store. there were two colors available, this coral color and a deep teal color. i purchased the teal in a m, which is one size down from my normal size. it drapes beautifully. it is a tunic length, but not too long. i love the way it makes my shoulders look. i have athletic shoulders, and halter styles are best in the summer for me. this tank will require a strapless bra, i plan to wear a bandeau but i am not very big up top. anyhow, love this top. if it gets release"
1,"Great top to span the seasons I think the orange top will look great in the fall as well as spring. i'm 5' 7.5"" and it's a great tunic length on me. it's really pretty and i love it. snap it up on sale!"
1,Versatile top I love this top. i purchased it in an xs and feels it is tts. it can be dressed up or down. i recently paired this with the cloth and stone chambray drawstring shorts and it was the perfect summer outfit. the button details in the back are such a nice touch. i got many compliments on this top.
1,"Stunning blouse This blouse is gorgeous. first of all, it's cotton! so, it is extremely comfortable. it isn't tighter in some areas more than others, but fits evenly throughout, which although a rarity, is wonderful. finally, a blouse that fits perfectly! i am 5'3"" and 108 pounds. i ordered the regular xs and it hits right at my hips. i have a longer torso, however, so although i am not tall, the petite would have been too short for me. it is beautifully made and the red is a beautiful crimson on white. grab th"
1,"Stunning light, airy top! This piece is just gorgeous. you will almost never catch me paying full price for a clothing item, but today i did! i've been admiring it online, and when i noticed it had sold out (the red version) online, i stopped by a store to see if they had it in stock. well, it looks even more gorgeous in person, and i snapped it up right away. i envision myself wearing this all summer long and beyond."
0,"Back pleats are never a good idea This shirt is gorgeous at first glance. the quality is there and it has a beautiful design...from the front, that is. but it is huge and billowy with back pleats. i cannot imagine this being flattering on anyone. it just adds so much volume to the top. i am thin and petite so maybe that was the issue, but i just can't see adding so much volume. this was a total miss for me. such a shame. would have been great without all the extra volume in back."
1," Normally i like to purchase from the store so i can try things on first, but this top wasn't available locally. i guessed on a medium. i'm 5'5"" and very curvy and the medium fits just like the picture on the model. just a hint of a sleeve and nice and drapey-loose over the body. the embroidery is just beautiful. the only reason i'm not giving 5 stars for quality is that i had to sew two buttons onto the back, my top came without them."
1,"Really cute but didn't work I bought this thinking it would be a great summer tunic, but it was really huge on me. i normally wear a medium but ordered down a size and it was still quite large. it was very long as well and i am 6' tall. i am normally a size 8, to give you an idea. i would recommend it, but it is going back for me."
1,"Worth a look I noticed this top on the sale rack and loved the color palette. it would be a nice top through spring, summer and into fall. the colors in it will go with lots of things in most wardrobes. the cut and style of the top are flattering and it feels good on my skin. i can see wearing a shawl with it is cooler weather or perhaps a cropped sweater. the cap at the top of the sleeve is cute, although i wish it extended just a bit longer. i tried a xs and an s. probably could have purchased the xs, but"
1,"Lovely if you don't have curves! The lace detail on this blouse is beautiful. i love that it is cotton and it has a detachable camisole which is a nice touch. unfortunately, this didn't work for me as i found it extremely unflattering. the gathered material just doesn't work if you have a large bust. it made me look enormous, which is never a good feeling. i recommend, but only for tall, slim types with a small bust."
1,"Loved this blouse, just not on me I so wanted this blouse to work. the lacework is beautiful, and it is a substantial and well made top. the neck fits well, which is not a given for this style top, and i really like the 3/4 length sleeves. but the top billows out like a tent on me in all directions, and it was an awkward length on me (not quite hip length, not quite tunic). wish this were cut a little straighter and longer. i'm 5'4"", 120 lbs and tried a size s."
1,Very cute! This skirt is so cute. the fix print is really nice. it's a great piece to add to the fall wardrobe.
1,"Love! I love how unique this top is, especially the buttons that run on the back.
it is cut boxy, but i think it works because there is so much other detail going on. the fabric is comfortable, and the stitching on the inside is not irritating."
1,Unique and perfect Such great detail great beautiful in red and white.
1,"Love, love, love This top is so cute and so comfy. i love the details, especially in the back. this embodies what i love about retailer clothing- the little unique touches that you find anywhere else. very pleased."
0,"Disappointed I initially saw this top a few months ago, and fell in love. it ended up selling out in stores, so i ordered it online, where it was back-ordered by a couple of months. i received it this past week, and was sadly disappointed. the design is pretty, but overall the quality is sorely lacking. i wonder if maybe the first batch was good, but when they realized they were so popular, and had more made, the newer batches weren't as good? not sure. the one i got had inconsistent red embroidery, and ther"
1,"Recommend but with a caveat... I tried the 4 and felt it ran a bit big, i'm 34a-28-26, 5'6"" about 130lbs and expected to take a 6. the 4 was ideal.
love the concept but thought the material was too stiff to be a 'swing' tank. the pleats in the back poke up when you move or bend as if you've got little horns coming out of your back. i think a chambray, like cloth and stone produces might have rendered this super cute design better (imo).
it has a trapeze shape, i wouldn't plan on tucking it in.
finally, you mightn't want to"
0,This top is way to long. Hate i have to return it - way too long-almost more mid thigh/almost dress length.
1," Cute top. a little delicate. my top arrived with a rip in the sleeve. fortunately, my tailor was able to fix it."
1," Luckily i found this in the store though it is on backorder online, so if you really want it - go to/call the store. it's effortless, fun, beautiful, and nicely detailed. love this top. i'm 5'5"" and usually wear size 6, and i bought a small. really worth the price b/c you can just throw it on and look fabulous. layers well. so happy i got this."
1,Pretty top Very pretty. love the design both front and back
1,"This one is a winner! This is a beautiful top, the pattern reminds me very much of mola designs stitched in panama. i love the contrast of the red stitching against the white background. i'm not as crazy about the buttons on the back sides- not sure what that detail adds to the piece. it is a boxy shape, so be aware it's not going to hug the figure. the cotton is soft and medium weight. overall, it's a stand-out!"
1,"Can't wait for summer!! Absolutely in love with this top. the embroidery and back button detail make for a unique and fun look. light and airy material will be perfect in warmer weather with a cute pair of shorts. i got a size small and it fits perfectly. measurements: 5'4, 135lbs, 32e"
1,"Boxy but pretty Bought this in xs petite - i'm 5'2"", 102, it was too big, so took it to a tailor. altered it so that horizontal stitching at the bottom sits gently on my hips, rather than floating way out all around. it's now nice and flattering; i get tons of compliments. note that the fabric is more off white, than bright white; i bought it online thinking it would look good with white jeans - it actually looks best with blue jeans or navy shorts/pants. drapes nicely and doesn't wrinkle. a win!"
1, Most often complimented item of this spring's wardrobe
1,"Runs a bit large I wound up returning this shirt, because i ordered the wrong size! so sad. i should have sized down. i'm tall, and long waisted, but slight on top. 

the shirt is gorgeous, and the detailing is perfectly done. i'd definitely recommend trying this one. just choose your size carefully.."
1,"Love! This shirt feels so special. it is mainly t shirt material so i will be dry cleaning to make sure it keeps
it's shape and delicate feel. the stitching is so beautiful! i'll wear this with jeans and even my navy pencil skirt for work. so cute!"
1, It's a cute top. i agree with the other poster that the neck in the front feels a little restrictive.
1,"Gorgeous top! perfect for summer! Absolutely love this top! i've been on the lookout for a cute cotton top, something that'd be ideal for summertime. this beautiful piece doesn't disappoint. the color pairing - white cotton base and lovely red thread embroidery - looks stunning. not the mention the unique back detailing makes it a must-have. highly recommend."
1," This has lovely embroidery of good quality, and it is nicely lined in the embroidered section too. it is a very loose swingy shape, so size down."
1,"Beautiful, flattering, comfortable I love this dress. it's beautiful and flattering. not to mention that it is also comfortable with a bit of stretch. i couldn't see it in the picture, but the black parts on the shoulders in front and on the back is sheer, so you have to be careful with underwear choice. i have an apple shape and yet this was flattering and the perfect length. i am short and apple-shaped and it was a great choice."
1,"Front black mesh at top pokes out at sides I agree the light colored portion of dress is not vanilla; it is more beige color. i liked the dress a lot, it had a flattering fit on me, extremely comfortable and then i noticed the black mesh portion at top of dress. it did not lay flat at the outer sides between the mesh and floral fabrics like the picture. it poked out on both sides at least 1"" which suddenly made the dress look cheap and ill fitting. i can guess either the mesh pattern piece was not cut correctly or it was not sewn correct"
1,"My favorite jeans These are my favorite jeans. the fabric is soft but has a good amount of weight to them. all the details reflect a high quality jean. i usually have a very hard time finding jeans that fit my backside and thighs well without a huge gap at the waist. these sit lower on my hips, no gap, and plenty of space for my butt. they do run a bit large though. i have a 29"" natural waist and think a 28 would have been even more perfect."
1,"Beautiful blouse; not good for full figures I purchased this blouse in my usual size xl. the wine color is very nice, sort of a rusty cranberry. i so badly wanted to love this blouse but i have to return it. there is so much fabric in the back that it makes me look like a giant cranberry. it is not flattering at all on my full figure. maybe if i was very slender, the massive volume of fabric wouldn't matter but sadly it needs to go back. on a side note, this is a cotton blouse and i believe it is going to require ironing since i badly wri"
1,"Summer chambray! I love this top!! i got lucky and found it returned at a store (always always check the ""found and collected racks ladies!) it was a 6 and i was a little worried it would be much to large, but it fit great! i like that i can wear something under it or on its own. i didn't fit it too short, but i'm a little under 5'7"" and roughly 127 lbs, 32/34a. highly recommend!"
1,"High waist and seemed to run small on me Cute skirt and print, but high waisted. also was more snug so think it runs a tad small. i wanted to tuck in a shirt like shown in picture, but it looks goofy because the waist is so high. also there is no flexibility there so size up if you want to wear it lower. the model's arms are covering her waist so hard to tell what proportion looks like on her. i'm 5'4 so might work better on a taller person. sending back."
1,"Odd fit Based on previous reviews, i sized up to size 4 - i typically wear xs or s. while the length was okay, the body was way too wide! the neck was almost like a mock neck & higher than i expected which made it very uncomfortable for me! overall, i didn't find it flattering or anything special."
0,"Pretty, didn't work for me The embroidery on this was beautiful but didn't hang well on my athletic/small chested upper body."
1,Perfect fit Fits great and super flattering
1,Simple but beautiful This shirt is really cute.  i love the color and design.  i like wearing it with jeans and sneakers.
1,"Foxy print The fox print is super cute and the reason i ordered the skirt.  sizing was true to me, i'm usually an 8 and the 8 fit fine.  the waist is high and if you try to wear it low the side zipper puckers  out in a weird way.  skirt length is above knee (i'm 5' 6"").  skirt is lined but the lining is dark brown/black same as the waist band in the photo of the model wearing it.  the lining does not show at the hem, it's concealed.  overall a fun a-line swingy skirt for late summer that will go into fall"
1," Loved this from the minute i saw it! great quality, very heavy denim, which i like. does run small. went up a size to be safe. happy with the purchase!"
1,"Gorgeous and unique! Gorgeous color, flowy fabric, unique design - this top is a winner. i don't even mind that i'll have to wear a strapless bra with it! a little bit on the larger size, but not too big in my opinion."
1,"Order this before it sells out again! Love this! saw online, didn't place the order and when i came back it was gone. retailer restocked so i got it second time around. ordered the red option. this shirt is beautiful! sometimes the online photos don't do the piece justice, but this time, it's even better in person. the embroidered detail is gorgeous, the fabric is light weight, and the back of the shirt has button down panels that are almost linen-like in look and feel. the fit is just as pictured imo. bringing this on vacation with m"
1," I recently bought this blouse, the soft fabric drapes nicely and the stitching is wonderful. love it!"
1,"Great quality, high neck A wonderfully heavy weight piece, opposed to all the swingy chambray of summer, this piece will transition wonderfully into fall. the only disadvantage is a relatively high neck, which looks lovely but can be a little restrictive at times. highly recommend!"
1,"Perfect Gorgeous embroidery, soft fabric, great drape, hides tummy--overall perfect.  size down.  i bought the small and i am 36dd."
1,Perfect fit! Love the fit and color of this top. i love that it is somewhat fitted around the arm holes which doesn't allow for extra skin to show. it drapes nicely over my hips and tummy. got rave reviews from my husband!!
1," This is such a unique and beautiful top. it will be a go-to in my closet all year round. the red embroidery is amazing. meant to be a loose fit. i'm 5'7"" and 120 lbs and ordered the xs. fits perfectly."
1," Beautiful,lightweight and well tailored 
more dressy than what it appears in photo"
1,"Excellent dress Form fitting, hugs in the right spots, and love the pattern. it's a little shorter than i expected and too formal to wear to work. however, an excellent evening dress."
1, Love these jeans!!! they are the perfect fit from waist to ankles. their first wear was like i'd been wearing them for years. i paired them with the pintuck button-down tunic.
1,"A really cute top I am normally an xs or s in tanks, so ordered the size 6. looks pretty much on me as in the pic. love that it's a cotton denim but it doesn't have any stretch. love the look & the fabric, but the neck area feels slightly restrictive in the front & i think it wld creep up & pull on me when wearing. fabric is slightly stiff & the flared bottom just sticks out. armholes do cover the bra & length hits at the top of the hips on me. going to return the 6, but will try the 8 if the local store has it."
1,"Glad to find a swimsuit with full coverage Really gorgeous print! i purchased these to go with the top (also recommend it as well) and i love these! i have a larger behind, and it's nowadays it seems to find swimsuits with full coverage without feeling like a diaper - these are it. there is elastic at the leg openings, so that may be uncomfortable for some, but i found no problem with it. for reference, i am usually a 6/8 28/29 in pants, and i purchased a medium."
1,"Super soft It might look a bit stiff from the photo, but this fabric is so soft and really is a fashionable sweatshirt!"
1,"Seriously, the perfect summer top! This blouse is perfect in so many ways: it's cotton, the fit is super flattering, the design is gorgeous. i never, and i mean never, wear red, but i made an exception here due to the exceptionally stunning embroidery. i know this will be comfortable this summer; the fit is slightly loose, so the air can flow. the cotton is light but not thin, no cami needed. a medium size fits me very well; i am size 8/medium top, 34f, 130#. i love that the armholes are high and hide any flaws. the button design"
1,Love this! This is a unique take on a denim shirt! i have about five other denim shirts but love this style.
1," This is such a lovely top, but so very big and billowy. makes me wish i were taller, then i think it could work. there is just too much extra fabric all around. so sad because it seems well made, and is very beautiful. too bad it doesn't come in petites or even an xxs. even with my hips, it was just too much."
1,"Cute top, comfy,  great going in to fall. Love this top, runs true to size. looks cute with in style army green cargo pants.  great buy at sale price."
1,"Unique front and back The back of this top is very unique and the embroidery looked like it would hold up.
it does have a boxy shape, but it really works with this piece. i found it to run true to size compared to other pieces i have from retailer. for some reference, i'm 5'5"" and weigh 148lbs."
1,Wow! so unique What a cute shirt! i got the red and white and it's definitely a summer shirt although i'm sure you could make it look cute under a cardigan. i'm a 10 m and the m fit well. tts.
1," I love this top! usually i prefer neutral colors, but i looked at every one of the colors, and fell in love with the pink. i think it looks the best with the embroidery at the top. i too love this cut on my shoulders for summer. i would definitely recommend this top. i bought an xs and it's perfect. this shirt made me feel like twirling, i love it."
1,"Sooo soft!! Soft and stylish - my usual large seems a bit too large, so i will try a medium."
0,"Underwhelmed Was really excited for this dress but should have paid more attention to the material it was made with. for the price of the dress, it felt very cheap. i didn't even end up trying it on after i opened the packaging. the colors were not as vibrant as the picture. as another reviewer mentioned, it was more similar to something you would purchase off a boardwalk. very disappointed and will be returning."
1,"Soooooo soft! These pants are amazingly soft and comfortable. they can be worn with cute flats and a dressier top/accessories to work or with a simple tee or tank with tennies for running errands or lounging around. these are great for multiple seasons. i'm 5'2 so they are a little long but the ruched ankle makes that look by ""by design""."
1,"Beautiful design This is a really great bathing suit top. i haven't purchased a bikini in about 4 years so i'm glad this is the one i finally purchased. the floral pattern is dainty and gorgeous. the fabric itself is soft and comfortable. i listed it as a 'true to size' fit, but if you're on the larger end of your size spectrum i would get the size up for better coverage. i'm a size 8 through and through, and so ordered a m per their size standards. the size m was comfortable and fit but the size l covered bette"
1,Love style Really nice green blend of colors. fun style but not especially figure flattering as it is a very wide peplum. i still love it and goes with many outfits and as a fall jacket. is a bit itchy. need to wear sleeved top or dress underneath.
1,"Very pretty Love the shirt. exteemely comfortable, simple and nice."
1,Love these! My new favorite piece of loungewear. super cute and comfortable.
1,"Soft but These are extremely soft but do run about one size too big with one exception; the opening to pull your feet through that bag nicely around your ankles is soooooo small that you have to work to pull the heel of your foot out. for me, these are dual duty pants; casual wear like to the grocery store or coffee shop trip and second as great soft pj bottoms. though the ankles are small, they do not feel tight at all because the fabric is really that soft. they work well with both my sneakers and clas"
1,"The coolest pants When i tried them on, i didn't want to take them off! they are so soft, so stylish, they drape your body just the right way, they are stretchy, so even though i am wearing 30 in jeans, i took s regular! run hone and tried it on with moss cowled side-zip tunic, 2 different booties and aquaflora reversible vest, all variations and combos looked really cool and great! i even tried with high heeled booties and dressier sweater top (warm-up pullover in charcoal), looked like high couture! the color i"
1,"So soft and figure-flattering I ordered the black 2 months ago, it was on back order, and i jsut received it finally. the fabric is super soft, itried on both xxs and xs and could keeo either one. the ""v"" in front where it crosses is low, so most people do need a cami underneath, but you could probably do without for ultra sexy look (not my style, but could be done). i plan on wearing this with skirts, deresses and slacks... i saw a commet on the lighter color, not sure, but love this one in black for sure@"
1,"Wonderful wrap cardigan I've been looking for a wrap cardigan for a while and this totally fit the bill. it fits well, is soft, and made of good materials. i love the versatility of using it with all my dresses. this is a great staple piece."
1,"Bohemian chic I loved this dress in the photos and couldn't wait to try it on in person. the print varies from dress to dress and mine had noticeably much more cream color in it. i didn't mind too much but it didn't look like the dress the model is wearing. i bought the xxs petite which fit true to size. the v neck is a bit low for petite sizing but the length was perfect on my 5'2"" frame which was a plus. i agree with the other reviewers the fabric is cheap and feels cheap. not something i would expect from"
1,Lovely dress I love this dress! it is equally pretty in person too. sometimes i will order things and when i get them the colors are totally different than what i anticipated. not with this dress. i love it and will get a lot of use out of it over the spring/summer.
0,"More blue than grey and way too big Sometimes i order things online that i can hardly wait to arrive, and then once they do, i wonder if i made a mistake when ordering it. this is one of those times, and it was not my mistake. the shirt i received is not like this one. it is an xs, but it is quite large falling inches below where this one hits on the model. everyone i have shown the shirt to says that it is a denim blue color, not grey at all. it is a pretty color, but not what i thought i was ordering. i hate it when this happens"
1,"Love but fabric easily pulled Love the fit and style of this maxi. have gotten many compliments! however, my toddler grabbed the dress when she was falling over and it pulled a bunch of threads out and made the fabric look puckered and worn in that spot!!! for a toddler to do that makes me feel like the quality isn't amazing. also, the waist part itches me."
0,"Grey not color as pictured on website I wanted to love this top, but when i received the picture on the website is a dark charcoal almost black and the ""grey"" that you order is much, much lighter grey. in addition, this shirt is super boxy... thus why the model probably is pinning her elbows to her side to bring the top in. going back disappointed."
1,"Easy and stylish This dress is so pretty; can be worn casually or with heels to dress up! i get so many compliments on it, and it's so comfortable, it's like wearing pajamas! i highly reccomend it."
0,"Horribly scratchy And the bottom looks like a tutu. first, i have high tolerance for scratchy fabric but this one i could feel it even through long sleeves. there is no way i could wear something that makes my skin itch so badly. second, the peplum part is huge and looks like an exaggerated skirt. finally, the color on the ""green one"" is darker than in the picture and it does have more of a green than blue tint. back it goes."
0,Scratchy Cute but too thick and rough
1,"Silky drape, super pretty design This is a lovely dress with a soft fabric that drapes over the body. the pattern is soft and feminine, very much like the picture. my only issue, which is why i didn't give it 5 stars for my overall rating, is it's a bit snug around the bodice. this could be because i'm a lifelong swimmer however, my bra size is 34 b or c depending, so this shouldn't be an issue for this dress.

other stats: 5'7"" 117 lbs and i got this in an extra small per recommendations of other reviewers. the small would b"
0,"Nice dress, but cheaply made Given the price, i was pretty disappointed by the quality of the fabric. the dress falls nicely and fits well, but the fabric is cheap... i have another maxi dress that i bought for like 20 bucks at store on the boardwalk and it has the same fit and fabric. 
 
i expect a lot more from a dress with this price. i'd recommend only buying on super-sale."
1,"Gorgeous print I was thinking this was another maeve winner but this is actually plenty by tracy reese dress. i love the flowy fabric, the soft but vibrant colors and the gorgeous print. i wanted a size mp but that sold out so i purchased a regular m (with the intention to hem) and i find it too large in the bust. i'm going to order the sp instead too see if that fits better. for reference i am 5'3"" 36dd 140#."
1,"Simply lovely and so cozy! Knitted and knotted makes such gorgeous sweaters:  this is bathed in lovely, almost impresssionistic color, and the deep ruffle at the bottom is feminine and flattering.  i adored the way there's enough wrap-around to get cozy in it, as i wore it through my day.  i went with the green in a regular medium, which is my normal size:  size 8, 34f.  the 27% mohair enhances the soft feeling and lush look.  as i wore this piece today, i felt that i was wearing something very special."
1,"This dress is everything I can't get enough of this dress! this dress is everything. from the flattering fit, to the colors and pattern, to the design, and to the quality.. this dress really has it all. this is worth every penny and in my opinion, a great price for a versatile, high quality dress. the material is that super comfy, stretchy material which is perfect for everyday! it is a no brainer and easy to throw on. i'm so happy it comes in petite as the xsp length fits me perfect! it hits at the perfect length for a"
0,"Not what i expected at all I probably should have gone with petite. this dress was just awful on. the waist was nowhere near where it was supposed to be. it hits me about thigh level. it's very unforgiving, clingy, and shows every bump. i found the material tolerable but if worn for long periods of time, i have a suspicion that it would begin to irritate my skin and be scratchy. it's going back."
0,"Absolutely perfect If you are going for a ridiculously high priced ugly sweater contest, this is the one for you. i normally like clothing with some character and juxtaposition, but this one did not do it for me. i cannot imagine the collar fitting right or flattering anyone, and the mixed layers end up making it look cheap rather than trendy."
0,"So pretty but... I love this sweater so much and wanted it to be my new favorite, but unfortunately it was a bit short for my longer torso. when i raised my arms up, it bunched up all wrong because it's a very thick sweater."
1,Fairisle sweater color This sweater is gorgeous in print but in person the colors are murkier. the yellow dots are really a dusty mustard yellow and the navy is a smokey navy. the white background reads more oatmeal in person.
1,"Gorgeous fair isle beauty This sweater is stunning. it is extremely well made. tons of tiny little embellishments that get noticed even by the most discerning eye! i've received so many compliments on it. if you want it to fit generously or with extra roominess, i recommend ordering one size up. it fits true to size."
1,"Would have loved in summer I had this in my wish list a long time, ten when sale came along, my size was sold out. however, someone returned it at my local store. i purchased it then tried it on later... why i ended returning it:

fabric was gorgeous, and light, but fall is coming, and i won't wear it until next summer. may get over it by then
the shape is really nice, but the hem hit me in a weird spot on my short muscular legs
as others mentioned, there are spots where the sewing is not ""perfect"" and bulges a little"
0," I also returned this dress after waiting weeks to received it.  i had high hopes for this dress as i really loved it online but what a disappointment when i got it.  the fabric is made of cheap poly that's shiny, thin, and clingy.  it shows every lump and bump you have.  the zipper at the back won't lay flat and keeps bunching up creating an ugly bump.  the sewing and hemline is uneven.  there wasn't a lot of thought put in in the print placement where the seams was sewn together in the midline"
1,"Bright, classic, and all around lovely These culottes are beautiful! really pretty cerise shade with a nice eyelet pattern. they are only partially lined. the size small, my normal size, was falling off of me so i sized down to extra small which fit perfectly."
1,Super comfy I've read the previous reviews about this dress and was hesitant to order it but i'm so happy i did! i can definitely understand why certain reviews are saying that the fabric is cheap. it is an extremely thin material as well as a thin lining.  however i think it depends on the person. because neither of those things actually bother me. i get hot very easily so i appreciate the fact that this dress is very thin and flowy.  i think it's extremely comfortable and looks very cute on.  the zipper d
1," The top is indeed a bit boxier than i was expecting, as the other reviewer found. it still looks good tucked in if you're concerned about it. the fact that it's sustainably produced in ghana was a big part of my desire to keep it too. really great to see designers producing clothing responsibly! i wish that how a garment is manufactured is highlighted more on this site because it definitely contributes to my purchases."
1,"Cozy fairisle with visual interest The texture, mixed yarn, and beading make for a lovely variation on the fairisle. as other reviewers have said, the length is not as long as it appears in the picture. the color is a very dark navy, almost black. the neck opening is larger than a standard crew sweater but lays mostly flat. the overall look is boxy. i'm 5'7 and normally wear a medium in retailer sweaters. i changed to a large so it would be longer and have a roomy drapy feel."
1,"Great vest Perfection.  fits like other pilcto jackets and vests.  tapers in slightly at waist for flattering fit   weight is light for summer but substantial and good quality.  silver buttons, not bronze or copper.  slight stretch, super comfy.  no regret!"
0,"Shapeless I really wanted to like this because the color is beautiful and the knit is obviously good quality. but the shape is impossible to work with. it doesn't just run big, it just hangs there. really disappointing. it'll have to go back."
0,"Complete mess I love eva franco 
this is a very poor version ! bias seams are puckery... zipper is bubbled 
felt great looked like fun but too much if a mess to be fixed."
1, The sweater is as cute in person as it is online.
0,"Sad :( I love this top so much online. i received it yesterday in the mail and unfortunately i am very disappointed.  there is nothing wrong with the quality but i do think it looks more appealing online. also, this top is probably not for anyone with a large chest. it looks nice and drapey on the model. when i put it on it just makes me look fat and the top (thanks to my 38dds) looks more like a swing top. i'm sure it's a lovely top on very thin people with a smaller chest."
1,Love this sweater Such a festive sweater and i've received many compliments anytime i wear it. unique and fun to wear!
0,"Cheap material -- poorly made Do not buy this dress for full price. the design looks great but after receiving the dress, the material is made of extremely cheap slinky-ish polyester that you would find at a f21 store. the stitching is horrific and created an uneven ""hump"" on the back seam. just absolutely poor poor quality."
1,"Beautiful sweater I really love the look of this sweater and it seems to be of great quality. i will say the fit is a bit odd. the sweater is on the short side but is very roomy through the neck and shoulders. i ordered a small (5'6""; 120lbs) and would change for an xs but i'm afraid it would be cropped. i'm keeping it but wish it had a more uniform fit.
really beautify workmanship though."
1," This sweater is absolutely gorgeous. the design and structure might make your shoulders look a little bigger, but i absolutely love it. it has a little boxy shape but i feel like it goes with te style. love it! get tons of compliments every time i wear it."
1,"Ready for a cruise! I'm going on a cruise to the bahamas and when i saw this dress, i had to have it! i love it! it's soft to the touch and super fun to twirl around in! the seams are a bit awkward and that's due to the bottom part's shape. i have a slender navy blue belt that i pair it with to hide the waist seam and to accent my waist more. a navy blue sash/scarf/ribbon around the waist can do the trick too!"
0,"Boxy, navy color looks darker than pictured I tried this sweater on in the store. i love the design and was hoping it would look as good on me as it does on the model. first off i should point out that the navy color in the featured photo looks much lighter than the sweater does in person. some of the photos accurately represent how dark the blue is (it almost looks black) but the featured photo shows it more like a medium navy. secondly, anyone looking to purchase should know it is very warm. if you are buying to wear mostly indoors you"
0,"Beautiful, but... Picked this up in the store today, but didn't try it on first. it is even more gorgeous in person than the photo, but sadly this did not work for me when i got it home to try on. there is wonderful detailing, but somehow the bulky knit fit was just not flattering on. i think it is the thick knit and slightly shorter length. the knit was bulking up in all the wrong places and visually added about 10l bs to my frame. such a shame---really wanted to keep this beautiful sweater but it just did not l"
0,Humongous I found this as a return in the store. i tried the xxs. i was so excited because it looked really cute on the hanger. it was so huge- looked like i was wearing an xl.
1,Fabulous dress! Fits well and appropriate for work or going out! love the pop of red in the beads! could easily be worn with a jacket well into fall! i typically wear a 6 and a small fit perfectly. not too short- but hits above the knee! this will get lots of wear!
1,This dress is very versitile This is a great dress that can be dressed up or worn with flip flops. i also love that it has pockets :)
1,Beautifully made casual dress I tried this dress on in the store and loved it. i am not a aize 2 (usually a 6) but the dress's a-line shape allowed me to get a size 2. the dress is well made and the orange beaded work is lovely. a very pretty dress that i will wear a lot.
1,Great dress The color and fit of this dress is fabulous. i can't wait to wear it out.. casual with flats or dressy with heels. love it!
1," Really like the style/aesthetics of the top. it is very unique, and works with a variety of pants. the only downsides are that it flares out a bit more than it appears on the model, and it arrived somewhat wrinkled. i am 5' 6"" 125 pounds and i got a size 4. looking forward to wearing this a lot in the fall."
1,"Fun and gorgeous suit, but not for me This was the first suit i've ever ordered online and the first one piece i've tried since i was a very young girl, so i was a little skeptical going into this. i'm 5'9"", ~145 lbs, 34b, with a pear shape and short torso. i was pleasantly surprised by the overall fit--the length was right, the bottoms fit really well (i was nervous about the boy short/hip hugger design), and the suit was just very comfortable and cute. however, something about the cups just didn't work with my chest; my breasts di"
1,Beautiful top! Im so glad this shirt came to me just as pictured and described. color and fit was spot on! thank you!
1,"A dress for everyone This dress is just beautiful - color, fit, length, style, stretchy fabric...everything about it seems to flatter all body types. it also passes the armhole test - no issues there! the back closure detail adds a little something special to it. i tried it on with black leggings and a black leather jacket just for fun, and it looks surprisingly cute for multi-season wear. is it overpriced? absolutely, but so is 99% of the stuff at retailer. i will be keeping it anyway though because i think it's a tr"
1,"Fun everyday dress I did like the dress, but don't love it. i think it would have been better for me if it were snugger. the xxs petite was still loose and i found that there are so many dresses with the similar fit, i decided to pass... i also do like both colors, the brown is a better choice for me on my skin tone (warmer), but both are nice. i am 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist."
1,"Surprised I don't usually go for swing style dresses as i am petite, but this one was totally cute. i like the color a lot, wasn't sure it would work as i am rather pale, but it is nice. the xs p was returned at my store, why i tried it on... winner. 115 lbs, 26.5 in waist, 30dd chest. i can see myself wearing this in summer, spring or fall (with boots)."
1,Worth it! This suit is great for curvy and slightly flawed figures. the vintage look delivers full coverage that still looks sexy. not your mother's one-piece.
1," Love it! this suit is high quality and comfortable. it's a little tricky to get on but once it's on, it's perfect. i have a small chest and the fit of the cups and twisted fabric makes me feel totally comfortable. i usually wear two pieces, in fact this is my first one piece since i was ten, and i love it."
1,Easy to wear! Love this dress...light and comfortable and fits true to size. i have larger shoulders and the halter design is really flattering. you can dress up or dress down which is a huge plus for me!
1,"Pretty - but tight arms! This is a very pretty top - flowy w/o making you look larger, a nice blue, and a good transition piece. but, the upper arms are so tight on me! i'd say i have pretty average arms - definitely not super thin, but not large either. i keep staring at it and hoping the fabric will give a bit so i can keep it, but sadly, i just don't think the material will be very forgiving. if you have truly thin arms, i think it would be a great top. maybe sizing up would also work, but for me at least, i think it"
1,"Pretty, but very big I am not one to complain about things being cut too big as i generally don't mind lose and flowing. however, this dress is very ""bell"" shaped and the fabric is just thick enough that it doesn't really lay well, at least not like it does in the photo. i bought the earth-tone color way and i felt like i was wearing a macrame version of the liberty bell. it is also a lot shorter than i was expecting. if it weren't so short, i would try sizing down. it is very good quality and the slip is super soft"
1,"Love this swimsuit! This swimsuit is super cute and retro. the ruching on the stomach is very flattering and the shaping on the padded cups makes for a very nice hourglass 1950s-inspired look. great for us ladies without a lot up top. i felt very marilyn monroe in this suit! i love the back coverage, too -- your butt doesn't hang out of the suit and the boyshort style offers a good amount of coverage without being dowdy.

i was worried about sizing when i first ordered it. based on what everyone said, i went with a"
1,"Luv this dress! I saw this dress in the window at the roc center nyc store and knew i had to have it. the one i chose has muted earth-tone colors of tan, green, gold. looks stunning with my complexion. the blue one was nice too, but the earth tones were more flattering on me.  the fit is loose and flowy, very comfortable, but not baggy. i'm 5'5, 34c, 115ish and i took my usual xs. i plan to pair it with a muted green leather jacket and brown boots for the fall. can't wait!"
1,"Beautiful! Love this top. fits true to size. not to boxy,, sleeves are so cute! looks very rich. a must have in your wardrobe!"
0,"So sorry i had to return I ordered in blue. so excited at arrival; it looked gorgeous...then i tried it on! i'm 5', 106#, 34d and my upper arms are a little muscular. i normally order 2p (sometimes 0p)...and never a problem. this top was sooo tight under the arms and at the upper arms...if i tried any movement would have probably ripped out the seams! maybe i just received a product that was mis-sized, or defective. all i can say, if you have skinny arms, you'll love it."
1,"Great for transitioning into fall Very cute dress, just way too big. i ordered it online, wish i would have gone a size smaller."
1,Flowing comfort I love love this top.  it is so pretty!  i am stopped by strangers complimenting me on it. it is so flattering.  i wear a cami under it and find it perfect!  it hits at the perfect length below the waist on my jeans.  it's easy to throw on and go.  casual but dressy.  the sleeves do bell out so you may need to watch them when you eat.  i've accidentally caught them on my plate.  the shirts washes well.
1,"Love the sleeves! I ordered this in the lavender and love the rich color! looks great with my blonde hair. the bell sleeves, which are all the rage right now, add to the feminine look. i wore it with jeans and espadrilles for a fab boho look!"
0,"Super unflattering I'm 5' 5"", 150 lbs, 32dd, normally a 28p or 29p in pants. i ordered an 8 and probably should have gone with a 10. it was super unflattering?the print was overwhelming for my pale skin, it made my thin waist look larger than it really was, and rode up the inside of my thighs. i have a similar bathing suit from modcloth that's 1/3 of the price and 20x as flattering. if you have thick legs, this may not be the suit for you. i returned it--so fast."
1, I wasn't sure i'd like the sleeves but they are very cute and just the right length. i really like how the top fits and is very flattering
1,"Great for bigger busts I absolutely love the retro look of this swimsuit. i first saw it on blogger amber fillerup-clark (barefoot blonde) and i knew i had to have it. this is the first one piece suit i've purchased in about six years. i've avoided one pieces because most of the ones i tried made me feel frumpy, and the mono-kini look just looked odd on me. i have a smaller frame and a larger bust (32ddd), so finding swimsuits that fit properly is a challenge. i am a size 4 but i ordered a size 6 after reading reviews"
0,"White tent First off, this runs very large. i'm normally an 8 and sized down to the 6 but probably could have done a 4. it looked like a tent on me. the top part is lovely, i just think the bottom is way to large and not flattering. this one is definitely going back especially with all the white dress options they have out now."
1, Love the fit of pilcro jeans. it's always a struggle to find a white jean that is flattering around the thighs and doesn't show off lumps and bumps! these are terrific quality indeed.
1," Very nice basic tee shirt, soft and comfortable, well cut."
1,"Flattering and stylish I got this top in white/rust and it is darling. the lining keeps it from being too see through. the bell sleeves add style without getting in the way thanks to the shorter length. i get many compliments each time i wear it. i am 5'1"", 103 lbs and take xs- fit was true to size."
1,"Soft and cozy I sized up to an xl and although they have everything you want in a yoga/lounge pant, they just didn't thrill me enough to keep them. they're soft, warm and comfy but i didn't care for the bulk or fit of the foldover waistband. and they were too long so i returned. if you're built like the model, you'll love these."
1,"Great coverage I ordered the correct size due to reading other reviews who gave their height , weight, and chest size. thank you all for that! i am 5 feet 5 3/4 inches tall and fluctuate between 135 lbs and 139 lbs. i wear 36b in bras. i ordered an 8. fits great! the coverage is adequate on my backside. the rouching is very nice in the mid section for self conscious women like me. the color is fun and beautiful. the quality is excellent! i love the bra support! there are real bra cups sewn in! it was pricey bu"
1,"Great go to dress! Love this dress.fabric is very soft and flattering. i paired it with wine suede boots. great material, i will be able to wear it most of the year with different accessories. i am fairly busty so i sometimes order an xl but read the reviews and ordered a large and was just fine. great go to dress!"
0, I love the color and style of this dress. and i wanted to love it too? sadly the fabric is truly inferior to the retailer brand and definitely not worth the price of the dress. checked it out in store and so glad i did as it would have been returned for sure.
1,Bohemian bliss Saw this in my local retailer and thought it was stunning. i usually wear a size 8 because of my broad shoulders but ended up taking a 6 in this top. it was not tight in the arms (don't have super skinny arms) and the fabric flows nicely (not too much). the embroidery is amazing and am sure this top will be in rotation quite a bit!
1," The color and fit is amazing on this dress. i am 5""7 and went with the small and the length wasn't too short either."
1," I am in love with these jeans!! i can't say enough about them. they are so forgiving yet keep their shape great. they are soft, comfortable and are a great color. these jeans have the perfect amount of stretch while being substantial and durable."
1,"Quite flattering! I ordered this last week and received it yesterday and have to say it is a lovely dress. the fabric is light but looks quite rich, making one want to touch the textile. the dress pattern reminds me of a missoni. oh, the dress is lined. i purchased the blue pattern, and am planning on wearing it to work on friday."
1,"Beautiful! Dress it up or go casual - this dress has it all. well made and comfortable where other ""lace"" rubs the wrong way under arms - this is super soft. cant wait to pair different shoe colors and jewelry."
1,"Very pretty on I saw this dress in the store, there are actually two different colors for this dress: one is blue/purple/silver, the other one is orange/tan/gold. both of them look very nice in person, especially with the shimmery thread. i tried on the blue/purple/silver one and i found it runs large. for reference, i am 5'2"", 34b, 120 lbs, usually wearing a size s or sp in retailer dresses, i found size xs fits me better in this design. the material of this dress drapes nicely, but it is kind of itchy,"
1,"Perfect summer dress The cut of this dress is what drew me to order it, but it is so much more! first, the fabric is more of a raw silk, which is more like a soft linen than silk.. it's also got a very soft lining that feels great on the skin, and it has pockets! love a dress with pockets! i also love that the design is on the front and back. i am 5' 4"", 133 lbs and a 36c, and ordered a size 6. it's a little big on the sides, so i probably should've returned it for a 4, but it wasn't big enough to make it annoying o"
1,Cute and easy Beautiful dress that is easy to just throw on and go. i bought both colors. though it is loose it is still flattering. it has a good length and movement. i'm normally a m/l or 10/12. i took a medium as it is pretty loose fit.
1,"Beautiful top! This top is so perfect for the fall... flowy, beautiful embroidery and paired with jeans and brown boots,gorgeous! wore it once and got a lot of compliments!  i'm 5'2"" 125 and ordered a size 4. 2 worked too but just a tad tight in the arms. :)"
1,"Fall in love/spring into style This sweet dress is perfect for fall and spring because the knit is not too thick, the drape allows layers and the colors are very versatile.  the style is loose if you stay tts but will be a slimmer fit if you size down.  if your body habitus is super slender, definitely size down.  the liner slip is soft and the back side of the knit is a bit scratchy.  i think this dress is beautiful and best of all, forgiving.  i'm happy to have tried both colors--the problem is picking which one to keep!  m"
1,Sava silk halter dress I wish summer was longer so i could have the opportunity to wear this more. much more eye-catching and unique in person than the photo. 5 stars.
1,So many compliments Love this dress. i wore it with black boots and got so many compliments super comfortable.  i feel like this dress will never go out style.
1,"Great fitting jeans I saw these on the freshly cut + promo discount & decided to order my usual size 28 reg in pilcro. a great fit & appreciate the midrise. not too snug or baggy. look pretty much on me as in the model pic except they fall abt 1"" below my ankles. i am only 5'3"" so not a surprise they are a little longer on me but it's really ok. fyi - the front button & back pocket tacks are gold which gives a classy look to these jeans. just love.. & love the price too! 5'3"", 117#"
1,"Super modern and chic I am a huge fan of tracy reese because her dresses are works of art, great quality, and super wearable for both work and play, and this is no exception. i purchased this dress in regular xs (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips) and it falls right above my knees. for the office or more conservative setting, i add a belt and a sweater. otherwise, i wear it alone for a carefree look. i chose the regular size because the dress is voluminous and it gets about an inch shorter when i belt it, and it looks"
1,"This product has great features I like this dress. the floral pattern and little red beads. others may think it is baggy, however, i like this type of the style."
1,"Great dress! This dress is very comfortable, not itchy at all and looks great. runs on the large side and is a tiny bit unflattering in the middle but it's still a worthwhile buy!"
0,"Disappointed! I wanted to love this dress because the color is so amazing, but the arm holes are huge! i am petite and tried this on and it just sadly didn't work."
1,Very cute dress The dress runs large so if you go down a size you will be fine. looks awesome on. love it. would definitely recommend
1,"White tee with a ""detail""on back I ordered a small. i'm usually a petite small. i like my tees not fitted. i will exchange it for an xs. soft. it has like the look of a seam down the middle of the back. i barely noticed it. i think it makes a plain tee shirt a little unique. good quality. 100 percent cotton. it's a white tee. soft."
1,"Stop reading this and just buy them! Let me start by saying i am incredibly picky about pants. i hate probably 99% of the pants i try on. pilcro is the consistent exception, and these are probably my favorites of all my pilcros (perhaps tied with the cords). runs true to pilcro size, which i find to be a bit large--most of my other pants are a 30, and a 29 is quite comfortable in these. despite being leggings, they're thick/structured enough to wear to work."
1,"Summer time lovin' Flattering, flirty, bright, beautiful romper. i wish it come in other colors because i want more!!!!"
1,"A must buy! Just received my second pair of pilcro legging jeans; having bought them last year as well. great for work, girls night out, date night. so comfortable, with lots of stretch; fortunately they hold their shape and don't stretch out. they feel like pjs, but are nice enough for work. my pair from last year have held up well (color-wise), however some of the leg seam stitching unraveled-- hence the reason for 4 stars in quality. hopefully, these will fare better.

regardless, i highly recommend!"
1,"Great top Great top. i bought it for my daughter and it is well made and the fabric is very nice. she is 5'4"" and it reaches just the top of her jeans."
1,"Great going-out top! Love this top! however, i'm biased bc i love hd, such originality in their clothing, even in something as simple as a black tank top. also comes with the bra strap snaps, but i find my straps still show in the back, need to wear a strapless or criss cross. please note that the sides sort of rise up to meet the laces. so the more you tighten the laces, the more it comes up (hard to explain!). if you are at all even a little sensitive about a muffin top, again with low rise, it would show! still l"
1,"Pricey for shorts but like I tried these on as i needed bottoms to try on some tops (and i was wearing a dress), but ended up liking them. the fit is snug but comfortable, they didn't ride up and the denim is supple. color is nice too, looked really nice with a swing tank that i half tucked. i have muscular thighs, so shorts are not an easy thing for me... anyway, recommend (tried on 25: 115 lbs, 26-27 inch waist)"
1,Love these! exactly what i was looking for I love these shorts. i don't understand why they aren't sold out yet! they are buttery soft and fit great. i usually wear a size 26 and these are true to size. they are my go to run around shorts but because they are a dark wash so i feel like i can wear them out with a cute top to dinner even. love!!
0,"Lovely material, a miss otherwise I love the material on these shorts. unfortunately, that's all i love. the fit is awkward and i'm an easy fit. they're boxy in the body / legs and a bit tight in the waist, causing me to not be sure whether to place the elastic waist higher or lower and neither one works well. sadly, couldn't keep these just for the pretty fabric."
1,"Beautiful piece. I am 5'8"" 135 lbs, broad shoulders and normal waste to hip ratio. this jumper fits beautifully and material flows just enough to be forgiving but flattering. love love love, definitely happy with myself for the splurge. can't wait to wear it out!!!"
1," I loved these shorts; however, they seemed to be doomed! i received these on july 2nd & wore them at for a party we had on july 3rd, with the top shown. the fit was true to size, style & quality were nice. during the day i first ripped them on a low arbor gate latch, then later they were splashed with red wine when my husband startled me & i threw my red wine in the air. typically, i am very careful and do no have an issue with ruining my clothes. he felt so bad he asked me to get a new pair. i"
1,I love stevie everything Stevie styled ags are my favorite! love the waist! love the length of the short! not to long and not too short
1,"Short shorts! I am 5'0"" tall and i have decent legs. these shorts are pretty short! i am sending them back for a small to see if they'll give a little more coverage. i should mention that they are absolutely darling and i bought the top that is shown with them. it's going to be a great little summer outfit. the quality of this brand is always very good."
1,"Great style! This jumpsuit is gorgeous...on the right body. if you have a tiny rib cage and a flat stomach and an average to short torso, this may fit you beautifully. on me, the defined gathered area you see in the photo was very tight and hit me in an odd place. the fabric is a great weight and it is a beautiful and rich looking. i really wanted this to work out for me. as for size, i found it just a little tight in the hips, waist and rib cage."
0,Pilling after one day I love the pilcro serif legging jeans but these were a big disappointment. if you have any thigh at all don't bother.
0, This one didn't work for me. ordered this and the riverdeck tee as similar vein. riverdeck was cute and flattering cut. this one was boxy on me and didn't work. a bit too wide so sending back.
1,"Love I tried this top on in the store today and had to have it! i love the laces up the sides and the zipper in back. it is short - i found a really cute pair of ""baggy"" pants with a black pattern to pair with it.
in retailer shirts i wear an xs or s - or a 0 or 2. i got this in a 0 and it fit perfectly."
1," I love this jacket. i'm 6' tall, 160lbs, 30"" waist and a 34d. i normally go for an 8/medium and i bought a medium. i love it! slightly cropped, barely snug fit but i can still snap it closed. totally warm enough for california fall/winter. i like that the sleeves don't have sherpa in them... make it easier to layer! i bought the ""silver"" corduroy and it's less white than the photos, but it still fits the bill perfectly. love that it's machine washable, too. it also has pockets!"
1,Black leggings This is one of my favorite pair of pants. they don't stretch out while wearing and wash well. no pilling or shrinking. they can either be worn like leggings or pants. i wear a size 2 pants but got these in a 27 because i don't like them super fitted.
1,"This is happiness (for my postpartum body!) Ok, so this is true to size-- i recently had a baby (i gained a lot of weight), am in the process of losing it and took the risk of buying a jumpsuit online. i am 5'3 with a long torso, short legs, and a big fat butt so buying pants (especially rompers) are almost impossible. lengthwise, this fits me like pants. the draping is so flattering and the color combination is splashy but not loud. i had to review this as soon as i realized it fit. i don't think i've ever been so happy with an retailer pu"
1,"Beautiful, stylish, goes with everything This is a cute,somewhat dressy top-- it has a bit of a sheen, ties on the sides, and a zipper down the back. it'll go great with pants or skirts. the fit, though, is huge-- i'm normally an 8, but i got this in a 4! machine-washable even though it says ""dry clean."" if it doesn't say ""dry clean only,"" you can wash it."
0,"Pretty, but not at this price I was very excited to find this jumper in a store to try on. the small was huge (im 5'8, 130lbs), the xs was better but perhaps a bit short in the upper body, making it feel tight/stretched against my shoulders. i love the print and style, and would have bought it if it was $100 less. however, at the current price, it needs to fit perfectly, which sadly it did not."
1, Awesome top. slightly cropped. great to dress up jeans or wear with pants or skirt for evening out.
1,"Pretty jumpsuit. This is a pretty jump suit, true to size, looked flattering on me, lovely soft tencel like fabric and pretty design fabric. however, the sides are cut too deep and it's impossible to wear a strapless bra or any kind of bra without the bra showing. i tried without one and that definitely doesn't work, so back it went to the store."
1,Classic and comfortable Great bra. fits well. works under tighter t-shirts. just be aware that the straps do clearly read calvin klein. more mauve than pink.
1, Loved this romper! wish it was offered in petite... arm sleeves are too long once it's off shoulders.
1,Perfect sweater skirt Love this sweater skirt by tracy reese. i'm a huge fan of tracy reese clothing and this skirt doesn't disappoint. super comfortable. the colors in the skirt are amazing too. many different colors to pull from. i can see myself dressing this up or dressing it down with flat boots and a denim jacket. i felt it fit tts. i usually wear a small in retailer skirts that aren't numeric sizes. got this one in small.
1,"Dreamy I can't say enough about this sweater! it light, delicate, soft, vintage chic........i could go on and on! buy it already!!!"
1,"Perfect! I am 5'3"" and 34c and bought the regular xs. it fits exactly as on the model. soft and light and comfortable, but very sheer. cami required (have to try this with both a tucked in cami and a cami bra). great with midi skirts and culottes and maxi skirts and palazzo and flared pants. love!"
1,"Beautiful skirt, does run small I ordered this skirt in my usual xs. when it arrived it looked tiny. the xs was almost impossible to get on. i ended up returning the xs for a medium, which fit perfectly (and is work appropriate). my measurements are 5'6"" and 125. my recommendation would size up two sizes."
1,"Gorgeous look, weird lining. i'm on the fence. I don't know that i'll keep this, although i really want to. i love the style and the fabric, and the length is perfect for me (i'm 5'3"" and i ordered the petite length - it hits me below the knee). as another reviewer mentioned, this dress runs small in the chest area and does not provide any stretch. luckily for me, that wasn't an issue.

my trouble is this: the liner stops just above the slits on the side, and it's way more noticeable in person than in the photo. the liner is sewn in and yo"
0," The skirt is comfortable and as pictured. it also ran tts. i'm 5'5"" tall and weigh 140 lbs. i had the medium and didn't need to size up to a large. when you put the skirt on a normal body, it looks like you are wearing an easter egg... and not in a good way."
1,"Adorable pom details Wow, i wish this would have worked for me. the pom details are truly adorable and give the sweater that extra added touch. i agree with the other reviewer that the ""crop"" style is almost too much and gives an awkward fit. i am short, 5'2"" so it cut me off in the wrong area (i bought a petite xs). the material is delicate but that is part of the charm so i didn't have a problem with that at al. my problem was the fit-- a bit too boxy for my build. wish it would have worked but i'll have to admire"
0,"Huge jacket, wash color is not as pictured Like one of the previous reviewers, when my jacket arrived, it was not in the great dark wash pictured online. it was in a basic, medium denim wash. i like the wash pictured online; i did not like the wash the jacket came in. additionally, know that it is just huge. i ordered my usual size (medium) and understood that the jacket was meant to be roomy and swingy, but there is no way that one size down would be enough to compensate for how swimmingly large it was. i never tried an xs, but it was s"
1,"Great strappy back I absolutely love this bra-it is the most comfortable, aesthetically pleasing sports bra i have ever owned. i love the straps! they take some patience to get aligned properly once the bra is one, but afterward it looks amazing. the bra itself is soft and the padded inserts actually stay in place without much manipulation so they are aligned properly. when moving, i do not have any areas that rub or get irritated uncomfortably. i absolutely love this bra. it gives me the support i need for a high"
1,"Love the style I was very happy to receive this as a birthday gift. i usually wear an xs or s in clothes i buy from retailer. i was given this in a s, but it wasn't even close to meeting in the front, so i returned it for a m. it doesn't button anyway, but i didn't want it to look like it wouldn't meet at all. i tried on a size s sweater in this brand while i was in the store, and it fit perfectly, so this one is just running small. overall, i love the lace detail on the front and the softness of the sweater."
1,Pretty in front I like everything about this shirt except i wish the embroidery was on the back too. gives it a cheaper look by only having it on the front. you will look prettier coming than going for sure!
1,"This is another ubiquitous swing top Yes, it's a swing top, just like many of the other swing tops retailer is offering this season. i find this silhouette unflattering on me, being top heavy, so i was frustrated to discover the swing-ness only after i ordered it and it arrived at my house. it also runs huge, with big gaping arm holes. the sleeves are cute and fluttered. the black panels on the sides are semi-sheer. it is a pretty boxy top, which the photo doesn't seem to capture. order at least a size smaller than usual."
1,"Love this pattern This top has a great pattern that could be worn with many different things. it was a bit short for me, as i have a long torso, but i wish it had fit right!"
1,"Great vest! I joked with my husband that if i were with the resistance  (star wars), this is what i would wear! i actually really like it. it will look best with a girly skirt and blouse. the quilting is lightweight and the fit is slim. well made too."
1,"The best basic tee If you like a slightly heavier, non/clingy basic tee, this is it. i wore the long sleeved version all fall and winter, rotating colors, and i've been wearing these with shorts and leggings since i got them. the colors are great, fabric is quality, and the ribbon detail in the back gives these a little flare."
0," I got this dress in the mail today and really thought i was going to love it. the color is a beautiful rich red, which was a nice surprise. i was expecting more of a dusty red from the picture. love the fabric - soft and appears to be good quality. the length is perfect - hit right at my knees (size small). the flow of the dress is great as well. the ultimate flaw would be the arm and neck holes. the neck hole was choking me but yet a little loose at the back of the neck - almost like it was on"
0,"Beautiful print, bad design When i ordered this dress, i thought to myself ""hmm, it seems a little close to showing some side boob, but maybe that's just the angle of the photo."" flash forward to me trying it on in my home - ""yep, that's some side boob."" it is very low cut under the arms. if you're super slim, this might be a good look, but on a curvy gal with some boobs, it was obscene. also, i'm a solid 12 in most retailer brands, so i ordered a l and an xl just in case. the xl wouldn't even zip up. returning."
0,"Bummer! This dress makes me so sad...the textured stretchy fabric, color, length, and overall swingy fit are spot on. as another reviewer noted though, the armholes and neck totally ruin the dress. the neck is tiny, which i could have gotten over once it was on, but the arm holes were just awful - too big all around (too tall of a cut plus too wide of a cut). basically, you could see my bra plus from the front there was unflattering exposure near the armholes. it could have been so good, but alas, but t"
0,"Wide bodied tee There is simply a ton of fabric on this tee. i am a size 8 on top, with a fairly thin upper body but still an 8. at retailer i often order small for swingy tees, medium for more slim-cut. this tee in the small was huge. the shoulders fit well, but the body was so big and was a weirdly long length. just odd, especially for $78..."
1,"Pretty blouse This is a very nice blouse. usually i am size 12-14, bought size l and it fits very well. would not size up. the fit is very forgiving (hides tummy); i like the v-neck. fabric does not look like polyester and of good quality. the blouse is versatile, looks good with skinny dark or white jeans. recommend!"
1, Loved this tee but embroidery started to unravel even before being washed. i paid full price for this top and wasn't disappointed but needed to return due to the embroidery problem. this tee is a mustard color.
1,"Pretty details This is a lightweight sweater...good for the office and summer evenings.  here in so. cal it's a good weight sweater year round.  love the lace trim.  runs a bit large but not too bad.  color is a light cornflower blue, not lavender.  this works for me but if you're looking for a lavender sweater, you might want to think twice."
1,"The perfect spring/summer staple I have this tee in every single color and love it. this shirt is so soft, airy, and comfortable, and the ribbon embellishment on the back dresses it up a little. i love wearing leggings or skinny jeans with it and accessorizing with an infinity scarf. i normally wear a size small, but i sized up to a medium this time. there is very little difference in the two sizes, but i liked the modest increase in length. i'm glad that i did this, because the tees shrunk ever so slightly after being in the d"
1,"Such a fun skirt! This skirt is very comfortable and moves well. i'm 5'4"" and ordered a 2p, which fits perfectly. the length hits just above the top of my feet. the patterned chiffon is sheer and the skirt has a short black slip underneath that ends just above my knees. i have a small waist and wider hips, but found the inner slip to fit loosely enough so that it doesn't ride up when i walk or sit. the two slits on either side were a great length and make this skirt both flirty and quirky. you'll get tons of comp"
1,Love This top is fun. loose but still flattering. the colors are nice and the fabric soft. can fit well. (115lbs 30 dd)
1,"Very nice, but also very flowey I was surprised when my friend tried this on (they dind't have my size in store so she did), how ,uch materil there is on this top. it is very beautiful, but might be too much on a petite frame. the back is almost like a mini train, which is pretty ocol in my opinion. great colros in person too, yes, a tiny bit of shimmer :-)"
0,"Really wanted to like it, but... This top is so pretty in the photos, but it just did not work out for me. it is more of a pale pink color than off-white like in the photo and it just hung on me weird. i felt like it was true to size, but made me feel very boxy. i can say it was very well made, so maybe i'm just not the right body type for it. for reference, i'm 5'5"" and 135lbs. the small fit perfectly, but was a bit too wide at the bottom for my taste. i was willing to spend the money if it would have been perfect, but i'll sa"
1," This vest is perfect! i live in florida aka where it is hot almost every day of the year. it makes a great layer piece, but isn't too warm!"
1,"Runs huge,could work for someone taller? First of all, mine arrived in a regular denim shade, not the dark wash shown. also, the style is more like a blazer, and it was huge. i am 5'2"" and ordered the petite xs but even xxs would have looked like a baggy blazer. as well, the sleeves came barely past my wrists, they are designed to cuff as the model has done? perhaps on someone taller and younger it would look edgy and chic! the quality is excellent with some nice details. this might be one to try in person, if you can."
1,"Nice top I would give this top a 4.5. it is a very pretty top, i love the embroidery, but runs a little short for my taste. it still meets past the top of my pants, but barely. this is why i didn't give this top a 5. i am 5'9"" so i think for a petite person the length would be perfect."
0,So disappointed I saw this online and went to the store to try it on. so glad i did! it did not work on me at all! it is so wide - just did not look right. it was also not flattering at the neckline either. i thought it was beautiful until i had it on! too bad - wanted to love it!
1,"Shirt looked emerald green in the store! Just bought this today in xl and i like it a lot. i am very busty so if i see an xl in most things i will try it on. i probably could have fit into a large though. this will look cute with leggings as it is long enough to cover your butt. i didn't know about the emerald color as it looked in store lights, but it is more blue-green at home. i like it even better. well worth $48!"
1,"Nubby footless tights These are amazing quality. i agree, size up to not have such a sheer effect. i would not wear them as just leggings without a long shirt covering the butt.

they are warm. i wore them under some ski stuff. kept me warm.

i also washed them on handwash cycle. seemed to be ok."
1,Love these skinny jeans! These are the perfect high-waisted skinny jeans. they fit tts and don't stretch out. are the perfect length for cute falls or tucked into boots. i adore them!
1,"I love denim I love this top. of course i love most things that are denim, or look like denim. this is a fun twist on a denim shirt, the flutter sleeves and side panels make it different and eye catching. i have gotten so many compliments on it when i wear it! pairing this top with white or black pants or a skirt allows me to wear denim to work and still look professional."
0,"Snag rag! The dress is beautiful in pictures, but all the reviews are dead on...it was full of snags when it arrived! 8 snags to be exact. and the fabric was heavier than i expected. sadly, had to return."
0,"The horror This vest looked so cute online but it's a disaster. the quilting is so bulky that the drawstring doesn't work properly and it just hangs. itlooks like something out of a costume closet that could be used for a peasant farmhand or a zombie movie. seriously, it's bad."
1,"Comfortable A nice rayon peasant shirt - like the sleeve length. good for a fuller figure, covers all the bad sports and very comfortable."
1,"Purple motif I like the look and fit of this shirt. can be dressed up or more casual. i got the purple motif, although i also like the brown and think that with all of the black in there (on the brown one) it would give a dressier look. i usually wear small from retailer, although this is my first blouse from this brand -- ended up getting an xs regular. i wanted the sleeves to fit at 3/4 as shown in the pics, but still be loose. i had a ton of extra room in the small, and the sleeves hit at wrist bone"
0,"Too short I love the look and feel of the material, but it was way too short - i don't even have a long torso! sadly, it's going back to the store."
0,"Shape odd The shape was not as nice on model, seemed like a lot of extra material."
1,Swanky fun! This elegant tank made me feel as if i had been transported to downton abbey. the velvet trim and the lovely embellishments of sparkle have an art deco delight. the swing of the fabric was playful and flattering. it's easy to dress up and dress down. fantastic top!
1,"Pretty, but try on before you buy! This shirt is much more flattering in person. if i hadn't seen it in store, i don't think it would have caught my eye. i like the mix of casual and dressy this top has (i got it specifically for teaching). the one thing i noticed, however, was that the first xs i tried on looked very big on me. i tried a second on and the fit was much more flattering! i highly recommend that you try on the specific blouse you plan to purchase before you actually buy it. i'm glad i tried a second on, because i th"
1,"Good green, runs big The fabric of these pants isn't like regular denim, rather it's soft and velvety in texture more like a chino. i love the dark saturated olive green. the pocket placement is very flattering on the rear. normally i wear a size 31 in premium denim and size 30 in paige jimmy jimmy jeans, however in this particular pair i needed a size 29. i definitely recommend sizing down!"
1,"Looks better on the model I wanted to give this a try but unfortunately disappointed with the fit and styling. i'm 5'6"", petite build and it consumed my slim figure. i loved the soft and coziness and the color is sweet too. i just felt like an awkward butterfly with the sleeves. pinning them back would have been alright but the execution didn't fit my frame. i would have liked it to be a tad longer too. i really hope they use this same material throughout the fall season because it's so cozy."
1,"Really nice sweater skirt This is a really nice fitting sweater knit skirt. the knit is soft and comfortable, heavy enough to smooth out some bumps but definitely shows your curves. i got medium and it's a little snug at the waist (i'm about 29-1/2"") but not so much to return it, and it fits the rest of me great. the only thing i wish was that they'd made the slip full length, it only goes about mid-thigh and sometimes when i get up the slip stays up while the skirt falls right, but not a big negative."
1,"Undecided on this one I thought this was love at first sight. the color and design are both stunning. and it drapes just perfectly over the body without looking like a tent. and the fabric feels nice, but the very first time i put it on, it snagged on my fingernail (and my nails are kept short and neat). this wouldn't have been a problem, except that the snag is very obvious. this material seems like it's going to snag on every single thing. i didn't dare even try on a necklace for this reason. i'm really undecided o"
0,Huge and shortedr than appears in picture This top is very wide and shorter than in appears in the picture. it also has a strong chemical smell. i've had a couple pieces with that smell in the past and the smell never washed out.
1,"Hot pink I ordered the medium pink in a size small. the color is more of a hot pink. it runs small through the shoulders and bust (i'm 34-d). i like that it covers your bum and the detail down the back. but it is going back, i may try a medium petite in a different color."
1,"Perfect shirt for leggings! This shirt is soft, long and is the perfect pair for leggings. i am only 5 ft. tall so this is extra long on me in the front and back! i bought it in 3 colors and hope to get more. i bought a large and love how it covers/hides my trouble areas!"
1,"Love it, not my color This shirt feels amazing, it is the perfect length for leggings. i have it in long sleeves also. i don't love the pink color i bought, it looks very different from the color pictured."
1,"Perfect leggings top I bought a few of these tops in the long sleeved version during the fall/winter, so i was super excited to see the short sleeved version come out! in this brand, i can wear an xs or s - i typically wear a s in retailer tops. if you need a tee that covers your lady parts when wearing leggings, this is it! it perfectly covers my rump and looks great. it's a nice weight, too. the detailing down the back is a nice touch."
1,"Not for the well endowed I ordered the medium, my usual size for flowing tops. it fits nicely, looks amazing from the front and looks slimming. then i turned to the side and oh my...my boobs protruded like two big balloons. i looked like wonder woman. there was plenty of fabric and it was billowy so it wasn't the size just the cut. i do have 34 g's but what the heck? the color is glorious but it has to go back."
1,"Great basic tee This tee is a great everyday staple.  it is comfortable and it also drapes very well.  i am 5ft 2in, 100lbs, 34b and i got this in xxs regular.  the length is perfect for leggings/skinny jeans, and it also looks really cute with a side knot in front. i have this is navy, green and black.  the navy color is brighter in person and in my opinion, looks better.  you can't go wrong. planning on getting the grey and pink one as well."
1,"Perfect Great tee! i usually wear an xs, but ended up getting this in xxsp. it is very long but the petite worked perfect on my 5'9"" frame."
1,"So cute! It is an expensive panty, but so worth the money! it is so unique and flattering!"
1,"Really cute top! I bought this top in both colors. the fit is perfect, the styling is very cute and it also is very comfortable!!
the only bad thing is that it snags on my jewelry !! :(. if it weren't for that i would rate it a 5!!"
0,"Pretty design. awful neckline I wanted to love this top. the neckline made it look strange on me. if i untied it, it looked sloppy. so, it went back. i love the print though."
1,Well..... I feel like a pessimist but then again nothings perfect. the only thing wrong with this stunning sweater is no button or snap so it just bags open. love it tho
1,"Lovely sweater This sweater is beautiful! it fits/drapes nicely, is a gorgeous color, feels soft, and is comfortable to wear. i'm generally a s or m in this brand and opted for the medium. the sleeves are pretty long--i have to role them up a bit or they cover half my hand, but that's all right--they look fine rolled. i highly recommend!"
1,"Not quite an every day staple, but nice top I wanted a nice, well-fitting top that would work with trousers, jeans, and skirts alike, and be a nice wardrobe staple. i got two of these tops - one size s (black) and one m (turquoise). the size m is gigantic and i have to return it. the size s is also a whole lotta shirt. the top is really long and has a multi-level bottom, as well as the pocket, making it not just a simple top but a rather ""loud"" top. nevertheless, i'm keeping the size s (black) as a versatile shirt that i can hopefully tuc"
1,Love Love this t-shirt. i rarely pay full price but love this and it's already out of stock. fits perfect. i tend to be short waisted so the length is perfect.
0,"Cropped I would have loved this top if it were the length pictured on the model, but it was a cropped length on me :("
1,"Odd color... I wanted to love this top... it's gorgeous w/the beading and velvet. however, it really goes with nothing. i'm tall and slender... the top felt a bit cropped when i tried it on. very wide flare shape... but that wouldn't make me return it. what is making me send it back is the color. the grey is gorgeous, but the fabric is a buttery yellow color. i think i was picturing it more cream. i don't know what in the world you could wear this with... grey pants?! a grey pencil skirt?! it looks terrible"
1,"Cute, very long in person I'm one of those people who is juuuust right between being regular and petite sized, so i have a hard time with some longer tunic styles. this tee is pretty fitted though the shoulders and bust, which makes the rest of the top kind of skim over the body. i like that, especially for those days where i feel a little bloated or like i want to hide out a bit. 

the fabric is very comfortable and not sheer. the little stripe down the back is a cute detail and it's in a slightly contrasting fabric w"
1,Paige jimmy skinny jeans The color and quality of these jeans is great. they were too large in my normal size. more of a boyfriend fit so size down.
1,Great shape I loved the shape of this basic jacket. it's perfect to through on to go to yoga or over a dress with heals.
1,"Oversized This shirt fit really really big! i ordered an xl but think i could get away with a l, if not a medium. sadly, it's going back :( otherwise, it's high quality and a beautiful design."
1,"Gorgeous but pricey I tried this on in the store to see if it would be my go to party top and splurge this season. i love the colors, textures, and embellishments. so lovely! ultimately the price and the very flowy fit (particularly in the back) made me put it back. another great item from moulinette soeurs, though!"
1,"Sparkle with delight I am an hourglass figure with a d cup. i rarely wear trapeze tops, as they make me appear larger. this is a very lovely top! fits nice (i was a medium) and hits nicely around hips (i'm 5'4). perfect for a special night out."
0,"Snaggariffic Sadly, this dress was trashed after wearing it for an hour. it snagged on everything -- my watch, my purse, my necklace. i had to go home, change, and return the dress later. impractical fabric ruined an otherwise lovely dress."
1,"Beautiful but maternity feel and look I had a feeling this might not work for me, so i decided to try it on in the store just to verify. i was quite right. i'm a tall gal with a size 36c, and it just billowed out and made me look wider. i normally wear a size m in tops and even this was a tad loose.

if you're petite/smaller framed, this will probably work for you. if you're tall and busty, this doesn't do us gals any favors, in my opinion.

it is a lovely top, and i loved the velvet trim at the bottom, the inner lining was decent,"
1,"Nice tee, but i was not aware how cropped it is The tee looks longer on the model. i am 5 feet 9 and this tee is showing of my belly which surprise me a bit. i thought it would hit the waist line. still, very nice tee, i love cotton, it simply is the best. colors are nice too."
1,Love the art deco detail on this versatile top! Can't wait to wear this out for the holidays! very comfortable and versatile - looks great with the vegan leather moto pilcro pants or any black skinny jeans for a more dressed up look -- i was originally going to pair with dark gray pilcro but the black moto with black heels looked really great in the store dressing room. beading is gorgeous and well done. velvet trim makes it luxe in my opinion. love that you don't need to pile on anything else to look polished -- top speaks volumes in and of
1,"Runs large. Nothing ""skinny"" about these pants. they're very cute. great quality. but they run a good one size large. size down!"
1,"Cute, runs large, less yellow!!! This shirt is really cute and runs large. i am a true s and this shirt came as big as what i would call an l.

i get that its a boyfriend t-shirt feel but it was still surprising. if you're an s i suggest xxs and so forth.

the color is yellow but not as yellow as the picture shows."
1,Perfect top I love the pattern and shape of this top. i can dress it up a bit with white pants and heels or dress it down with shorts and sandals. nice fabric and fit.
1,"New workhorse These tights are amazing! if i care for them well, i know they will last me seasons upon seasons."
1,Looks like a dream This dress was a gamble for a nautical them wedding next year. could not be happier. fabric was surprisingly stretchy which made it move like butter. the dress was stunning on and very comfortable which cannot be said for many gowns. i am so glad i took the gamble.
0,Wide wide wide Too wide! the design is cute but the wideness of the overall piece and arms made me lose my shape. you can't see your figure underneath at all. i don't like pieces like that. this went back.
1,Gorgeous top! I'm obsessed with this top! i got it for christmas and wore it to dinner with black pants and flats and got lots of compliments. the fit is cute and fun and the detail is about even prettier in person.
1,"Love the style - hate the dye left on my skin I recommend this product, but with the following reservations. 

the dye from the product colors my skin every time i wear this outfit. i love the fit and make of the jumper, but i hate that my skin looks blue by the end of the day. this is still happening after several washes, which makes me feel disappointed. it will dye your undergarments so choose wisely."
1," This is a cute dress, but not for me. 1. i think it runs very small, 2. it is super textured so if you don't want to add bulk (aka pounds) to your frame, this probably isn't for you. it's too bad it's online only because i would have benefitted from trying this on first. i'm sure it's probably adorable on smaller, thinner people. unfortunately, mine is going back."
1, Flattering to the figure. i'm bustier and slightly thicker waisted but this jumpsuit hugs and drapes in all the right places. normally i wear a medium petite but the regular small fit better (win!) i'm disappointed in the dye quality- my hands were blue from trying on the different sizes and i'm now on my second wash before wearing.
1,"Bof (blah) I ordered this on sale, after reading the review, but i was disappointed when i tried it on. the color is darker in person, which is better for me, but it looked dull on my skin tone (pale). also, teh sleeves poofed in a weird way on the top where the seam meets the neck. the overall cut is almost flattering, a little long still for me in petite, i felt like i was trying on a regular size. so not for me. for reference, i ordered the 0p (or xsp, not sure right now). i am 115 lbs, 30dd chest, 26.5"
1," I'm really pleased with this jumpsuit. it has great detailing not visible in the online image and the fabric is so soft and comfortable. the navy is lovely. i'm normally a medium or size 4-6. i ordered the medium online and it was far too baggy, especially on top. i tried on the small and x small in store and the x small fit exactly how i wanted (as worn by the model) and the pants were still long enough. i'm glad i didn't give up on it."
1,"So pleased! I needed an outfit for my son's christening 10 weeks after he was born. one thing i have to keep in mind with purchasing items now is how well they work for easy breastfeeding. this jumpsuit was perfect 'dressed up' with a cropped tuxedo jacket, cute shoes and jewelry. i felt so chic and not only did it fit my new post-baby shape, but was awesome for nursing him when needed. i felt comfortable all day and look forward to 'dressing it down' for less formal occasions. the material is so soft and i"
1,"Feminine & clean Size 8 always, 36c and i have broad shoulders...i found this true to size. the colors pop more and there is a cleavage alert, just letting you girls know. this is very figure flattering, especially with my body frame, it accentuates the right spots."
1,"Lovely. size up...maybe twice. This dress is so lovely in person, with more muted colors than pictured which will transition nicely into fall.  the overall cut of the dress is really flattering, especially for hourglass/ pear figures.  sadly, i had to return the dress because the arms were insanely small.  i after putting the dress on, i was worried i wouldn't be able to actually get it off.  if you have teeny, tiny arms...you'll probably be okay with your regular size.  if you have any kind of muscle (or squish :)), size up."
0,"Returning I thought that this dress would be perfect for my 60th birthday, however i was disappointed when i received it. it is extremely heavy from the beading and i just did not find it pretty in person. it did nothing for me. also, it runs small and was tight."
1,Fun way to floral up the closet! Looks cute on! not super form fitting... more of a flow fit. love the detailed stitching! so cute! floral pattern is fun not too busy! i loved the pockets... there is a bit of extra material but if you expect a flowy fit it's still totally lovely! i was worried about tightness in the arms but not a problem at all!!! i love this dress! lining makes it feel really well made!
0,Weird arms! The shirt is great except for the arms!! the band around the arms are tight and it makes the arm holes gape weirdly unless you are standing with your arms straight down by your side.
1,"Arm candy! I have long arms and they are not really small and the small fit me well. i think the fact that i have broad shoulders made this top work for me. definitely a keeper! i am surprised that the arms fit me though, because i often experience sleeves that are too tight when trying on tops. i'm glad that wasn't the case this time around. i'm 5'4"" 130-135lbs, depending on my appetite!"
1,"Just beautiful! Gorgeous dress and very flattering but it does run quite small in the bust (i'm 32 dd) and even the shoulder area (i rarely have problems there). i also find the side zipper a pain. sized up from a 2p to a 4p. the lace detail is especially beautiful and the color is more peachy than pink, the print quite saturated and not too pastel for early fall. i can see wearing it for 3 seasons, at least in ca."
0,"Too baggy in the top Like another reviewer said this was too baggy up top. the bottom length was good but arm holes were big and top was just too large. i'm 5'5"" 110 lbs and got xs. returned."
1,Long arms This shirt is nice in theory but you need to have pretty long arms to make it work. you also need to be average to tall in height.
0," Beautiful - ordered a s, i wear a 2 in most retailer items. hand washed in cold water, shrunk inches, yes inches! love maeve clothing, this shirt is gorgeous. before hand washing in the sink, it was large and flowy. now it barely fits."
0,Horrible fabric! The fabric of this vest is identical to a old white dish cloth! the cut of this vest is also bad! will be sent back!
1,"Beautiful dress! Very lovely print and fabric, there is more gray to the print's background than the photo shows. the shape is feminine and flattering, although the sleeves are more fitted on my arms. i bought this to wear to an early fall rehearsal dinner. very happy with the purchase!"
0,"Love/hate I love this jump suit.. sorta. looks great on but the dye rubs off on your skin. i washed it and its still happening. when you put your hand in your pockets, they come out blue, knees are blue, thighs, etc. i looked dirty by the end of the day. wish i could return it. fit and look great... not great after wear."
1,"Feel these socks! These socks feel amazing-i have them in both colors.

you would be surprised at the softness of these socks, yet they are slightly thicker than normal dress socks. i have weird toenails that tend to pierce through the tops of socks so a thicker sock is something that is very attractive to me. i feel like these would last a long time, with the bonus of making my feet feel like they are at the spa-these socks are soft?

these socks do not stay on my thigh so i have to use a garter and wear them li"
1,I love this sweater The medium fits perfectly. it's not too long or too short. the feel of the fabric is soft and not heavy at all. i love the detail in the bird too. it bright and colorful. overall a great buy!
1,Beautiful This dress was absolutely gorgeous and beautifully made. i ordered a size down as the other reviews stated the dress ran large. however it was massive. i wanted this dress so badly and mourn that i had to take it back to the store.
0,"Disappointing! The cut is too long and shapeless. if it was cropped, i would have kept it. the beads are delicate as another reviewer has said but i was prepared for that. too bad the fit just wasn't flattering. it's going back."
1,"Baggy yes, but meant to be I ordered:
xsp
xxs
xxsp

xxsp was the better fit, some people loved it some didn't like as much (thought it was baggy and are not used to seeing me in baggy clothing. but that being said, ti was comfortable, the cutouts fell right on spot on my shoulders, and it is a nice casual embellished look half tucked in some boyfriend jeans. i reordered mine as it had something stuck on it and it bothered me (like sticky white) i will re-evaluate when i get the new order only because there are sooo m"
1,"Muted colors but comfortable and slip-on This dress came with two pieces, a black sheath slip and a sheer pattern top-piece (pictured). it's pull-on and comfortable and flows well. i ordered online but wish i could have selected the pattern, as the fabric differs a little from front to back both in the pattern and intensity of color. overall though, a comfortable, light summer dress."
0,"Adorable but wide This was a near miss for me. i love the concept of the asymmetrical shoulder cutouts and the contrast of the beadwork to the simple gray crewneck, however, with some of the beads bulging out about 1/4 inch from the shirt, i have to say it almost bordered on gawdy christmas sweater status... but still cool. i actually thought this piece felt fairly sturdy and well-made, but the thing that got me and led me to return it was that even in an xs it was indeed cut wide. if it were a little shorter it"
0," Customers beware, there is no lining on this dress. i love the pattern however it would be a nightmare trying to find a slip to match the dress! i ordered it on line but i'll take it back to the shop."
1,"Love this shirt! Great fit, very soft fabric, and the sleeves are long enough!! great length in the body too."
1,"Love this sweater I saw this duster and immediately ordered it in cream. i have worn it every chance i get. it goes well with dresses as well as shorts or jeans. the length is perfect, the design is flattering, and the material is soft and comfortable. the sleeves are snug- but i like this feature, especially for light weight summer use over a tank top or sleeveless blouse. this will be a go to item. thanks retailer- another gem!"
0, I am normally a straightforward 10 - since i saw the other review i ordered down to an 8 - i am still swimming in it.i would say i have about 4 inches of extra fabric in the waist/hips. this is sized way too large. i love the softness of the checkers but i suspect this could get itchy fast on the arms where it touches the wool - but i won't find out cause i'm returning it?on the bright side i might fit a 6 which would be pretty nice.
1,"So many compliments! This skirt looks just like it does on the model. it is the prefect maxi skirt with lots of movement. i actually bought the off the shoulder top it is paired with. you can't tell on the model but the slit has buttons up it so you can undo or do as many of the buttons as you want to show off as much leg as you want. it is a little pricey,but well worth it."
1," Love these socks!!! i need to get more colors, they look so good on with boots with the lace showing!"
1,"Not your grandmas cardigan Love this!!! 115 lbs thin arms, the xs fits perfect. it's very flattering and has a boho vibe bc of its length. the arms are a little snug but in a very flattering way. haven't worn it enough yet to experience any pilling, but crossing my fingers. the cream is a really pretty pale oatmeal color imo. the grey is a black/grey speckled look."
1,"Perfect light weight sweater I ordered the cream colored duster after purchasing the grey one in store. i loved the grey one so much i had to get the other color. i love the length of the item. i am 5'9"" and don't feel like it is too short for me to get the look. it is light weight so i did not get too warm in it and will be able to wear it much of the year. i did wear it open as i feel that it runs a tad tight on the arms and torso when buttoned. however, i prefer the look of it worn open so that was not a problem for me."
1,"Love! I wore this for the first time today and got so many compliments! i'm a personal stylist and went to an event for the company i work for..which means i was in a room filled with stylish people, and i got nothing but compliments about my top. it is so comfy and i did worry at first about the beading and if it was too fragile, but it was fine. i sized down for this top but can't wait to wear it all fall and winter!"
1,"Dress up or down I love these pants! first, they are super flattering. for a new mom, the waist comes up high and tucks everything in without rolling over. second, they are versatile. you can pair them with pointed flats, boots or casual with sneakers. i am wearing mine with cream flats and the cream moth boucle colorblocked pullover sweater. also - normally i am an xl (especially for length!) but the large fit perfectly. i didn't want to say that they ran large, because they aren't too loose."
1,"Stylish and very warm It's like a coat for your legs, and lined with some silky fabric. the only flaw is a slight bulkiness where the fly hooks up.  i am a little sad that they don't have a petites, because i think this is proportioned for women 5'5"" and over, and i am only 5""3"". also not recommended for anyone with a tummy pooch. so tall women with somewhat flat abs - snap it up. it's a fabulous look for you."
1," This is a great alternative to a vest. it does have some blue in it, as the other review mentions. i gave it less of a rating due to the potential for snags. i am keeping it though for the sale price!"
1,"Gorgeous!! please bring this back, pretty please I absolutely love this dress... tried it on one size down from my usual...it fit but my size would be perfect and 8 and 10 are out of stock. it's stunning and i love it... i badly have to have it... please bring it back retailer:)"
1, Great dress.  fitted but flowing.  i like the colors and think it will easily grams iron to fall.  i am 5 ft 32 d 27 waist.
1,"I love the fit and length of this sweater! This is a gorgeous sweater with a great proportion in terms of length and fit. i am petite, so i worried that such a long sweater might look weird on me, but it actually makes me look slim and taller. i get so many compliments when i wear it. i ordered the xxs petite."
1,"Tts apart from snug arms Bought this in cream in my usual xs/0, (5'7"", 32b, 115lbs). it is a very flattering summer weight cardi which will work well with jeans and maxi dresses this summer. i would point out however that the sleeves are very snug - if you don't have thin arms then you may have to consider sizing up. i stuck with the xs even though i had to carefully pull the arms on because the s was just a little looser in the back. the sleeves are meant to be form fitting but i think they have been designed a little"
1,"If you have red hair you have to get this in kelly This top is soft feeling and i appreciate that it's lined. it's light weight and feminine, but no camisole is needed. when you take it off the shoulder area feels tight, so you need to be a little gentle but it's gorgeous and you should get it. i'm a 32c and i got a 2."
0,"Low quality denim! They ripped on the inside upper thighs of both legs less than two months after purchase. i've washed them once, and wear them a few times a week, so they're certainly not worn out. i've never had a pair give out even close to this early. i loved the cut of the jeans and the softness, and they hold their shape well after multiple wearings. the color is lighter than pictured. i paid full price (the most i've ever paid for jeans) because i'd heard good things about jean shop quality. even at sale p"
1,"Soft but requires ironing Sporty, comfortable and good option to replace jeans, however material needs to be ironed. i bought these as a nice (dressier) alternative to jeans on my trip to europe but didn't end up wearing them b/c an iron wasn't readily available and the height of my ankle boots made the style look choppy. best to wear these with shoes that don't come above ankle."
0,"Unflattering I purchased the blue with white dots. the shape was awful, but looked like a sack - returned"
0," Tried this on in the red because the pattern is so eye catching and beautiful. i couldn't get it off fast enough. picture this: tight in the best, tight in the hips, extra billowy in the middle. so confused and can't see how this would be flattering on anyone. unless you're planning to repurpose the gorgeous fabric, skip."
1,Nice blouse Really like this blouse but am returning for a larger size. much too tight in the upper arms and somewhat tight in the chest - overall i like it.
0,"Frustrating dress This dress has so much potential but doesn't make it.
i read all the reviews and very few were favorable and still took my chances. fabric color and textures is great but the design is really off.
with the little folds on the shoulder and since the fabric is more on the thick side, all this make it to accumulate the ""extra"" weight on the front of the body and as result ""not flattering"" for the majority of ladies including me
it is a shame since it has may great features, the style: flowy, low"
0," I was in love with the green print, so i ordered this despite the reviews. i wish i'd listened. the fit is incredibly weird--huge at the top but tapering in at the hips. so sad this didn't work."
1,Comfy I love all paige denim. i have the flared which i purchased in july and now the skinny. i got the zara ones last year which are a copy obviously and they are just not the same. the ones last year the paige sierra sold out fast but luckily these are here. i actually like these more because they are more worn looking. you can even wear a pretty top underneath to enhance them.
1,"Better with a belt! The colors of this dress really caught my eye. i was hesitant to try it in the store because they only had a size 4 and i'm normally a size 6. when i tried it on i was pleasantly surprised that the dress fit around my hips. success! but like the other women that commented, there was something funky going on in the midriff area. the dress didn't accentuate my curves. the stylist was available at the store i was at, so she recommended that i belt it to add that extra ""umph"". the belt definitely di"
1,Good just not great. Nice shirt seems well made. good just not a great fit for me.
0,"Terrible fit The quality of the fabric is good, but the fit is horrible. unflattering and strange. definitely a pass."
1,"Sadly, it did not fit me right I loved the design and material of the test, but unfortunately it just did not fit me right. it was tight in the hips and did not have the relaxed look i was hoping for. 
also the pattern did not look good on me. 
unfortunately i had to return."
1,"Busty? wear with a belt I agree with the other reviewer that the green is brighter in person, which was a happy mishap. the 8p makes this look just like depicted on me in terms of proportion, so beware that this borders on too long for petites. my not small chest made me look pregnant, but it fit well regardless. adding a wide belt made this dress look amazing on me and shortens it to a more flattering length. this is a miracle as-is because i'm very short-waisted. keeper!"
0,"Sizing out of proportion I love the pattern (red motif) but the sizing of this dress is way off. the top fit fine but the hip area was so tight when standing with my legs hip-width apart. the only way it looked normal was if i stood with my feet together and thighs touching. i ordered my usual size 10 - for reference i am 5'9"", 170# bra size 34f and 40-41"" hips."
0,"Depends on your figure For fuller busted folks, this top may not work as it's unstructured and results in a tent from the boobs down. it's a shame--i found the gold embellishment beautiful."
1," I'm glad they put up some pix of non-models looking cute in this dress, as it's taken a beating in the reviews! i measure 34(a)-27-35 and have no problems with the size s fit at all. it's drapey but not voluminous, with no pulling at the hips. the ""folded"" detail up at the top does call attention to the shoulders, but not in a bad way. the pleated neckline is cute on a small chest, and the red pattern/palette is awesome. love the length too -- i am 5'4"" & the size s hits me just above the knee."
1,"Gorgeous but tight on muscular arms. I bought this in both the navy (a more saturated blue in person - gorgeous!) and green, but both are going back. it fit everywhere but in the upper arms, even across my chest, and i usually encounter the opposite. i think it might just be the way it's cut across the shoulders that don't allow for much movement. so, while beautiful and so incredibly soft, it has to go back. (if you have slender arms, i think it would be a great fit.)"
0,"Cute but itchy This is a cute item at a good price point, though the lack of lining in cartonnier items drives me batty. unfortunately, the wool is so itchy i could not tolerate it more than a second."
1,Perfect for bump :) I bought this dress to wear to work in my second trimester. the shape is perfect to accommodate a baby bump while still flattering the top. definitely recommend for any pregnant women trying to avoid true maternity clothes!
1,"Love this top! This shirt is so comfortable! the fabric is amazingly soft and it is very well made. i liked the top so well that i bought one in grey and one in blue, and both in different sizes so that the smaller (xs) is a little closer fitting and the larger (s) is more blouse and casual. i had originally purchased both in m (which also looked fine, just larger and even more roomy), but exchanged for the smaller sizes. this is a wonderful casual weekend top to pair with skinny jeans, flats, leather boots, o"
1,"Cute blouse This cute blouse runs a little bit small, particularly for large busted ladies. i found the silk fabric to be less luxurious and more utilitarian. it's still a beautiful blouse. due to sizing issues, mine is going back."
0,"Disappointed Quality was not what you expect from retailer, especially for the price. top is lined but skirt is not. material is tissue paper thin and see thru. there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat, it keeps popping up. however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives. was returned."
1,"Perfect as maternity I read other reviews that there was extra fabric in the stomach area and knew it'd be perfect for me to wear to a wedding at 20 weeks pregnant. and it was! i got tons of compliments. it accented my baby bump perfectly, fitted but not too tight.  the pleats at the top create a nice shape for the bump. very comfortable for an outdoor wedding. my only complaint is that the armholes are rather tight. after pregnancy i will try belting the dress."
1,"Unbelievably soft This has been my go to top for cooler days, so comfortable and soft. i would say it runs tts with a little bit of a lose fit. i am 5'10, 36c and usually wear s and the s fit me well. i could have gone down in size, but liked this to be a bit loser to wear over skinny jeans and leggings."
1,Careful curvy girls!!!! So after ordering this dress and trying it on myself i was able to make sense of the previous reviews. this dress is constructed very oddly. the top seems to have no room for any hips. it is a straight construct so if you are like me that has an hourglass shape but has a pair of hips i would size up. i bought this in a 6p and in all colors. first off the colors/ patterns are amazing in person very adorable. this fit my 34ddd bust without any problems and no problems in torso either. it was reall
1,"Great pants but huge So, i bought these in 31 --my regular size in hei-hei and they were huge. so, now i am not sure if i should go for a 30 or 29? i guess i will try the 30. they are really soft and very cute pants. just the sizing is difficult."
0,"Cute patterns, potato-sack fit I found the dot print in the store and though the pattern was cute, but when i tried it on i just had to wonder - who actually looks good in this style? it fits like a sack, big and puffy in the middle but tapered at the hem. it creates the exact opposite on an hourglass shape. genuinely puzzled that anyone would look good in this style. to bad, i hope they use these cute colors and prints on a style with some waist-definition next time."
0,Disappointed I'm usually a maeve fan. i found this top to look cheap and fit poorly. it is also very thin material and showed everything.
1,"Close to perfect This is one of my favorite new retailer buys. originally got the green for a family holiday party and went back for the sapphire. the cut and design are great. for reference i'm 5'3"", 115lbs and a 34a. the light weight fabric is perfect for so cal winter, but the real winning feature(s) is the detail. so, so cute. only complaint is it wrinkled fairly easily, but i'll deal with that for a cute form-fitting (but not too fitting!) top. ."
0,"Disappointing for the price The cut of this piece is great, the quality of the fabric is terrible. i used it under another layer the first day i wore it and it pilled across the bust. after hand washing in cold water and hanging to dry it shrank in length- so much that i can no longer even wear it. i always happily pay a premium for quality staple wardrobe pieces. this didn't hold up to one wearing, let alone one season. i recommend strongly against it."
1,Cute blouse that runs small The design is very cute. i'm glad i listened to reviews b/c this blouse definitely runs at least 2 sizes small maybe 3. i bought the blue and it's more of a navy blue instead of royal blue. at the sale price and additional 40% off (my daughter is an employee) i didn't mind paying $24 :).
1,"A little off I want to love this dress. the colors and pattern are gorgeous, and i love the hemline. but something seems off in the chest and shoulders area. it almost feels a little slouch-y."
1,"Super soft, great fit These are very soft and fit well. at first i was a bit put off on the stone wash of the fabric; each pair is different. but it adds character and given the color and the soft fabric, it's a nice difference. i love the pockets, they are deep enough for anything you want to put into them. i love good deep pockets and my cell fits nice into my back pocket. take notice makers of woman's pants, there are some of us who *like* deep pockets!

only one negative... i have noticed hei-hei is not sewing"
1,"Size up and you'll love it I was eyeing this one for a while. based on the style and other reviews, i did order one size up. i think it would have been too small [catch on the hips] in my regular size. i do wish it was a little longer, too. the back is fine because it's longer. it's definitely wearable though. i wouldn't recommend it for a work function if you're a bit taller. despite all of that, i really do like dress. it's a new favorite. i ordered the blue --- love the dot pattern. i wore it with brown booties and it"
0,"Didn't look on me the way it looks on the model I saw this dress in the store and absolutely fell in love with the fabric and just had to have it. i ordered it on line in my size and when it arrived, i tried it on (or tried to try it on) and it didn't fit some parts of my bday (mainly in the bust). i ordered the largest size, so there was no where to go from there except to send it back. others here have complained about a strange fit in the tummy area (i.e., too much material). i never got to find out because i really couldn't get the dress"
1,"No fupa for me This dress was built for my body to disguise it's flaws. i did have to size up because i am broad shouldered, busty, with a tummy pooch and no hips. this dress skims along all that mess and makes me look slimmer. received the package today and am wearing it right now, i'm so happy! i ordered size 10, my stats are 5'3"" 145# 36dd."
0, This dress comes with a built in fupa. literally there is extra material at the lower abdomen that sticks out and is very unflattering.
0,"A sad disappointment The first time i wore it, felt wonderful. had it cleaned and then the back end stated pilling. very disappointed with the price and quality. wish i could return for my money back. sad"
1,"Pretty blouse that runs small The breast and arm area is too tight. best to size up two sizes. the blouse runs too small overall. the color is a darker blue than pictures in the photo. it's a pretty blouse, and great quality."
0,"Not for me This is a beautiful dress, but the fit was strange. i have a small waist and larger hips. i generally wear a 0-2 in a fit & flare style, but styles like this i generally wear a 2-4 for my hips. even in a 4 this was catching on my hips and looked kind of dumpy on my top half.

i really think this dress would be great on a frame that had wider shoulders and smaller hips. it really is pretty."
0,"Wanted to love it I saw this dress in the store months ago and never forgot it, so when i saw it on sale i nabbed it online. so sad to see how this dress fits: just right up top, just right along the hem, and then it's a hot, potato-sack-frump mess in the middle. it's a shame because the fabric is beautiful."
0,"Meh As other reviews stated, this dress runs very large. it was a big potatoe sack on me. added to the fact that the green is much brighter than the online photos, it is going back!"
1,"Very pretty! I purchased this blouse in the kelly green the other day and i love it. the color is beautiful and i like how it hangs/flows- especially the sleeves. it's not warm enough to wear by itself when it's really cold but would be beautiful layered with a cardigan in the winter months and by its own when it's warmer. looks great with skinny jeans, flares and just about anything including the right skirt. i'm so happy i purchased this!!"
1,"Cute but tight in hips I am 135 and went with a size zero. it was very cute on but a little tight on my hips when sitting. the fabric is beautiful, and very soft and silky. the length was great, comes to just barely above my knees and is long in the back. great work outfit."
1,"Pattern is excellent, fit is not I ordered the red motif online in my current size 10. the fabric is so beautiful, even prettier than the online photo. the fit is not great on me. it made me look wider at my chest area and almost catches at my hips (i'm sure shapewear would take care of this). the dress looks really good with a jacket or vest but just weird by itself. i agree with the other reviewer who said it was a little short - i'm 5'9"". it looks good standing up but is very short when i sit. there's no real stretch to the"
0,"Going back... I purchased this dress in the green, and while the print and material were lovely, the extra folds in the neckline made the dress look frumpy up top. the billowly bottom made it look like a bag. i am 5ft, 36d and 29"" waist and the size 2 fit, which makes me think this runs large! i'll be returning this dress."
1,"Beautiful I really like this top. bought it in ""purple"" but i would not call it that. it is more maroon or burgundy. color is exactly what it shows in the online photo. really like the green also. crocheted arms are super. i found it ran slightly small, so if you are between sizes, order up. one slight personal problem for me is that there is cashmere in it and i live in florida. even though we do get cooler weather here, i am not sure i will have that much chance to wear it; it will be too warm for me. t"
0,Eek! Do not buy! i used my 15% discount on this. what a waste. my usual sizes range from s to l depending on what brand. i should have gotten a small. i don't think that would've helped. it was so awkward looking. nothing like the model. it made me look as if i had gained 15 pounds. it was waaay longer in the back-like a mullet. the material was really thick. it is more appropriate for fall. i had high hopes for this-to dress up or down. it was just so ridiculous.
1," I absolutely love this sweater, very comfortable and flattering!!! i'm thinking of buying it in another color!!!"
0,"Just a blah top I ordered this since it looked so cute on the model . when i it arrived, i was excited to try it on, but when i did...blah. the color is murky and the top runs large, not to mention that the material is too heavy for a short sleeved top (plus it's lined). i really wanted to like it and debated wetting it and then putting it in the dryer to shrink it a bit. in the end, i decided that it wasn't worth it. too bad, as the concept was a good one. it just failed in the execution."
1,"Beautiful, but runs small in the chest, i guess? I tried on the red xs in the store and the v-neck was way too low. showed at least an inch of my bra strap in the back, which was unfortunate because i really loved the dress otherwise. i decided to purchase the xxs online hoping the v would not be so deep and would cover my bra. it did, but the xxs was significantly smaller! it still fit, but took this from an elegantly flowy and loose dress to one that looked more empire cut and tight in the chest. maybe the xs i tried in the store was just st"
1,Love I love this top it is easy to wear fun and very comfortable. i was thinking about it for weeks and kept coming back to it after i read a review about going up a size i decided to go for it and i am very happy i did!!! my new favorite!!!
1,"Comfortable and classic I got the orange dress and find it super comfortable and flattering. i dress it up with a one-inch taupe belt and taupe wedge shoes. it moves beautifully, i can wear a regular bra and it doesn't show. i got an xs regular and the hemline hits 6"" above my ankles. i'm 5' 3"", 33-26-35 and normally take a size 2 or 0. i'm long waisted, so often a petite will be short-waisted on me. the seam actually comes just below the bust line on me, unlike on the model. on days when i'm a bit bloated, i can wear"
1,"Perfect summer to fall transition piece! I am petite and curvy and was apprehensive about the cropped length of this jumpsuit. however, the petite looks great and the length is perfect. it is light enough weight to keep you cool during the day but provides some coverage for cool evenings. i ordered the xs petite and it was still a little loose. i am 5'3"" and 125lbs. this will be my go to for fall! looks great styled with ankle boots or clogs and will carry me into fall with a chunky sweater!"
0,Weird The way the back came down so much made the top look weird. i do like some tops that hang longer in the back but this one was just too much. also the material was kind of blah it was thick polyester which would not be very cool during the summer and the color looked better in the picture. so to me it was just a over priced odd top.
1,"Yes yes yes I promised myself only one pair of joggers this year, and these were the ones i went with (in the blue motif). for me the tipping point was the quality and fit of these were far superior than the others i tried, while still being machine washable. the fabric has aa little substance, yet is still lightweight and comfortable. the fit has a perfect bit of tailoring/tapering to be ultra-flattering while having the comfort of pajama pants. the blue motif is adorable too - love the geometric shapes. l"
1,Perfect! I can't believe i waited so long to get this. it is truly soft and well fitted. the deails in the sleeves and neck are just great. kuddos again angel of the north!
1,Nice for summer I bought these in both colors. i'm usually an xs or a small and i went with the small for the length. they are a comfy shirt great for the hot summer days.
1," This is super cute. i bought it in the gray and white lace in a size s and it's quite roomy. i probably could have sized down to an xs, but i like the relaxed look. there are a few edges of lace that are not sewn down all the way and i will have to fix them as i can see them start to pull away and eventually unravel but otherwise it's a beautiful and unique top."
0,"Just ok. I found the color to be a bit blah, and the sweater is chunky and is a tad too short for wear it lands. also, because of its ""chunkiness,"" it doesn't tuck in as nicely to a pair of jeans as it appears to on the model."
0," I loved the look of this shirt, but when i put it on it was entirely too billowy under the chest. it just ended up making me look larger and pregnant."
0,"Raglan sleeve style did not work with larger bust I saw the photo of the young woman wearing this dress in the reviews and she looked beautiful, i on the other hand looked awful. the fabric of the entire dress is quite stiff, so the dress didn't move with me; it sort of felt as if i was wearing a paper cut out. then to contribute to the volume, the sleeve is not set in, it is a raglan style, that on me looked more like a bat suit, than what i was hoping for, a beautiful distinctive dress for an important affair. also the belt didn't enhance the"
1,"Love! This dress is so cute and comfortable! it can be dressed up or down, super versatile. love it!"
1," Love this top! has a beautiful shape, and it wasn't too long on my 5'3"" frame. puella always makes items with lovely, soft cotton, and this is no exception! awesome piece for summer!"
1,"Cute and classy I ordered this tank, and was very pleased with the quality. each of the stripe colors has a different knit, adding an unusual and interesting look. it has a trim fit. i wear s and sometimes xs, but this fit perfectly in the s. i agree with the other reviewers that that armholes are the correct size- so nice not to worry about a bra showing in the armholes!"
1," I purchased these pants in blue, they fit great - only problem is that one leg is about 1/2 inch longer than the other. i got them on sale with a discount so i will keep them and take them to a tailor to fix. bummer."
1,"Sweater-like, loose-fitting tank. Beautifully constructed tank--but the bodice isn't fitted and hangs straight down on me--perhaps better for a full-figured individual (i'm 5' 8"", 34b, 120lbs and the xs had no shape on sides). could've been longer too. size of armholes is perfect though (often they gap/show bra)."
0,"Ribbing at neck and sleeve ruins the look for me This dress didn't work for me for several reasons, but i knew i wouldn't keep it as soon as i saw the ribbing on the neck and arms, which makes an otherwise flexibly styled dress (dress up/dress down) into super casual only (plus it looks cheap). it is also not for the long waisted or tall.

on the plus side, the fabric feels great, and it hangs well."
1," Love! adds texture and femininity to a basic sweater. ordered a small so i could layer. if you're busty or between a s and m, you may want to size up."
1,"I love this jumpsuit I love this jumpsuit! i'm 5'3, 122 lbs and the x-s was to big on me. i had to return and order the x-s in petite and the fit was perfect. you can wear it with heels or with slides. i wore it with a thick brown wide belt and some tan open toe shoes. i wore gold earrings and necklace. i got some many compliments and my girl friends asked where i had purchased it. and if. purse i told them retailer;)"
1,"Reminds me of the 1970's I think this is adorable and am so excited to have bought it. it is really flattering. i love how it hangs-- it's loose enough without being unflattering at all. it's a little retro. it feels really soft! i hope it holds up well. 
i'm 5'1 and and 103. i got an xs and it fits perfectly."
1,Never too old Lovely dress!  i&amp;amp;#39;m wearing it with a blue denim jacket and brown suede boots.  it is most certainly purple - a little more so than the picture.  still love it.
1,Love these pants! Beautiful white denim pants. the fit is perfect. fitted on the top with a nice flare on the bottom. very classy and versatile cut. paige denim runs long for me and these are no exception. will be getting them hemmed but i don't mind because they are perfect!
1,"Love how it looks but doesn't hold up I love this shirt, love love love it. i am a curvy girl and it accents all the right features and hides the ones that need to be hidden.
but i've owned it for 6 months and there are already 4 holes in the shirt. and not holes in the fabric but holes on the seam lines. the stitching is not sturdy enough for the shirt to not fall apart. the whole point is to be able to wear it. but now i have to bust out my sewing machine to reinforce the seams that split so that i can wear it again. :("
0," I hoped, from the picture, that this would be more of a ""straight down"" sort of fit. retailer is usually really great at selling tops that flatter hips without having an obvious bell shape to them. however, the top had too much of a ""flare out"" bell-shaped vibe. i need to be able to wear this with maxi skirts in the summer, but this top would be too sack-like and billowy with those. i think it would only work with jeans/trousers. my final objection was the arm holes - the way they are cut,"
0," Mine came smelling like gasoline. not sure why, but i would have kept it otherwise. it's a smell that will be really hard to get out. looks like the picture."
1,"Fun arm detail Really enjoy this pullover's arm detail. i got the ""purple"" which was somewhere between aubergine and garnet. i think this will easily go with black pants to wear to work or a fun skirt/jeans."
1,Perfect summer dress! I had eyed this simple yet stylish dress for awhile but hadn't tried it on yet. i managed to snag the orange version during the tag sale - $40 for maeve?? it is super flattering and will be a wardrobe staple for years.
1," Purchased these in the blue motif. love the hei hei brand. . they run true to size. they are very comfortable and wear well. you can wear them to the office,dress them up or go casual with a tee. versatility and comfort, what more could you ask for."
1," Purchased these in the blue motif. love the hei hei silky pull on pants. i got hooked on them last summer and was thrilled to see them for the upcoming spring. they run true to size. they are beyond comfortable and wear well. everyone should have at least one pair of these comfy pants in their closet. dress them up, down or wear them to the office. versatility and comfort, what more could you ask for."
1,"A pop of color and style Pros:
- fits tts. i tried on a size m and it fit well for my 36c and hourglass frame.
- the cowl neck gives it a nice touch of class.
- love the pop of yellow. not too showy and yet cute and fun.
- fabric has a great feel and stretch to it. forgiving fit. 
- will go with many outfits.
-wore a nude bra and had no see-through issues.
______________
cons:
- does seem a tad delicate, easy to snag due to being a knit, but otherwise solid construction.
- unlined.

1,Substantial! I love this sweatshirt! i truly did not pay much attention to it on line but while in my local store one was returned and it caught my eye immediately as the flowers are embroidered in a nice substantial rope type yarn to give it a more demential effect. the torn holes here and there give the appearance of being the most loved garment in your closet...and it has become mine along with the jacket with the same embroidery...funny how 2 pieces i did not give a second thought about have become my li
0,"Poor quality fabric I purchased this top in the black and tan color, loved the fit, style and fabric. however, it is a loose weave and after just one wearing a hole opened up on the front, which could not be repaired. it was covered by the cowl neck collar but as the day wore on the hole got bagger and it can no longer be hidden. i was very disappointed in the quality of this top- i purchased it at full price and was only able to wear it once. i just didn't have the time to return it to the store."
0,"Abroad dress This is a heavy dress - it's surprising when you lift up the hanger how much it weighs because it looks like a light sundress. and on my frame, which is pretty thin, it hits my shoulders and then my hips and just falls... so the heft of it means there's no waistline... it's an odd fit. the color is gorgeous, but the lack of shape made this a no."
1,"Nice, simple summer dress I ordered this online in red. i would definitely say this color is more of an orange-red. i like the weight and the cut. i keep wishing the material was a soft modal vs what it is. the ribbing up top does not bother me but it definitely does make it a casual dress. (which is what i wanted so i'm happy with it) 

it fits me nicely, the straps (for me) could be a hare shorter to fit perfectly. that being said, i'm 5'5"" and have a thin build. small bust. i would say there is a some leeway for 1 s"
1,"Great dress, very happy, recommended! I was immediately drawn to the ochre yellow color of this dress and it's stitch and pleat details and was happy to score it early enough in the season still in my size and preferred color option. unlike other reviewers, i was not turned off by the ribbing at the neck and arm lines. i received the dress yesterday, am wearing it today, and have already received compliments from even the most sour-faced co-workers who can't give a compliment or share casual conversation in the hallway. the sunny ye"
1,"Can't wait for warm weather to wear this Just bought this today and i love it. so simple, and at the same time it's not. the fabric makes it casual to dress up or down, but the shape of it is incredible and what takes it above simple. the straps felt a little long, so i will likely get it altered to be shortened in the straps. got the red and it's gorgeous."
1,"Great fit - and a win for petites Really like the cut - it's tough for petites to find good joggers and these hit the mark. light, easy, comfy - great with heels for work or sandals on the weekend."
1,Classy cowlneck Absolutely love this sweater! it is a tad bit large. i bought it in a medium but because i like the loose fit i will keep it. it is very light and great for the summer. i've only worn it once so far and received many compliments on it. great quality as well!
1,"It is a crop top This top is very nice, very pretty. i thought the design on the top is more shiny but it is embroidery-like threads. it looks quite nice but is very very short, like a crop top. it came just down to the top of my tummy. i wish it were longer, i would have kept it. but it is a nice top, flattering for curvy figures."
0,"Too billowy I like the color blocking of this top, but it was too large and billowy on the bottom. it felt like a pregnancy top so i had to return it as it gave me no shape."
1," I love these! i adore tracy reese, and these are my favorites. they feel like pjs, fit true to size and are just perfect for work (i'm a teacher) or for going casual. very lightweight and not too hot for texas summers."
1,"Beige and black First things first: these are not black and white as the photos suggest, they are beige and black, which was a disappointment when they arrived. i can still wear white shirts with them, but had they actually been b/w, i think they'd be more versatile in terms of possible shirt colors. that said, they are well-made, and the waistband and pocket detailing is nicely done. i love loose-fitting rayon pants and these are just that (mine fit a little looser than the model's fit). i ordered a small and"
1," These were not tts, imo. i am a 10 and ordered the m. they did not look bad, but b/c these have no stretch, they were not comfy, like joggers are supposed to be. i ordered the lg when they went on sale and while they are baggy, the comfort is spot on in the larger size. i got the navy after seeing the irl pics. happy with this sale purchase !"
0,"This top runs both small and true to size This top has a lot of potential (comfortable, easy to wear) but it's cut too small in the area above the bust. i tried the top in small, medium and large (i usually wear s or m in retailer tops) and couldn't get that area to not look tight or like it was pulling. you can see it on the model, too -- that space right above the bra near the armhole. i think you'd need to order a size up to get that space to work but then the top will start to look too big on the bottom. 
i tried the green in the sto"
1," The neckline is beautiful! it's super soft and comfy. sadly, my normal large looked very boxy. i am hoping the medium will fit better."
0,Comfy but see through These jeans fit well and the stretch makes them comfortable. i can't recommemd them though because they're see through. wish white jeans were better lined so that this isn't usually a problem!
1, I love the muted coloring! this top is generously sized. i have a small bust and it is roomy under the arms. i wish it was less full around the waist area.
0,"Way too big on the bottom I thought this top was so cute but when i tried it on, it is so big on the bottom, it looks like a tent. i normally wear a l or xl and took it back to the store to try on a medium and that one fit better but the bottom was still too big. sad."
0,Great features but too boxy I loved the color of the top and the faded look but unfortunately had to return it because it was too boxy and just looked frumpy
1,Great under dresses These truly are tights and not leggings. they could not be worn alone but definitely great under skirts or dresses. they are thick and warm. i thought they ran a little big.
1,One of the cutest tops i have for this summer! I love this top! it fits perfect and is of great quality! i ordered the pink and love it so much i'm getting the navy one! colors are so trendy as well. this top is so much cuter in person. hard to tell the detail online. definitely recommend to others!
1,"So much fabric... The picture of this top is misleading. it's more like a tent/ super short dress. i ordered my usual size (l) and could easily get away with a small in this top, if the arm holes were not too tight. i def. need to go down to a medium, and maybe even a petite medium since i'm 5/3. the top is 100% cotton, but there is so much fabric there is no way a little shrinkage would offset the amount of extra fabric. it looks like a tent on. plus, the picture and description make it seem like a normal top le"
1,"Online photos don't do this dress justice! I saw this dress in a store the other day. it is so cute in real life. i don't think the pictures online even begin to show how cute it is on. the dress is well-made and it fit perfectly. in fact, it is quite flattering. i am so happy i saw it in the store. even though i am big online shopper i would have passed on this dress if i only saw it online, but don't because it is worth every penny."
0,"I really wanted to love this top! I read the previous reviews and ordered down a size knowing that the shirt runs big.   i really wanted to love the shirt however it was a tent. with all of the extra material in the back, it billowed out in all the wrong places. the material is comfy and it's a very cute concept, just didn't work for me."
1,Cute but not for me Fit is just like stet in my opinion.
1," I had been on a white jeans hunt for some time. pilcro is one of my favorite brands, and i can buy online with confidence knowing they will fit. if petite had been available, that would have been better in length, but it was not so i had them hemmed."
0,"Terrible fabric The good: the sloths are cute because sloths are always cute. 

now the bad: the material is wretched. it feels damp even when it's not... it's see through and unlined... it's scratchy and wrinkly... and though the cut of the dress would be fine, the fabric is so limp that the high-low hem looks more like a tail. 

i wanted to like this, but charging nearly 200 dollars for a see through piece of awful fabric with a passable cut was simple not acceptable. i returned it as fast as i possibly c"
1,"In love!!! I have been stalking these pants since they first showed up on retailer's site. i have never even tried on anything like this before though, so have been waiting patiently for a review to get an idea of what they might look like, fit like...etc sale plus 30% off was incentive to take the plunge without a review though. i am wearing them right now and they are so comfortable and pretty and just...everything summer. perfect!!!! i am not a ""shorts"" person, generally wear skirts and dresses. these are"
1,"Best pair of jeans i have purchased in years. I cannot speak more highly of these jeans! i am a standard size 2, 5'3"" and have never been able to purchase a pair of jeans and wear them right away. i *always* have to hem them by massive amounts. these jeans are so flattering, the wash is amazing. i have worn them with cute ballet flats and tall boots so far, but i think the possibilities are endless. i am petite but in a curvy way and i haven't felt these great in a pair of jeans in so long. the wash is great for dress up/dress down. i have"
1,"Love but a little too much flow I love the details and design of this top- my only issue is the top is a bit too ""flowy""."
1, Seen it online so i ordered it is so cute great fit patchwork is so pretty very vintage looking runs large would be cute with some skinny jeans and some booties
1,"Amazing! This dress is much cuter in person than it looks on the model online. it's so flattering, it fits like a dream, and i love the fabric. i love that the skirt is a true a-line, not poofy, so it's sleek, slimming and flattering. the neckline is feminine and gorgeous and is a bit sexy, while still being classy. oh, and the length, perfection! not too long, not too short. i never ever pay full price and for this dress i had to. i am a curvy size 4 and it fits perfectly true to size. i couldn't be hap"
1,Great top! Saw this in the store but didn't have my size. ordered online- wore it twice already and got so many compliments! very current and flattering!
1,Fun top! I got the blue and love the color. it's bigger than it looks here! almost like the model has it pinned in the back...but it's swingy and super cute and fun!!
1,"Picture doesn't do it justice! This is a super cute top that is a fit and flare design. i think the stylists wanted it to look more straight hence the odd model shots, but this definitely has a flare to it. it also has pockets. it feels a bit artsy to me which isn't normally my style, but the pink and white is just very feminine and pretty. i would say it probably runs a little large because of the style, but i have larger arms, so, the arms were a bit snug in my normal size, but i didn't want to go up in size as the rest fit"
1,Gorgeous dress! I loved this dress when i tried it on. the plaid is darling and the plunge is sexy. i so wish it would work for my body type. the waist came a bit too high on me (almost a line) and it made me look kind of frumpy in the midline.
1,"Well made, long and flowing This elegant-with-a-slight-edge top has a lovely neckline and is very comfortable. i chose the denim/blue version, which i wouldn't wear with jeans, but it's great with crops. i imagine it will be a good layering piece in the fall. it's long, but not long enough to be a dress. overall, it's flattering and slightly structured up top with tiny buttons at the back of the neck?generous and full below."
1,Beautiful dress The stylist at my local retailer recommended i try this dress and it did not disappoint!  the material is fabulous and it looks exactly as pictured on the model.  it also has pockets which is a bonus to me.  i normally wear a 4 but bought a 6 in this dress - i am a 34c and i felt the 4 was a little tight across the chest - otherwise i feel the dress is pretty much true to size.
1,"Sizing is off The bra is comfortable and the design is good. however, the sizing is way off. i am a 34c and the small fits well with minimal support. not sure about quality. this one might have to go back :("
1," Really gorgeous dress...great fabric/weight, great color & style. runs one size small. i ordered my regular 6 but had to return...hope the 8 works!!!"
0,Way too long! This top was supposed to be 23 1/4 inches long in petite. it's actually 28 1/2 inches long.  it's also large in width. hard to believe it's an extra small petite.
1,Beautiful tights These are more than what i had expected! they're beautiful and fit like a glove. i'm thrilled that i purchased them.
1,Love this top I paired this top with pants and cardi from retailer and have really enjoyed wearing this outfit. i usually wear a large but due to how much material there is and how flowy it is i sized down to a m and it fits perfectly. only down side is getting the buttons buttoned behind your neck.
1, Wide fit. usually an 8-10 at retailer. got a large for online order and was large for sure - great for summer or winter with long sleeve and tights
1,"Tights The color is great, a nice alternative to all my black tights. good quality."
1,"Well made and pretty! I bought this in blue and have worn it with jeans, khaki shorts, and camo pedal pushers. added just a perfect amount of feminine detail without being over the top. i'm loving that it shows off my shoulders (they're tan from my vacation and i've been working like a fiend on my arms in the gym). it's well made too!"
1,Lovely plaid halter I live abroad where there is no retailer. so i  rely heavily on reviews.i took the advice from others and ordered a size up.  glad i did because the top portion of the dress runs very small. if you have larger breasts this dress may not work for you. luckily for me..it fits wonderfully..i love the fabric and the fact that it has pockets. it's lined..but not too bulky.its a lovely summer halter where you can show a little skin.
1,"Short top This looks really cute online. i was super excited to get it and i ordered my regular size in maeve. i got a size 0 (i am 5'4, 114#). the top is very pretty and the fabric is nice but it is very short, it didn't even cover my stomach and didn't come to the top of my jeans. i'm sending it back. maeve usually runs big but you can't tell from the photo and the size chart that it's more of a crop top. disappointing since almost every size is sold out."
1,"Elegant and feminine This is really a gorgeous blouse. the design is very feminine and elegant, and fits true to size. i didn't think it ran short and the material is light and airy. it sold out so quickly so i had to wait awhile and managed to get my hands on a 4 when it was available for a quick second. it was def. worth the wait. a gorgeous top."
0,"Disappointed This dress has been in my inbox for a long time and when it went on sale i purchased it right away. i am a size 4 petite in everything retailer and have not had a problem with fit, if anything i might have to size down. i purchased a 4 petite in this dress and i couldn't zip it all the way up. it was as if i was trying to get into a 0 petite.  i don't even think a size 6 would fit. there is something not right with the make of this particular dress i received. even if the fit was perfect i didn't"
0,Too flowy and too washed out This shirt is way too flowy and the pink color is extremely washed out- will definitely be returning!
1,"Just what i was looking for! I needed a summer party dress for a few casual special occasions this summer and this dress fit the bill perfectly. fits tts (5'8"", 160lb - sz 8) and is really flattering. it is quite open in the front but i was able to keep everything situated w/ the right bra. purchased it on sale and am so pleased!"
1,Great jeans for tall ladies These white jeans are super cute. the longer length is perfect for tall ladies who can still roll them up. you can also adjust the height of the cuff since it is not pre-attached to the jeans. i will wear them all the time.
1,"So pretty! I get compliments on this top every single time i wear it. the pattern is so pretty, and while it's very lightweight, it still drapes nicely. i would caution that someone with a larger chest may find that the shape is not quite right - i am a 34d and just on the cusp of having it be too balloon-y on top."
1,"Mavis patchwork buttondown The prints are subtle, the fabric is soft, and the mismatched buttons are cute. unfortunately, even in an xs, it was huge all over. i love flowy shirts and swing styles, but this just stuck way out from my body and was unflattering."
1," Super cute! got a marilyn vibe that i like. although i can tie the halter to make the chest area tighter, i will have to get a tailor to adjust the chest area and under the arms a bit."
1,"Good fit and great style This is just the cutest dress on. i love the way the plaid comes together in the seams and the fullness of the skirt. i almost didn't order it, but then i left something in my cart too long and it was gone. this was my next choice. i haven't had the chance to wear it yet. but the wrinkles pressed out beautifully and it is hanging in my closet waiting for an event. i will wear it without a bra since even with my strapless, the bra shows in the front. i think if you want to wear a bra it would be"
1,Sweet briar tank The color is great. the fit is accurate and it is a great transitional piece.
1,Love! This top is perfect!! i am small chested and it actually makes me look like i have a chest! plus for me!! it's also great for work and casual.
1,"Almost Beautiful top, the silk was good quality, not thin. ordered a 6 because it was selling out so quickly, wished i could have ordered the 4. will definitely try if they come back in stock."
1,"Cute tank, great details This tank is great - goes well with black pants of skirt. it's a nice texture that doesn't show too many wrinkles so will travel well. it's a bit hard to get the buttons done in the back of the neck, but i assume that will get easier with time."
1,"Recommend with one comment I usually wear a medium but in this top probably could have pulled off a small however i was afraid the neck would be too tight.  was considering the small because the arm holes were a bit baggier than i would like.  no issue with my bra showing though.  i wasn't able to try on the small to test my theory since i purchased online.  overall i love the color (blue), the fabric is comfortable, definitely loose but i'm okay with that on a hot sunny day."
1, Love this dress but wish the lining was full length - will be removing this liner and using a different slip underneath!
1,"Large on bottom Another lovely, billowy top. i tried on the xsp and the bottom was just huge. and i have a huge bottom - haha! it flowed out so far in the back that it looked silly. it's too bad, because from the waist up, it looks great!"
1," Cutest dress i own. very flattering, makes your waist look tiny."
1,"Cute, slightly uncomfortable I am keeping these because the style is just cute as a button! ;) the button details on the ankle are so adorable. i would normally wear a size small but like the other reviews said they run small - i purchased the ml and they fit great. i wore them all day to work and they are slightly itchy....and during the day they would fall down and i would have to keep pulling them up. reminded me of when i was a little girl and my mom made me wear tights. however....they are too cute to not have. i will"
1,"Super cool! Love the luxury feel, so soft. perfect for day out. i'm 5'6 and the fit is just right. not too long or short. dalls right at the shoulders too."
1,"Great spring staple I purchased this dress in blue and paired it with the seychelles forward platform wedges in cognac. the fit is amazing, the length is great (i'm 5'5"" and it hits me a couple inches above the knee), and it is a great spring staple. my only issue with this dress is that is wrinkles so easily. easily fixed with a quick steam or low iron."
1," This bra is so soft and comfortable i feel like i'm not wearing a bra at all, except i have the gentle support i need. the material is very thin and the pink color is see through, so not recommended under a white or see through shirt. perfect for sleeping or lounging in!"
1,"Unexpectedly wonderful So, i really like the plaid designs by siyu. i saw these pants and questioned whether they would be tight and scratchy and ill fitting, but they were so cute, i had to find out. i'm really glad i did. the wool is soft and actually a little stretchy. it has an elastic waist, which is a plus, because sometimes, even if the legs fit, the waist is too small, or vice versa. i am a large, and very curvy on the bottom, and these are perfect and flattering, and the elastic waist is just right. as on the"
1,Fun These pants are so fun! i use them to sleep in as they are see through. i had to size up as the waist band gave me muffin top. i normally wear a small and ended up getting the large.
0,"Runs large This is a nice dress made with high quality fabric. unfortunately i'll need to make a return as it was quite big. i bought this dress in an xs and it was too large all around. i am about 5'3"" and 112 lbs and would have taken the petite, but there were none available. i'm not sure the petite would have even been small enough. the dress was a bit too long for short ladies and definitely too large in the waist and the bust (i'm small on top). it's too bad a this was a cute, and versatile dress that"
1,"Awesome casual dress I loved this dress immediately. it is soft to the touch and super comfortable. i will be wearing this so much this summer! the arms are true to size and the body is flowy and roomy, but it is still flattering! highly recommend!"
1,"So cute This top is truly adorable. it runs a little shorter so better with higher waisted pants. the bow is nice. it did come with the folded pleats showing. we'll see if they come out when i iron? i ordered 0 and am 5'1.5"" and 115 lbs. the top is structured and zips all the way in the back."
1,"Cute ! These are very fun and breezy pants. i first ordered a medium, but the waist was too low. i exchanged for a large and i love the fit now. i like them loose and airy. for reference i am usually a 10-12 petite and the l regular is super cute ;0) i hope they wash well. they are perfect for the hot and humid northern va summer."
1,Versatile Versatile and comfy. can be worn with shirts underneath for multi-seasonal wear.
1,"Love the fit...the color runs! run washer 2nd time I love the relaxed flattering fit of these pants but the navy die runs..a lot. the first time i washed them t did so per instructions on the label. i did my next load of laundry and everything turned blue/ grey! i tried washing them again with vinegar to set the color and hopefully that will help. lots of color running still though, so to be safe wash and then run washer with nothing in it to clean it before doing more laundry. i'm keeping them because i like the pants, but wanted to let you kno"
1,Comfy cute! Love the material and how the back is longer than the front! adds style!
1, Great purchase. true to size. so flattering. love it simplicity.. buy it if you enjoy compliments!
1,"Too cute! I agree with another reviewer who said to get these while you can. the fish print is adorable! and you can't beat the style and uniqueness for this price. i am 5'6"", 145 lbs with long legs and a thicker waist. normally wear size 8 in pants and purchased these in size small. i would definitely recommend sizing down. the mediums fit me ok but the small was more flattering overall while still being roomy and having lots of flow. can't wait to wear these!!"
1,"Flattering & versatile Love this product; got them in the coral and they are comfortable, easy, flattering & versatile.
dressed up or down, they always look good, they hang beautifully, and their ease & comfort make them my go to staple in this southern heat!"
1,"So cute I admit i have a soft spot for a most anything from maeve. this dress is no exception. i had overlooked it online due to the white shirt they show with it online. but the material, design tex are great. the colors are very me and i can see this being a great fall, winter and early spring dress. the material is very soft ( i have sensitive skin) and i love the little pop of color that the front piece adds. the only draw back for me is the lack of pockets and it runs big. i got this on sale so siz"
1,"So comfortable Great style and cut, love the deep v. the fabric is soft and its very comfortable. it gives some support. i don't wear it with light blouses or shirts, unless i'm hanging around the house. i have this is pink and black."
0,"Pretty dress but cheap fabric This dress fit me like a glove and it's very pretty on, but the fabric looks and feels very cheap in person. it didn't look like a dress i spent this much money on. the lining is a very silky thick polyester that doesn't seem like it would be comfortable in any sort of heat. the lace overlay has this strange fusing kind of material between the pattern that looks so cheap. i love the idea of this dress, but it just isn't worth the money (in my opinion) so i returned it."
1,Love!! want more colors! This dress is perfection and i bought the blue one. please make this in black or other dark colors.
1,"Gorgeous! This sweater is beautiful!
the lace is gorgeous and the sweater is soft and cozy.....rare to find a top that is stunning and comfortable at the same time!
the lace is very high quality, and enhances the sweater in a very sophisticated way.....adding that little something special.
the color keeps the overall look elegant and appropriate for any age.
runs true to size."
0,Sheer lab coat I purchased the sand color (beige/) one size up from my usual xs to allow for extra room around the hips. the dress fit a little large so the extra room wasn't necessary. the fabric was much thinner than i expected for the price point. the dress was sheer and on my lighter skin tone looked more like a lab coat than a dress. this may be stunning on someone a bit taller. at 5'4 it just hung on my frame and didn't do much for me. the pockets are a nice touch but overall the cut was unflattering and
0,Revealing This blouse is so cute...casual but still stylish. the problem was that is is a little short for someone with a long torso and it is almost too revealing...the v is so plunging you would have to either pin it our wear a cami. the beads on the ties on the sleeves are also rather heavy and they swing and roll around on your arm...maybe wouldn't bother some but it was a return for me.
1,"Love it! So comfortable! i wore it during my last airline travel day, and a complete stranger complimented me on it."
1,"So soft ! I love this jess. i got it in the blue gray color, and i think it's going to be great for spring and will work into summer as well. cloth and stone is always one of my favorite brands and this dress is so soft. i'm thinking that i'm going to belt it to give it some more shape but i like how it looks unbelted as well"
1,"Great summer dress or shirt This shirt dress will make a great piece for the summer to throw on. the length is perfect for either a dress or throw on some tights as a shirt. i bought the beige color one and it's a little see through. would def need to wear a slip on.

i am 5'8 120 pounds and the xs fit perfectly."
1,"My birthday dress! I saw this dress in the retailer store and fell in love with it. tried it on, and even though i was wearing jeans and desert boots, the dress looked terrific! it's great, can obviously be dressed up or down, a wonderful addition to my wardrobe! thanks retailer!"
1,"Love these pants but they run large! Since these are high waist pants, i think the size given is more for a lower waist measurement where most pants these days typically sit. i'm 5'10"", 150 lbs and ordered a size 31 but it was much too large. i love the style of these pants a lot. they look great if you have long legs, the size 31 ran about 5"" above my ankle, higher than is shown in the photos but it looks great."
1,"Unique This sweater is very comfortable and soft. unlike other reviewer, i did not find the lace to be itchy. i'm 5'4"", usually size 6; decided to order medium to give it a nice and relaxing feel. this way i find it to be not too short nor fitted. it's easy and relaxing but the lace makes it a little more dressy. not sure how it's going to handle the wash."
1,"Such a fun,casual and comfy item I bought this in a medium at the store (usually a size 8 -10) and bought one for my daughter who was with me ,in the coral color. (she's 7 months pregnant , and bought her a small. it fits fine below the belly. she loves how comfy it is.) my other daughter saw them and i had to buy her a pair as well. :>) so, we were hanging out at the hotel on a girls weekend and wore them at the pool and even to sleep in. i think you can actually dress it up and wear it out and about as well. i did see that a"
1,"Perfect for the beach or pool I ordered these in the pinkish color, and i love them! i'm 5'8"" 140 lbs. and the size small fits perfectly. they are definitely sheer, but they're advertised as a cover-up so that was expected. these will be super cute paired with a bathing suit top - bikini, bandeau, or even tankini. the price is great, especially for the type of pant and detailing with the pom poms. no pockets is the only negative."
1," I get more compliments on the stress. it is perfect for work, perfect for summer night concert, perfect date night. love this dress!"
1,Adorable Loved these beach pants! i purchased the size medium in the coral. i loved the accents on the ties and the little pom pom details. i did get many compliments on them. the only thing i don't love about them is the material is very thin. i know they are beach pants but i personally would have liked slightly more weight to them. i wore them once with a pair of cropped leggings underneath and i thought it was a very cute way to wear them with some additional substance underneath.
0,"Fabric is very thin This is more of a sleep shirt. the fabric is too thin and see through. a camisole would not look good under it.
will be returning it."
1,"Easy to wear I tried this on in the store, but almost didn't because i thought it would look like a sack. the dress looks so good. it fits nicely in the shoulders which gives structure and then the rest of the dress is roomy, but no so much it looks stupid. im 5'5"" and it hit above my knees by an inch or two."
1,"Super cute pants! These are adorable pants!!! i ordered them in both colors because i couldn't decide which was cuter. they are light and airy, but not see through. they will be perfect to use as a swim coverup, pajamas, dress them up, anything. very comfortable and versatile! i am a size 8 and ordered a medium and they fit perfect. the elastic doesn't pinch, but probably would have if i would have went with a small."
1," Super soft, light fabric. this dress is perfect for work or the weekends. this brand is new to me but i'll definitely be checking out their stuff more in the future."
1,"Cute, flattering top It's navy and red--the photo looked black to me. so i couldn't use with black skirt that i had planned to pair it with, but it's cute with jeans and maybe white shorts next summer. the front gapes open when you sit down, so i'll either have to pin it or sew a snap there unless i want the world to see my bra. also a little short waited for me--i'm 5""11"", so i wish the wrap hit a little lower, but not enough that i didn't keep it. it is flattering blouse. the shoulder ties add a little extra flair"
0,"Disappointing fabric The fabric wrinkles so easily and any slight moisture or liquid immediately turns into a dark spot on the blue grey...condensation drips from a glass, gel deodorant, etc. i tried the cream but it's very sheer. i had to return this dress-- not practical!"
0,"Loved but... horrible quality I loved this shirt when it first arrived and i couldn't wait to wear it. after one day of wear, i went to hang the shirt back up and it was ripping on both sides of the middle back seem. this shirt was not tight on me at all. very disappointed."
1,"Even cute belted! Love the soft fabric and easy fit of this dress. i'm pleased that it does give a hint of one's figure and doesn't just hang like a sack. i found the blue to be most flattering and was playing with styling at home and found that the wider retailer ""tabby"" leather belt gave it a whole new look."
1,"Perfect for traveling So cute, great for over a swim suit or walking around town. got these on sale. xxs fit perfectly! fabric is very soft, pom poms add fun styling."
1," I went into the store to buy this in white after seeing it on the website. i ended up with the blue/gray color. the white was completely see thru. could have worked as a swim cover- but not at this price for me. the blue on the other hand is fine. the fabric is soft and hangs nicely. you can definitely dress it up with some booties and a belt, or keep it laid back with flip flops. i'm sure i'll wear this a bunch this summer. the color is versatile enough that i will pair with leggings and boots"
1,Cute design The dress has some cute features. the little belt motif hits too high on me and the drop waist is a little awkward. but it is comfortable and looks best with some kind of shirt worn underneath
1," I looooove these. the styling makes me wonder if i could even wear them to work on casual fridays with the right top they are so great. i am a little concerned about how they will hold up over time since some of the stitching looks a little shoddy, but they are still worth it at this price. i am going to order another pair just in case they don't hold up, i love them that much."
1,Cute Cute top. not sure about the tassels at the sleeves. very flattering in the waist area.
1,Light and breezie soft to touch This product is the best if not the most excellent garment i have purchased in years i feel like a model even though i am full body lady what gorgeous piece of clothing
0,"Disappointed I was so in love with these when i saw them online. they arrived today, and while the fit was great, i was disappointed. the colors are definitely more drab in person than what's pictured in the photo. the material is very thick. it's soft and they'd be warm in cold weather, i'm sure. i liked them, but they were underwhelming. if they were less expensive, i would probably keep them because i liked the fit and they'd be a quirky alternative to what i usually wear to work, but sadly, back they go."
1,Comfy These are very comfy and can be worn casual or dressed up. love the pom poms.
0,Cute dress...akward fit Cute dress...but akward fit. sleeves are a bit sung but the rest of the dress is a little large for its size.
1,"Maybe.... I'm still on the fence about these. i realize they got great reviews but i thought they would be a bit thicker. they just feel too flimsy and too much like i'm ready for bed. i was looking for more lounge pants that i felt like if i needed to run up to the store on a saturday afternoon that i wasn't wearing pjs. i just can't get past that. they are totally cute but i was definitely looking for more summer lounge-wear.

i ordered the small which fit fine. i wear 4-6 in retailer pants. i got the p"
0,All wrong I thought it would be heavier than it is. it's thin and more delicate than what i would expect for a winter sweater (it contains wool so not really suitable for spring/summer). it's also shorter than it appears on the model and a little wider/boxier too.
1,"So cute! These are *almost* perfect. the fabric feels great, and it's a super cute print. the only downside is that the rise is really long and high. i wish they'd stocked more petities, because the petites are all sold out, and only the super long regulars are left at this time. if you are above 5'7"", they'll be awesome on you. if you are below 5'4"", you may be getting them altered."
1,"Love the dress but it doesn't love me! I'm a maeve fan and i really like the design, fabric and details of this dress. unfortunately, the skirt flares out too much and ends in an odd area on my legs. i'm not sure why the silhouette doesn't drape on me as it does on the model. it's like a cut-off a-line flare. have to agree that this dress runs large. i usually wear a m, ordered the s and it's still too big."
0,"Ribbed lace hem pullover The front and back of this square sweater are the same, and the pattern of the stitching makes it look like it's on backwards.the lace would be nice, but it's itchy. and the sweater is cropped, so i think the layered lace look is odd because the whole thing is so short on the body. the 3/4 sleeves make it look small and fitted, but the body shape is bulky. just couldn't get it to work."
0,"Great in theory 1. the wide leg/crop is a cool trend. but not great on me. i'm pretty standard in size/build: 5'6"", 135 lbs,, size 4. i felt like i just looked oddly shaped with them on.
2. and maybe this is the issue: the size 27 (my normal size in every citizen pant i own) was about 2 whole sizes too big for me. i mean, i felt great about myself. but...wowza.
3. when i took them to the store to try on/exchange, they don't even carry them in the store! so i just returned and will try something else."
1,"So cute! These are not only comfortable, but so cute. they are something you don't see on everyone else, and people always comment. i get so many compliments or inquiries every time i have them on. the materiel is lightweight and flowing. i love these casual, beautiful beach pants. i got a small, my usual size and they fit great. 5'3'"", 130 lb.s. i wear tee shirts, bathing tops, coobies, any kind of top looks swell. get them while you can. i got the peach and black color."
0,"Very thin The fabric is very thin. i have seen this comment on several sundry reviews, but its hard to imagine how thin the fabric is until you see it in person. i could put a cami under it - but it was also rather short on me. i don't usually have trouble with shirts running short and can even sometimes wear petite sizes since i am only 5'4""."
0,"Did not love the fabric... I have a dress very like this from retailer's fall line.  i love it, so i decided to try this one. the fabric is thinner than the other dress, which is good for spring, but it also seemed not such a great quality. i also didn't care for the texture. if this doesn't bother you, the pattern is very cute and the style is flattering. it is cute with a blazer."
1,Comfy cute. I just got this dress in the beige color and i absolutely love it. the fit is perfect and i feel that it is just the right length. i got a small and i am 5'9''. the pockets are a great touch and really are the key for tunic style dresses for me. i love the soft material and could live in this dress. such a great staple for my closet!
1,Go to going out tank I buy everything that retailer sells in chambray. this top did not disappoint. it is so comfortable and the back the way it is slightly lower than normal is very sexy without being revealing. the straps fall off of your shoulders a bit but i do not find it annoying. i am not big busted so i didn't have the sizing issue that others seemed to have.
1,Beautiful This is a very flattering top and the details are spectacular. it is very comfortable to wear and the the appliqu茫漏s and embroidery make this very slimming. as the other reviews noted the side slits go up quite high. i won't be raising my arms much wearing this. the small rhinestones in the center of the black flowers go around the entire sleeve and they catch on the rest of the shirt sometimes. i have to be aware of it and more careful not to make very fast movements until i'm sure i'm not tangl
1,Gorgeous This was an impulse purchase for me. a year ago i would have never considered a jumpsuit but they are growing on me. i had yet to find one that fit without too much need for tailoring. this one did the trick! i like that the cut is in such a way that you can wear a normal bra underneath it without it showing. the fabric itself is very lightweight so i would recommend a bra for some support. i like that the fabric is incredibly lightweight so you can wear it on a hot summer day. the jumpsuit is l
0,"Paper thin Great print, terrible quality. the material is paper thin. not at all what i look for in a robe. it's going back."
0,I was really disappointed I was really hoping this dress would work because it looks adorable on the model. i ordered my usual size 0 but when i put it on the cross part in the front was way too high on my neck and was super uncomfortable. i also had a lot of room in the back of the dress so it wasn't as form fitting as i would have liked. i ended up returning this dress.
1,Love the ruffle detail This is not your basic white tee. the ruffle and seam down the front add visual interest. cute alone or paired with a sweater and statement necklace.
1,Beautiful vest! I got this vest on sale in the navy color and love it! the quality of the fabric is great and the draped design of it is so chic! really adds a stylish touch to almost any outfit.
1," I was looking for a dressy shirt i could wear more than a few times. i have a reunion tomorrow that i wanted to wear this to. i went into a store and saw this, i immediately thought this was the perfect shirt. i saw the price tag, and decided not to get it. i looked several other places and i kept coming back to this shirt. i think if it wasn't displayed in the store, i wouldn't have wanted it so much. it is so much more beautiful in real life. the photo doesn't do it justice. i ended up orderin"
1," This vest is much silkier than the pictures online show, which was a great surprise. the cut of this vest is beautiful and it can be worn so many ways!"
1,"Gorgeous details! This shirt is amazing! the soft fabric, detailed embroidery, and gorgeous little beads/sequins..all fabulous quality and make this piece worth the price. i love the length and cut of this too - not boxy, yet not too tight or fitted; just covers my bum. can be dressed up or down."
1,"The best ""instant upgrade"" vest This vest is awesome. it can take any dress/outfit and instantly make it more fancy and formal. the way it drapes is very forgiving and the back bow can be modified and switched out for different colors depending on outfit color. ."
1,"Bravo! I hope you can get this top.this is a great classic,that will be in my closet for a long time."
1,"Unique top This top is beautifully detailed , it is flattering and i am very happy with my purchase!"
1,"Classic, modern, aesthetically-pleasing piece I picked this up at my nearest retailer this afternoon after placing my order a few days ago. i purchased the off-white version in size small. i actually tried this on in the dressing room to make sure i was satisfied with the product. when i came out, i asked the retailer customer service rep if she could cut the tag off so that i could wear it out today. she not only helped me out but also commented on how much she liked this sweater while also wondering why she hasn't seen it in store; i informed"
1,Perfect jumpsuit I found this jumpsuit at my local retailer it must have been a web order return i love it the fit is true size the colors are perfect it's very comfortable and gorgeous on and at the sale price i could not pass it up
1,Beautiful dress This dress is really stunning - can be dressed up or down with a jean jacket really easily. runs quite a bit small in the bust (i ordered a 16 to accommodate) but it is really very pretty. i love this brand- they always have such lovely pieces.
1,"Beautiful color and style I'm a big fan of left of center as a brand, and this top is definitely a winner!  the deep green is gorgeous and looks fantastic with denim. the shirt is true to size and is flatteringly loose without looking too tent-like. highly recommend!"
1,"Beautiful! careful with the sizing though This dress is gorgeous! i absolutely love the embroidery. a note about the sizing- while the top portion fits snugly, the hip section runs slightly big. i was surprised to find that the 4 i ordered looked baggy, so i went into the store to try a 2, but the 0 was the best fit! however i'm small-chested (and 5'6"" 113lbs), so i was able to go with the 0 as it fit the hips much better. if you're a bustier type though, the top may be tight. other than the tricky sizing, it's perfect."
0,"Runs very small Purchased this dress to wear to new orleans in may...perfect with sandals for casual and dinner. so sad that it was not as i had hoped. the fabric is a bit heavy, and the sleeves are very tight (i have thin arms). the color is a bit ""off,"" as the background color is a gray, which doesn't flatter the yellow design. i purchased the large, as this size usually fits me with a bit of flow, but it was very tight all around, especially around the bust area. going to have to return this..."
1,"Elegant modern I bought this vest to add more versatility to my wardrobe. i love it! i got it in navy, and since it is one color, it goes with a lot of different things - tanks, long sleeves, short sleeves, pants/skirts, etc. i like the bow in the back and the vest makes a plain outfit look much more elegant and exciting! the vest itself is a little longer than i would have liked."
1,"Lovely Makes me feel like a sexy ice skater. true to size, i am 5'0 and 120 lb and both the small and medium fit. i kept the medium. love it!"
1," This top is so beautiful! looks even better in person. i was hesitant because of the price, but i am so happy i bit the bullet and ordered. i am a 36c and the bust is slightly snug."
1," I love the design of this blouse. lots of pretty details. the slits on the side are high, but with a tank underneath, it's perfect. love the length of the sleeves and the modest, flattering neckline. the only problems so far are that the rhinestones are prone to falling out and snagging other parts of the top, so you have to be careful with movements and you can't wear a sweater with it because the rhinestones would snag it a lot. even if it loses the rhinestones, it's still a beautiful blouse,"
1,Just enough bling! Bought this dress for an indian wedding- it was perfect!
1,"Absolutely gorgeous top This top is beauitiful. gorgeous detailing with the eyelet lace, black flower appliqu茫漏s, silver beads and tiny rose gold sequins down the front. true to size. i'm 5'2"", 130 lbs, 34b and took my usual size 4. the slits do come up a bit far on the sides like another reviewer noted but not really enough to be a problem. i didn't find it necessary to get the petite size in this top. i was going to wait until further markdown since the top is still pricey even with a 20% discount but couldn't resist"
1,"Retailer from the days of yore and yesteryear Like other reviewers, when i saw this top in person i was struck by it. i would never have even looked twice at it online. i hardly ever buy things at full price from retailer but i treated myself to this one. the only thing i'd disagree with is that it runs true to size. at my store, there was only 1 left (in a size 10). i'm usually a 4/6 but i figured i'd try it on since the style is loose anyway. and the 10 fit very nicely. i did try a 6 in another store and found the slits came too high and th"
1,"Gorgeous detail The top is just as shown in the picture and it is tts. lots of detailing with beads and lace. i'm 5'1, 92lbs and purchased a petite 00. just as the other reviewers noted, the side slits do come high. high waisted jeans or leggings works perfectly."
1," Absolutely gorgeous top! i have purchased so many retailer tops and this is the 1st review i have ever written. this top is just that deserving for a review. stunning in so many ways. i am 5' 2"", 118 lbs and purchased a size 4. fits perfectly. maybe runs a tad small. can not wait to wear!"
1,"A perfect 10 ! I have looked at this dress a dozen times online and passed. after reading other reviews felt compelled to see why everyone is in love with this dress. when i opened the box i was blown away. this dress is so beautiful and the crystals, which look like sequence online are high quality, as is the fabric and craftsmanship.
a perfect 10!!!!!!!!!!!!
you must have this dress in your closet!!!!!!!
ordered my usual size and fits perfect."
1,Tunic I loved the look of this tunic. it is made well and very pretty. it was so big and heavy i had to return it. i think the small in this would be too big.
1,Georgeous sweater This sweater is very pretty. i had my concerns being that i don't normally pay $300.00 for a sweater but i found the material to be extremely high quality and the details really make it a beautiful piece. i literally got a little tired of people telling me all day how pretty it was. this is definitely a piece of clothing i will cherish for years to come.
1,"Love it! I saw this vest the week it came in the store. i was hesitant, thinking, ""what do i have to go with this?"" i left the store and had to go back and purchase it. i'm so happy i did! it really does go well simple tops (dressy or casual). it is also perfect for the ""winter white"" trend happening this year!"
1,Simple little wow piece This skirt is amazing! it has the right amount of sparkle and the right amount of shape. i bought this in a size six which i can really switch between 6 and 8 depending but the six fits perfectly. i also bought the regular length even though i could probably be considered petite but it ended up being perfect. but the skirt is so lovely in person and has just enough wow that you can wear this thing with a simple tee and still look amazing. i wore this to a party with a black high neck tank and re
1,"Interesting This dress is unusual. it can be dressed up with wedges and dressed down with cool sneakers. if you have any under arm excess fat it will show...but you can hide it with a cropped cardigan. i am 5' 1"", 105 pounds, lean athletic frame with a 32b bust and it fit well and snug.i bought an xxs. i am relatively lean under the under arm but this dress does show any flaw in this area and it does not look good. minus point. super cute and made well. i wear it with a cardigan."
1,"Needs pockets! runs large Even though this is an online exclusive, i was able to try on a one off in the store. i have been looking for a cross front dress and the other option currently at retailer (the black and white striped top version) in a similar length) looked awkward. this dress looks great on but i needed the xs. i usually wear a 2. it was cute and i came online to see if the xs was available but it is sold out. the dress would be perfect if it had pockets!"
0,"Great design but execution is meh..... I loved the look of this shirt but full price was a little steep so i waited for it to go on sale and am glad i waited because only a l was left and it was perfect fit since i originally was thinkng of getting a small or medium which i usually do at retailer but this one was running really small compared to retailer other shirts. the fabric is great but when i looked at it carefully, the zipper construction is sewn poorly as well as the sewing at the buttons area...also, there were a lot of thread h"

1,"Wearing this to my reunion! I had been to the retailer store several times in hopes in finding the perfect top for my upcoming reunion. as soon as i saw this, i knew it was perfect for the occasion. i'm sure i'll get a lot of use out of this top as you can dress it up or down."
1,Beautiful dress! The details and colors are exquisite. stop hesitating and get this dress
1,"Gorgeous top despite some flaws I saw this top online, but i didn't fall in love with it until i tried it on in the store. the retailer salesperson told me that she owned this top and that she always received many compliments when wearing it, but she also warned me that the rhinestones on the sleeves were a problem as they kept getting snagged in the fabric on the body. i decided to purchase the top in the end because it is so beautiful and one of a kind, but i ended up removing all of the rhinestones on the sleeves and i haven'"

1,Beautiful top Very intricate detail with stitching. love the contrast of black on cream. has slits on each side. bought it for holiday parties! just what i had hoped it would be.
1,"Haven't worn yet but ... Just, you know, in front of my mirror and around the house. i bought this piece because i found it to be a bit funky - so you can wear it with jeans for a night out - yet with classic elements so it could be worn to work with a skirt. also, i live in florida, where it is hot hot hot, but i still like to layer my look. it has an excellent weight to it without being to heavy, so it flows well and can be worn even on the warm days instead of a suit jacket. 

i am usually between a small and mediu"
1,"A true beauty Such a gorgeous top, the detail and fit are amazing. however, after wearing the top for about 8 hours, 7 of the center rinestones fell off. the beads on the sleeves also snagged the embroidery where the sleeve touches the body. but, i love the top so much, i exchanged it for another and hoping i have better luck with quality this time around."

1," Beautiful piece that i loved from the day i received it in the mail. lots of compliments, just a fun, pretty outfit."
1,"In love! The details on this top are absolutely gorgeous, from the lace, to the sequins, to the rhinestones! that said, the details are not overpowering, yet more subtle. can't wait to wear this over the holiday season. sure to get tons of compliments!!"
1,"Amazing and surprisingly tts I think of tracy reese as running small, and usually size up, but the 8 was the only size left so i grabbed it and it fits perfectly. i got a million compliments on it and got rid of my other jumpsuits because this one is perfection. please note that if you are busty it will show cleavage, so you need the right bra."
1,"Super cute and comfy I love this t-shirt - the moss green color is just what i wanted, cute fit and true to size. purchased the medium b/c i like t-shirts to be a little loose."
1,"Impressive dress I was quite surprised to find the background color of this dress was grey,not the stone/linen that i was expecting. it still works beautifully against the citrus. fits true to size; the 3/4 sleeves are slightly narrow around the forearm but not tight. i'm 5'4, fairly slim, 132 and i'm in the process of exchanging the petite m for a regular medium as it was just a bit too short for me. i'm very short waisted/long legs, so the straight design is perfect for eliminating the issue. i also found no p"
1,Gorgeous detail This shirt is gorgeous. i bought it for my engagement party and got lots of compliments. the only thing negative was that the particular shirt i bought had one of the stones on the sleeve that the prongs were bent so it snagged the beautiful embroidery on the front of the shirt.. of course my local retailer exchanged it for a perfect new one without hassle. it's an expensive shirt but perfect for a special occasion.
1,"Exquisite top! Saw this in the store, looked at the price tag and decided to wait for a sale. got it this weekend with the 20% off and love it! (thanks retailer) wore it for my birthday dinner and received a ton of compliments. as someone else noted, it does catch on itself so take care when wearing. also, the slits on the side are semi-high but as my husband noted, this makes it a touch sexy instead of just a tunic. i went with an 8 for this reason(you could also wear a tank underneath). and yes, even on sale,"
1,Love this! I was so excited to receive this in the mail. it fits true to size and is extremely flattering. so glad that i made this purchase
1,"Instant style I love the weight and drape of this vest; it adds a finished touch to even the simplest t shirts. i plan on wearing it into the cooler months of fall. however, it runs a week bit small across the bust. i normally wear a medium at retailer but large would have been a better fit. sadly the large vest in the dark blue was sold out."
1,"Light for the south Weather changes during a day to extremes in nela. lightweight cardigan for when little is needed that's pretty and practical, if you take a close look at photo you will see the weave is open, so could snag. nothing hidden. it is what it is-pretty, lacy, feminine."
1,"Unique cut and print, whisper soft I give this sweater a five star review. i am always thrilled to be able to add a cardigan or caccoon sweater that is a color that is different than black or white.this pairs beautifully with so many of the shells and sleeveless shirts that i have from retailer.yes this sweater is extremely delicate, it didn't pull at all while i was trying it on. this will be a great transition sweater."
1,"Retailer amazing I received this top by mail yesterday and opened it this morning. all i can say is wow. it's gorgeous. the detailing is stunning, classic retailer amazing. a true standout piece. can't wait to wear."
1,"Think accessory I ordered size medium. the fit is true to size. the color and pattern work beautifully with the delicate yarns and design of this sweater. as other reviewers have stated, it is very thin and lightweight. in my opinion, it serves more as an accessory rather than it being functional as a cardigan worn for warmth. when i tried it on, i considered whether it would provide any warmth at all...summertime air conditioning, etc. the answer is no... if i decide to keep it, it will be for its aesthetic..."
1,"Strange sizing, but fabulous color The fit is a bit loose in the body (more than you can tell on the model) - more like a true swing style top. i feel the arms are a good fit, but i ordered one size up from my normal since i'm planning to wear this as a maternity top. arms are definitely a size smaller than the body. the ruffles at the bottom are a bit odd, but overall i still like it. the cutout notch at the collar is super cute! plus, the green color of this top is lovely and i love that it's made in the usa so i'll be keeping"
1,"Quality issues This is a truly beautiful dress, and yes, so much better in person.  upon examining the dress, however, i saw some problems.  the embroidery above the waistline was loose in places, there were some frayed ends, and even some &#39;fuzzy&#39; spots where it looked like the stitching had rubbed against something.  the dress is over $250, and for that price i expect the embroidery to be top-notch.  returning and hope the replacement is in better shape.  if so, it will be a keeper!"
1,Definitely a star! A must have sweater with great details. it can be a star piece with leather tights or very long flare jeans. i recommend platform booties for perfect body proportion.
1,Cute fall casual top This top fits a bit trimmer than the summer version of this top did. the lavender color is muted and a nice fall transition color.
0,"Veille peasant top I was able to get this on sale. when it arrived, it was missing half of the rhinestones. i am very surprised that this top would be sent out this way. it also was missing the little bag with extra stones. i'm reaching out and wondering if anyone else has experienced this and is there a store that sells rhinestones like the one on the blouse? any help from anyone would be appreciated. i hate to part with this, but where was quality control?"
1,Beautiful! I love this blouse! the details are beautiful and and it is so versatile! i can where it with jeans and boots or slim black pants and strappy sandals and get tons of compliments every time. one of my favorite retailer purchases ever!
0,"Like a tent I ordered my usually size, xs, and it's just so wide and unflattering. looks like i'm wearing a tent. i don't understand why tops anymore are either huge or skin tight. why not something in between?!  the pink color is really pretty and the details are nice but it's just blah in terms of the fit."
0,"Not for me High quality, yummy soft fabric, gorgeous color. even with those three pros, this jumpsuit is not for me. i am 5'2"" and 150 lbs, size 10-12 m/l in the lines that retailer carries. i own one of their jumpers and it is very flattering! this one, however has capri pants, hits awkwardly at the midsection and makes my torso look even more square. on a tall, thin woman, it probably works!"
0,Boxy Great color and quality but very boxy. even with the drawstring there is no shape going on here.
1,"Slipped on the slip I love designs that are flowy/drapey in the front, so this hits the mark when tied in the back. has lots of visual interest. but i agree with the other reviewers.. the slip is super small. dress fits true to size, if not a bit large but the slip is one full size smaller. and you must wear a slip. overall, i'm pleased with the look."
1,"Motif over-the-knee socks This product is awesome! i'm a tall lady with wide calves and thighs and these socks look and feel fantastic on me; they are tight enough that they don't wind up sliding down around my ankles, but not so snug that they make my legs look like sausages. i would recommend this product to all of my girlfriends."
0,"Interesting This dress did end up working out for me. however i am very narrow in my chest and shoulders and i can see how it would be too tight on anyone with a med-lrg chest and/or broad shoulders. the fabric is light weight, nice for summer. it will need to be ironed and will wrinkle easily but it still looks well made to me. the slip is smaller than the dress but i feel that the dress is supposed to be ""drapey"". i kept it."
1,"Jumpsuit fever I'm liking this jumpsuit, it's not love but it's definitely a like. i typically avoid the elevenses brand since it never seems to fit right but i gave this a try. i usually take a l in other retailer brands but sized up to xl in this and it was a good choice. first off, the material is awesome, super soft and drapey. but i agree with another reviewer who mentioned the zipper being short and it being tough to get into. i found that to be right on, makes it a little hard to get your arms through the"
1,"Staple! I was considering this online for days before a ladies lunch date meandered into a brick & mortar location. i had been thinking of sizing up, if i ordered online, just to be sure it wouldn't be too tight or awkward, and when i had looked for it in stores nearby, it was out of stock, but i hadn't thought to look for my tts, which happened to be available in the store where i went. i tried it on, because i was so curious, and it worked!! i love it. it is so easy-breezy. it will be perfect to layer"
1,"Adorable This jacket is totally adorable. i wore it with a man tailored shirt with the color up and the sleeves poking out.
it has a great swing to it and is very comfortable! it is sized perfectly. and i got it on sale!!!"
1," I just purchased this cardigan, it is better in person than the picture. the fit is fabulous, it is very versatile. it can be worn with many different options, definitively be wearing often."
1,"Lovely sweater Great sweater. looks and fits as shown. if you're between sizes, size down as the shoulders are relatively broad."
0,"Odd fit I love the idea of this top.  i had reservations when i ordered it d/t the large armholes but i envisioned wearing my cute cropped pilcro jean jacket with it.  it turned out to be a disappointment.  the armholes are gigantic and the sweater itself did not fit as on the model.  the front was much shorter and wider and basically stuck out from my body.  for reference, i ordered the xxsp.  sizing up might have lengthened the front but would have exacerbated the armhole problem."
1,"Disappointed with the fit This is a beautiful lined jacket, with a much more structured fit than a typical kimono. it hit me at the high hip, not low hip as shown on the model. given how structured it is, i don't think the ""one size"" will work for anyone larger than a small if you want a drapey kimono fit."
1,Lovely skirt This skirt is stunning. the red is so vibrant. this will be a staple in my wardrobe for years to come. it can be dressed up or down. love it!
1," This dress is perfect for my florida lifestyle because of the fabric and the design. it is not the color pictured on the web page which was a disappointment. the color is a lot duller. i tried it on in the store and found it to be tight across the chest, another lady who also tried it had the same problem. i went home and ordered a larger size. that dress was baggy and not as cute in the back. i realized because of the under slip it could be left open to the waist and work just fine. i ended up"
1,"Versatile; size down Much nicer in person -- the chunky knit reads more gray with black accents than ""blue"" as described here. there are lovely flecks of rust, blue, goldenrod, green throughout. super soft, stretchy; it's fine sizing down...otherwise the arm holes dip down very low. i'm usually a size 4/small and xs was best for me (33"" bust, long torso, broad shoulders). i can see wearing another layer underneath when cold weather sets in."
1," I'm sad i was unable to get an xs, as the small is somewhat big on my 125-lb 5'6 frame. i'm keeping it for the sale price though! when i put it on in the store i got so many compliments from other customers who went to find it! i think it is meant to run large, and honestly i still think even with it looking big it still looked better in person than the model. i would recommend ordering it if you can and don't mind pieces that drape like this!"
1,"Great jumpsuit I bought this in the olive green and blue a while ago, both in the small. great jumpsuit and true to size. i accidentally washed the blue one in the washing machine (in cold) but caught it before the dryer. it still fits, although it seems a bit shorter in the legs."
1,"Great bikini top if you cna find the right fit I ordered this top in a size 'm' as i heard mara hoffman runs small. the size chart on her site would have me order a size 's' as i have a 33"" bust (33-25-~37). however, my bra size is a 30d or 32c and the size m is what fit. therefore a m might also fit a 34b and a 36a as the back is adjustable. it even stays up without the halter which is highly unusual for me.

the only negative that really disappointed me is that the patterns are not quite symmetrical as i expect from this brand and from t"
1,"Great for smaller women This is a well-made kimono style jacket, in a great color choice that is versatile and well constructed. being short and with narrow shoulders, most kimono-style jackets don't work on me; they are simply too big & too long. this jacket's shorter length and more streamlined styling make it perfect for me. a keeper, and a real steal on sale."
1,"Beautiful top, but very thin This top has a beautiful pattern, and the color is gorgeous - just like the photo. it is very thin, but under a sweater or blazer in the fall/winter would be perfect. it is a little big! i would order a size down."
1," This is adorable and unique. i've tried shawls and ponchos before, they usually swallow me up, this sweater has that type of feel but isn't so much fabric. goes with everything."
1,"Flattering and attractive!!!! Love these shorts! not too tight and not too short! they match so many tops! tts for my hard to fit figure! great for weekends, vacations, and just to be adorable in!"
1,"Delicate and adorable This is such a great top - it can be easily dressed up or down. i love my tops flowy, and this is just that! i have a larger chest (34d) and the flowy nature of it keeps it from being too short up front. even though it has eyelits in it, it can be worn without a cami underneath as long as you wear a good nude bra. it'll be a great sweater for all seasons. i'm even able to wear it to work. highly highly recommend."
1,"Unique and pretty I wore this sweater last weekend and received so many compliments. not only is this a very pretty style, the poncho is comfortable. i really glad i purchased."
1,"Notfor ""squat"" thighs I love these shorts, very pretty and well made, but if you have any kind of muscle in your thighs, beware, not as flattering as on the model a9dn probably previous reviewer). shorts hit at hte widest part of my leg, creating a weird tent effect around the area. waist was true to sizw and i can only imagine how beautiful they would be on ""skinny"" legs."
1,"Pretty I thought this sweater was pretty and soft and would be comfortable to wear. i really liked the high collar and the interesting poncho-like design. but the sleeves were a bit short on me. and i thought it was a little pricy. i decided against it for those reasons. but if you don't mind those things, then you might like it. it's definitely worth the try."
1,"So cute but not for petite customers This is the cutest poncho style sweater (but the arms aren't attached like a true poncho. it doesn't work for a petite customer, unfortunately, but on average sized it's gorgeous. so pretty."
0,"Poor patterning yet super fit The navy blue lines on my dress on the very top of the interior layer can be seen through the upper layer at the very top and it looks cheap. for this price, i would expect more thoughtful patterning. the fit is amazing, so i am debating whether i should keep or return."
1," Adorable! great for yoga or everyday use. can even fit a strapless bra under with no showing(i purchased the black). i'm 5'4"", usually a 6-8 and it fit great."
1,A cutie I absolutely love this sweater. it will take me into spring and right on in to summer beach bonfire nights. a great staple!
1,"Lovely piece The look, quality, and feel of this jacket is perfect. it does run a large so i would order a size down. i definitely worth every penny."
1,"Confusing design This dress has a unique watercolor-like pattern and design and is silk, but as another reviewer mentioned it is unlined so you probably would want to add your own slip. the side slits come up high, almost to the hip. i am 5'1"" and bought the petite xs and it comes all the way down to my toes if i don't wear a belt. if i belt it, the length is more like one would expect from a maxi dress. i am a little puzzled as to where i would wear this because the length and fancy sleeves make it seem more fo"
0," Loved this top, but had to return it. the collar is gorgeous but terrible quality"
1,"Beautiful sweater! Beautiful, detailed sweater. when i tried it on, i felt it made me look a tad bit boxy, but once i pushed the sleeves up about six inches, i loved the way it looked! i'm wearing it tomorrow and know i will get lots of compliments!"
1,"Beautiful design and feel but... - this really is lovely. the overall design from the arms, front, and back makes this poncho unique. it's not too thick, either, making it a nice everyday sort of thing. however, it just didn't work for me. even though i'm 5'9"", ponchos have a tendency to"
1,"Unique and comfortable! I was able to grab two of these in grey and navy during one of their awesome sales. it doesn't look like much on the hanger, but it's lovely on the body.
____________
pros:
- lots of stretch.
- comfortable and roomy without looking frumpy.
- lovely color and texture.
- can size up or down depending on how you want it to look.
- minimizes bust size nicely.

cons:
- if you have curves like me, it won't be as roomy as the model, unless you size up. i actually bought a size down and it b"
1,"Easy to wear, casual-elegant I ordered this in xs and it fits loosely (i am 5'3"" and about 120 lbs). this looks great with skinny jeans or leggings and shows off the long necklaces that are in style right now. the chiffon doesn't lie perfectly along the side seam, but i'm sure only i notice."
1,"Super cute! This is such a cute sweater! i wouldn't really call it a poncho since it has standard sweater sleeves. it has a wide circle hem which is very flattering. i would have loved this even more if it were available in other colors besides white.... red, black, or navy would have been perfect!"
1,"Gorgeous and approachable This sweater has instantly become a favorite. it is incredibly soft, the detailing is delicate and feminine, and the fit is cozy and flattering. the body has a definitive swing cut while the arms are slim - though not tight. i find the loose body, slim arm combination to be very flattering and forgiving. run out and buy this now if you love anywhere where it gets cold, foggy or dark -- it's a guaranteed go-to!"
1,Phenomenal find! I happened upon a pair of these shorts that someone had returned. they are the perfect length. they are very well made. i have worn them to my son's baseball game and the sec tournament. they are tailored and have an interesting design. they make me look as though i have lost ten pounds. i am thrilled with them.
1,Beautiful piece! This is so beautiful and looks hand made but in a really good professional way. this will be a perfect fall wardrobe addition and i can't wait to wear it with a long sleeve top and jeans and boots. it's not too long and it is very flattering and soft and drapes well. love it.
1,"Timeless Beautiful and flattering, i am a 6 across the board but felt the small was too small. ordering a medium cause i need this beauty for fall."
1,"Overpriced but couldn't pass up Living in florida, i thought the design of this sweatshirt was to die for. i was so pleased with the quality when i received the top; however i was nervous to see that it recommended washing before wearing due to the dying process. i washed cold gentle cycle and tumble dried low. turned out perfect and did not shrink! it's adorable. plan to wear it with white denim shorts. i ordered a size 1 and i normally wear a size small."
1,"Fantastic fabric Love this piece. can be worn casual or fancy. runs slightly big, but that seems to be the style. size down if you are in between sizes. the color is unique and organic. really comfortable and fun fabric."
1,"Comfortable and classy Hack: wrap the sash around waist twice and tie in back!! agreed with other reviewers it is a bit sack like when the sash tied in front as seen on model. but wrap twice, and it makes the silhouette pop. fabric is rediculously lush, and pattern is very sophisticated. stunning dress, will be wearing all summer -- with flats for work, with heels for evening. oop, my usual size, fits perfectly (5'4, 110 lbs)."
1,Beautiful blouse- does run large Saw this in the store yesterday and had my daughter try it on. it was really cute on her and she loved it. in fairness to the other reviewers she tried on a size 0 which was perfect for her petite frame and i can see how this blouse would run really big in the larger sizes. but the fabric and detail is so pretty and it was on sale.
0,"Sizing issues This immediately caught my eye in the neutral pattern, and the fabric is actually quite nice. the fit is at least a size or two too large though, with the bust being way too large for me even sizing down. my normal 4 was big everywhere, and the 2 was still big in the chest, but fit everywhere else. the belt is handy for cinching in some of the loose areas, but the top section just didn't work for me. maybe better for someone better endowed?"
0,"Not flattering unless you are tall and willowy I was on the fence about this dress because even on the model, it's a little bit frumpy, but it was so pretty that i tried it. however, on my short frame, it's even frumpier. the quality is very good, the fabric is soft and it's lined. the pattern is really pretty and delicate and i wish it was more flattering. i think the only way this dress will look good is if you are quite tall and thin. i am 5'4"", 110 lbs with large-ish hips and i ordered a 2p, but even the petite was too saggy. i needed a"
1,"Snap this up! you won't be sorry. Love this! only wish it wasn't so seasonal so i could wear it more often. this is the softest shirt in my wardrobe. can't believe how nice it feels on. a little bit slouchy and over-sized. i usually wear a m and bought a m and it feels perfect. like the other reviewer, i was a bit worried about shrinkage but washed it in cold and hung it up and and it cam out fine. did wash first before i wore because the dye smelled a bit strong."
0, I had hoped this blouse would be white - but it is cream in color. it was also more boxy than i thought it would be. i am usually a 4 or a 6 and went with the 6. a size 4 would be a better fit.
1," This dress is easy and attractive. it's very soft and just slips on, but looks very put together. on my shorter frame, it's a bit long, more midi length, but it's so comfortable and pretty, that i'm fine with it; it looks a little bit 20's that way. recommended."
1,"Nice, classy, comfortable dress I tried the b&w one in the store. liked the look and feel of it. fabric is soft and comfortable. for reference, i'm 5'4"" and 115 lbs. this dress runs large. size 0 was too big on me - armhole, waist, length, etc. i'm ordering 0p online, hoping it will fit better. not a huge fan of the black belt, otherwise very happy with the dress."
1,"Obsessed This dress is very soft and ultra comfortable. i got a size 10 and probably could have gotten away with an 8 but due to being busty on top stuck with the 10. i love the length ,even though i got the regular and not the petite."
1,This sweater was better than i expected. I was pleasantly surprised when i tried on this sweater. it is well made and fit perfect. the will really enjoy weather this in the fall.
1,"Sweet and airy This blouse was just right for me. 5'3' and in my late fifties. not too frilly so still age appropriate yet feminine and fun. i have largish arms from working out and the sleeves fit with give. and at this stage of life, the boxy look that falls just below the waist is flattering. i took a 10 regular (i'm usually a medium r or m-petite) and the fit was comfortable and right. both colors are unusual and it works nicely with pants and skirts."
1,Must have! Love this vest!  just got it in the mail last week and i have already worn it twice with two different looks.  it's timeless and can be worn in so many fun ways!
1,Beautiful summer dress! I ordered a sp which is normally the size i wear from retailer i'm 5ft and 129lbs. and there is so much extra material on the bottom part of the dress. it would make a beautiful summer dress if it was at least 2inches narrower on the bottom. unfortunately they are out of the xsp which would be perfect. still contemplating whether to keep or return.
1,"Gorgeous print I sized down in this dress from a 6 to a 4 (32d-31-38). the 6 was too blousy in the bust and it did feel ""sack-like"". i sized down and suddenly it looked great--fitted enough through the bust and hips. be warned--this dress has to be pulled over your head. the fit in the bust will determine a lot. i am tall--almost 5' 9"" and the length was great--similar to the model in the photo. the cream and black print is gorgeous."
1,"Can't wait to wear it! I just bought this dress yesterday in the store and love it. i'm 5'1"", 110#, 34b and purchased the 0p, which fits perfectly.

it's made of a cool material and is lined which adds to the quality of the dress. i love the neutral print and the square v-neck makes it a little different than just an average dress. this dress can be dressed up or down, depending on accessories. it also makes a great work dress if you add a little cardigan or blazer. very versatile and a great buy, especially a the s"
1,"Comfortable and fits all body types This dress looks better in person. the shape is pretty much straight, but fits nicely even if you are curvier. it doesn't show your imperfections. the type blue and white color is nice, but a bit see through on the bottom and the slip is a little short. came to about mid thigh for me so i would wear leggings underneath. i don't think a belt would look good with this because of the shape and if you have curves. very cool summer style."
0,"Too wide I wanted to love this dress. i am not comfortable wearing dresses much above the knee and i liked the length and the way this looks on the model. however, in person this dress is cut like a sack. it is not tapered at all in the waist and there is just too much fabric when you cinch the belt, at least on me. it was oddly shapeless, even with the belt. it seemed a size too large. i ordered the xxsp. for reference i am 5'1"" and 107 lbs. i ordered the neutral dress and i really like the fabric and c"
1,"Pretty, soft and comfortable I honestly don't understand whey this top isn't sold out. i have it in both colors and love it! it's a cool, gauzy woven fabric, super soft and perfect for warm weather. the white fabric is doubled so it's not see-through, the pink (more of a pale terracotta) is doubled halfway up, so it's slightly sheer on top but your pants/skirt waistband will not show through. it is a loose-fitting top, so you may be able to size down. i usually wear size 4p, but it was sold out so i got regular size 2 and i"
0,"Not for those with hips This dress (i ordered the ivory) is stunning. it is fully lined, the belt adds a needed accent, and the print on the fabric is gorgeous. the fit, though, is another issue. i typically wear a 2-4 depending on the cut and fabric of dresses, and am pretty proportionate with my hips/bust. i ordered a 2 in this dress. it was enormous on the top and painfully tight on my hips and thighs. the fabric has absolutely no give - it needs to drape perfect or it looks awful. if you have any type of hip, thigh"
1,Perfect This is the perfect duster! transitions you perfectly from summer to fall without being an overly heavy piece. simple and classic! i know i will get a lot of wear out of this item!
1,"Perfect summer robe I'm fussy about robes. i'm fairly small (size 2 or 4) and a lot of robes swamp me. in the smaller size, this robe fit well and was flattering. the material is soft but absorbent. the pattern is lovely and feminine without being dowdy. the wrap is generous--i wear this robe just out of the shower and don't feel exposed."
0," Ordered this in white, thought would be really cute. but didn't like, and returned it. i am big busted and it was unflattering teh way it draped."
1,So pretty! I love this top! nice lightweight material but not too sheer. runs a little big and may be slightly too boxy for some people; for me it was perfect.
1,"So pretty This top is so pretty and festive. i am purchasing it for a holiday party. i debated between a m and l, but went with the m, and i'm glad i did. it is generously sized. finding bottoms for it has been a little tricky. i'm thinking i will try the velvet pants as shown."
1,"Summery 20s dress I love the cut of this dress, and i'm rather short. i don't think you need to be tall. it's a nice, light fabric that will work well for warm weather. it did wrinkle quite a bit during the day, but never looked messy. i certainly wouldn't describe it as frumpy. it has a nice, loose, 1920s feel, and you can tighten the belt to make it more fitted through the waist. the belt is sewn on in the back, so you can't take it off without quite a bit of tailoring. i had no trouble with the bust being too"
1,Perfect jacket for cool summer nights I love this jacket! it is stylish and is ideal for a casual night out
1,Sexy and classic This is my first time purchasing a bra from this brand and i am in love. the style and quality are amazing. it is the most comfortable bra i owned to date and i will be buying more from this line. it provides a lift without all of the uncomfortable padding which requires continuous adjusting. i am saying goodbye to vs forever. i got this in red and the bra looks more expensive than it actually is and the fit is simply amazing.it is sexy and classic at the same time.
0,"Huge blouse I tried this blouse on in the store. i'm generally an 8 or 10 in this brand. i got down to a size 4 and gave up. this blouse is huge all the way around. the detail on the blouse is pretty, but the tent like cut made it impossible for me to buy it. i know retailers blouses can be swingy and flows but this went way beyond. perhaps on a tall person the swing would work but on a short person like myself...i looked ridiculous."
1,"Lovely! Well-made, gorgeous bra! the 'red' is more wine in person, which is great. this bra runs quite small--go up at least 1 band and 1 cup size. i got a 36c and it fits great! (i'm a 34b across brands like vs, etc.) 
you'll feel extra saucy and a bit mischievous knowing you're wearing something this sexy."
1,"Simple and comfortable Love this dress.  wear it with sneakers or boots.  can add a belt, or the right accessories to dress it up."
1,"Cozy lounger In the on-line picture this lightweight sweatshirt looked so inviting that i decided to order it. when it arrived, i could not believe how soft and comfortable it felt! it was equally comfortable on. the rayon, tencel and cotton content of the fabric created such a comfy feel, that this top is sure to be a favorite for a relaxing week-end or evening. i ordered the size 3 even though i usually order a small in most tops. this one seems to lend itself to the oversized look, and i was right about t"
1,"Terrace robe Absolutely perfect for summer. great weight, lovely soft lining. love pockets in any robe. sleeve length is perfect. actually flattering, if you consider robes such a thing. i love it!"
0,Boxy This top is too boxy and has too much going on. it should have no buttons or different ones.
1,"Beautiful but not for my body The color and fabric of this item are so appealing and i think this is a great piece for the right person. the fabric is beautiful but also much thicker than i'd imagined from the photos. it has a quilted quality so doesn't drape very well and is just too much fabric for me around the arms. i typically wear a size 12 and ordered the large. i think a medium might have been better. haven't decided yet whether to exchange for m or just plain return. has an artsy, cool professor vibe that i like."
1,"An easy and polished dress! This is such an easy dress to wear and it looks very polished! it is not a ""cheap polyester"" fabric as one reviewer wrote. it is a rayon and nylon blend. it does wrinkle easily. i love that the belt is actually sewn into the dress at the back. i don't typically gravitate toward warm color palette, but the burnt orange color is really lovely. it can be dressed up or down very easily. and it has pockets! i typically wear xs in retailer brands, and the size 0 fit me well."
1,Beautiful blouse! I found this while shopping at my local retailer and loved it. i was able to size down from my normal 10 to a 6. i got the warm white and it's lovely - couldn't wait to wear it. the detail is so pretty and love the buttons and 3/4 length sleeves - i am thrilled! i couldn't be happier!
0,"Soft, pretty, tts, but sack-like The material is soft and the pattern is pretty, but it fits like a sack. it's too bad that this wasn't more form-fitting, with some stretch and a zipper, because its fit is just not beautiful. for tall, very slender ladies, this will be pretty, as it is in the photo. it fit me just fine (with a little extra room on top), but it went right back into the bag without a thought."
1,"Adorable! I chose the petite small for the shorter length & fits perfectly. it falls abt 3"" below my knees. normally i am a small in tops. waiting for some cooler weather to wear with some of my swing style turtlenecks i have & jeans. 5'3"", 115#, 3c. looks pretty much on me as in the pic."
0,"Ehh not a fan :/ My personal opinion is that i am not a fan of this top, the material of the fabric doesn't seem as nice as delettas other tops and it had a really boxy fit on me. i wanted to love this top but i did not."
1,"Darling swing dress Cute and comfy. seems to fit true to size. flattering and roomy on top for my 34ddd shape, but doesn't make me look pregnant or fat overall, which sometimes happens without a waist to define shape. super cute!"
1,"A bit more fabric than expected Overall, the dress is beautiful, easy, and great quality. but the bottom part has more fabric than it appears in the photo, if that makes sense. it's not poofy or super-layered, but i had to pinch fabric on a part of the dress in order for it to have that more straight/shift shape that you see online here. besides that bottom part, the fit is true to size. but as a petit, the extra fabric isn't what i'm looking for.
i think it works depending on what you're looking for. beautiful though!"
1,"Love love love....but I, too, saw this jacket on the recent retailer email teaser and instantly i was in love. i put it in my cart and was contemplating buying it but was unsure on size etc since there was only one review. i came back to find it was no longer available and i was devastated. i was at my local mall today and decided to pop in. much to my delight, they had a rack full of this coveted jacket. it's very cute, stylish, not very thick and the quality was ...just ok. there was a slightly worn look, that perhap"
0,"Too small! Not as cute as photos, and too small in chest. i am 5'5'', 125 lbs, and the small was too tight in the chest, and i am not large here at all. shoulders and sleeve length fit well. will return. not comfortable, and will need to be able to button it on rainy days."
1," First of all, this top runs big. i'm 5'5"" 120 and there was still plenty of room to spare in an extra small. this is a cute top but i returned it because it was too stiff and boxy for me. the fabric is thicker than your average tee, and there's not much give, so it may not hang well on all body types. i might revisit it if it goes on sale because i like the design with the small details at the sides but this was an easy pass for me at the regular price."
1," Oh this skirt is gorgeous but i feel it runs small in the waist!!
i'm sending it back and ordered up- i'm happy i did as today it's sold out.
beautiful and vibrant colors, very well made- just wish some of the retailer sizes wouldn't run on the smaller side!!!"
1," These are my favorite jeans i've bought in the past year! they're the perfect length for booties, i love the rise, and the denim feels amazing- so soft. mine haven't stretched more than a normal jean (in fact they may have stretched less than others i've had), and i can wear then multiple times before washing with their shape being in tact."
1," Love this top! so soft, fits perfect."
1,"In love This dress is absolutely adorable. runs true to size, i am five foot nine and a medium fit perfect. the denim has a lot of stretch. i can't wait to wear it in the winter with tights and boots! don't wait too long before this one sells out."
1,"A navy trench-yes! I am a big fan of trench coats and i love that this one is navy. i typically gravitate toward blues because it brings out my eyes and my wardrobe tends to fall in a blue-ish category. i love that the color of this coat will compliment other pieces of clothing in my closet wonderfully.

i especially love the design of the trench with the wider, pleated bottom which allows for fluffier dresses but also creates an illusion that is slimming for anyone's figure. this is a fantastic, unique design for"
1,"These jeans are amazing! I love, love, love these jeans! they fit like a dream and the fabric is so soft and giving. the waist comes up higher and stays snug, which means no muffin top. plus they look awesome! i truly hope paige comes out with more like this!!"
1,"Cute but . . . This dress is adorable. the color is on the red orange side and is nice for the summer. the cotton is also nice and light. however, the bust is cut short and the skirt is unforgiving to girls with hips. if you have b/c cup or less and do not have an hour glass figure then this dress may be for you."
0,"Faulty zipper problem I ordered not one but two sizes of this dress to try on and was hoping to ultimately wear to an event - one 00 petite, one 00. the style, color and cut are all perfect. one not so minor downfall, however. the zippers on both dresses were faulty - they both broke in the same spot, both during the first time just trying them on. i can't get either of them to even budge now - will either need to take back or get fixed. very sad about this."
1,So excited but then this I love the pants and it's so soft and they're great. today was the first day i wore them for more than just a try on and i noticed a hole. that's super disappointing but i'm hoping it was just bad luck ;(
0,"Please stop going down in fabric quality I've been wearing these shorts for years, i work outside and it was great to have comfortable jean shorts that were just the perfect length. the fabric quality on these shorts (and many many other retailer items) has gone down. sure, they're great when you try them on in the store..soft, comfortable, flattering, but when these are worn for a day they get so stretched out that i feel like i need a belt to keep them on. i wore these several times, sat down on a relatively smooth concrete wall, and a"
1,Comfy and cute Very comfortable sweater. the material is very soft and not itchy at all. i had the hardest time deciding between sizes. the medium was slightly longer and loose through the arms. a bit of a boxy shape. the small was slightly more fitted through the arms and instead of hanging straight had a slight fit and flare look to it but still loose. ended up going with a small since it was less boxy. it's a sweater that can look more put together or more laid back just depending on sizing but overall love
1,Gorgeous skirt Absolutely love this skirt. it is well made and fits as normal. i love the fact that it can be dressed up or down.
1,"So pretty This coat is fun, flirty, & flattering. i bought it strictly for how good it looks on - it's not a coat for warmth. the top is tailored and fitted, but the bottom is very full and swings. (there is a lot of fabric on the bottom). i'm not sure why some people had a hard time with the sleeves - i do not have the smallest arms and this was not an issue for me. however, i had a very thin shirt underneath the coat and that is all you can fit under it, so keep that in mind. the small fit me perfect. v"
0,"Beautiful, but.... This skirt is beautiful. fabric is gorgeous,with perfect amount of shine and luxury to it. there is a ""life ""in this skirt; it is well made and follows the body lines in a perfect way. or,i better say, it did fit me perfectly first ten minutes of wearing it. unfortunately, it stretched more than a full size, and generally lost its shape. now, the skirt is two sizes too large and not really wearable anymore."
1,"Beautiful coat, but runs small I love this coat, and wanted it to fit so badly! a 12-14 always fits well, but i can't even start to button up the large in this coat. so sad!!!"
1,"The skirt has a pretty stained glass look Pretty cut out design. it is a great length for work but it is also unique enough to get compliments. the skirt seems true to size but the waist does not have a lot of ""give."" in this regard it may seem a little small."
0,"Too much of a goodthing Too much of a good thing is...still too much. there's too much flounce on this jacket for me--the waist sits slightly high, and the incredible amount of fabric beneath it (when you twill around, it's basically a full circle) makes my hips look huge. if there were about 1/3rd (not 1/2, but 1/3) the amount of fabric to the skirt, i'd be totally in love. 
as it is, i'll be returning it."
1,"Like, almost love I finally was able to order the xs petite (my typical size), adn received it. i had previously tried on the xs regular, but that was too much fabric. (i am 5 foot 1.5 inches, adn 115 lbs)

so the petite fit, but i still felt like the swing was a lot of fabric for me. classic cut, snug on the chest,so i wouldn't be able to wear a sweater underneath. overal, i did like,but decided to returrn it"
0,"Disappointed I had been eyeing this coat for a few weeks after it appeared in the email, and i finally decided to purchase it to treat myself. i was very excited to get it, as it is a beautiful coat online. however, once i received it i was very disappointed. the material is much thinner than i would expect for something that cost $168, and when i went to button it the button slipped right off the thread it was sewn onto the coat with. i checked the other buttons and all of them were loose as well.

1,"Timeless & classy trench I saw this in an email and loved it but by the time i tried to order it that evening, some sizes were already gone. the medium was back-ordered but didn't have to wait too long to receive it.. i especially like the design with the full skirt. the material is light weight, which is prefect for my florida climate. the design and fit were beautiful!!! i love it and will get years of use out of it. my only complaint is the material wrinkles very easily. i tried to get them out myself but ended up se"
1,"Lovely light jacket I had to size up to a medium because otherwise my boobs would not get along well with that button down front, but once that was taken care of i really loved the silhouette this created. the belted waist flatters an hourglass shape nicely. perfect for sipping tea and eating finger pastries like a fancy little lady. i have no idea what i'm going to do when the time comes to wash it though... we'll cross that road when we come to it, i guess. also - the interior seams are a bright, electric blue -"
1,"Fun skirt The pictures do not do this skirt justice! it is reminiscent of the vintage mexican circle skirts with a pretty lace design. the fabric is nice and light and it is a lot of fun to wear.

it is definitely one to consider washing by hand. i put mine in a lingerie bag and washed it on the gentle cycle, but the bottom edge of the lace frayed a bit. it is nothing a pair of scissors can't fix, but to avoid any further damage, i will be washing it by hand in the future!"
1,"Lovely, substantial skirt This skirt is great for anyone who wants to highlight a defined waistline, but may want to skim over a few lumps and bumps. the skirt has a nice, wide waistband that hugs tight at the middle and pleats that give a little flare without being too much.

the fabric is nice and thick and the skirt is lined.

i am looking forward to wearing it to the office with a fitted dark top and heels."
1,"Gorgeous but fitted This was sold out in an xs when i first saw the email. i ended up seeing in my local retailer store and tried on my usual xs. i am 5'3"" with a longer torso and about 108 pounds. my chest size is 32c and the xs was just too tight. it buttoned up beautifully and the length was as it is on the model, even though i am much shorter. however, when i tried to move my arms, the jacket constricted all movement. this is a huge disappointment and i imagine going to be an issue for many girls who order online"
1,"I'm sure it looks great on the right body type I loved this trench on the web site, i couldn't wait until it arrived and was even happy to pay full-price to get it! it unfortunately just didn't complement my 5'2"" 135 lb curvy figure as i had hoped. it was definitely much fuller on the bottom which added unnecessary bulk. i have narrow shoulders and it was snug and uncomfortable with a simple tank top on. i hung it in my closet for a few weeks, tags intact, continuing to try it and each time it just wasn't working. it also had many stray thre"
0,"Avant garde-ish dress Love the way this dress looks online. sadly, it doesn't look great on me. i'm 5'4"", athletic build. the small fit perfectly, but the extra fabric in the hip/pocket area just seemed to drag me down. i really wished this worked for me, but i think you've gotta be a little bit taller to pull this one off."
1,"Feminine professional look I was looking for a dress for an upcoming interview. this fit the bill. when i took it out of the packaging i was worried it would be boxy, but it hit in all the right places. it was loose enough allowing for movement, but accentuated my waist. it hangs to just above my knee in an xl (i typically wear a 14-16). i was very impressed with the material. it feels very soft and luxurious."
1,"Very kate middleton The photos do an amazing job of selling this coat. in person it is just a little bit less than what i was hoping for. the navy blue color is lovely and elegant and fits the sophisticated femininity of this style. black or khaki would be too boring.

the fabric is soft and drapes and flows beautifully, but it is quite thin. if you hold the coat up to the light you can almost see through it! the thinness probably helps the flattering fit of the coat, but i don't know how effective that makes it at"
0,"Literally unwearable. I purchased this in-store in a vivid red color, but didn't try it on until i got home. big mistake! literally the first time i tried to zip the dress, the cheap, horrible zipper noted in previous reviews just...broke. midway up, right under the waist tie. i was trapped in the dress for a good 15 minutes and was scared i'd have to rip or cut the fabric to get out of it; eventually i pulled the zipper apart to escape. can't wait to return this asap."
0,"Quality changed Pilcro stet roll ups are my fave! i have about 5 or 6 pairs and i needed a replacement for my light wash so i went in the store and tried these on. wow has the quality changed. the denim is a lot lighter in material, now, the wash isn't as real, almost like i'm wearing jegging shorts. these were my favorite but now i'll have to look for light wash denim shorts elsewhere because these new ones just wont cut it anymore! why, pilcro?? the sizing is about the same, they run a little large due to the"
0,"Weird fit I fell in love with this trench when i first saw it online but ended up returning it once i tried it on. i'm 5'9, 140 lbs and the m fit true to size. but the belt hit above my natural waistline and the skirt of the coat was much fuller than i expected, making me look heavier. the material also wrinkles easily and the stitching was poor quality with lots of loose threads. disappointed, as the color and concept were great."
0,"Beautiful, dramatic trench, but impractical upkeep This trench is beautiful, with a lovely, swinging skirt that adds a romantic sense of drama and movement - you'll feel as though you are starring in your very own film noir movie. i wish i could have kept it, but i couldn't justify paying full price on a coat that had to be hand-washed (the label specifies no dry cleaning!).there is a lot of fabric on this trench, and i imagine that all those little pleats will have to be ironed too. i don't have the time for that, and for this much money, i wou"
1,"Unusual, stylish, comfy I like the edge of this dress and it balances my narrower hips well. i'm usually between 0p and 00p in retailer dresses and xxsp definitely fit better on my 5'1"" frame (armpits and knee-length where it should be)

love that it's machine washable and unusual. super soft and beautiful color even though i normally gravitate to cooler colors.

bring it on everleigh!"
1,"Cute dress! I love the bright red color and also the texture of fabric. it's light, soft and crisp, which is perfect for summer days. the dress is definitely designed for people with a short torso. the waste line is a bit high for me, but overall it didn't feel weird or look funny. there is just something about this dress that made me very difficult to part with. once i tried it on, i had to bring it home with me!"
1,"A classic piece! This dress is beautiful! the concept looked really striking online and it really delivered in person. the material is a good weight for winter but soft and really quite luxurious. the collar is subtle and adds a lot of elegance.there's not a lot of stretch though. i'm 5'5"", 130lbs, and usually btw xs, xsp, s, and sp and will probably go with the s on this one. you have to try this on!"
0,"Too much fabric for a petite I just loved this when i saw it in store. beautiful fabric, lovely color. i ordered a small petite because petite xs was sold out. i imagine it might be a little better if it were a size smaller, but there is sooo much fabric in the pleated bottom, unless you are blessed with exceptionally long legs, it might end up looking like a witches coat. at least that is what i was told by my daughter."
1,"Great top for a great price! I was a little worried this top wouldn't look quite as nice as it does online due to the price, but it is super cute in person too. tank underneath is attached but does not get in the way. great top! cannot wait to wear it!"
0,"Cheaply made The cut and color of the dress is awesome. however, the biggest flaw is the zipper. i only got to wear this dress once until the zipper broke..sad day especially at the price. there also were a number of loose threads. i recommend waiting until it goes on sale. you'll want the extra money for a tailor to fix that zipper."
1,"Very nicely made Great feeling trench. can dress it up or down.
just be prepared to take a steamer with you. it comes wrinkled and will wrinkle very easy."
1,"Perfect! My only complaint is that there is no lining. it also came very wrinkly and i need to figure out how to steam it.

however the fit is perfect (tts) and it is so very flattering!"
1,"Worth it for me I rarely write reviews on here, but this coat deserves a mention.

i have wanted a trench coat for a long time, but my build and coloring are not flattered by the traditional beige/khaki coat or cut. i leapt when i saw this one and immediately ran to my local store to try it on.

it is not *really* a rain coat, but more like a charming layer in the style of a coat. it's lightweight, soft fabric that swings really well - but also gets slightly wrinkly. the color is lovely and the buttons are"
1,"Gorgeous and timeless trench! First of all, i'm not a ""navy"" person at all. i much prefer black or other bright colors. i received an e'mail showing this trench last saturday and i pulled it up online and noticed how darling it looked. i didn't order it, but i went back the following day to check it out again. it was nowhere on the website. then a few days ago, back it popped up online again. i noticed it wasn't in my local store so i thought i'd go in and look this weekend. i just had to see it. i actually made it to the st"
1,"Multi-functional piece Saw this on the retailer emails as a cover and knew i had to try it on. went into the store following day and tried it. to my delight the tencel fabric is light enough for southern california weather and can be worn as a trench coat over skinny jeans, leggings or dresses or act as a dress in itself! love the navy color as it is has more of a washed looked and not too bold. what attracted me to this piece in the first place was the ruffled bottom and the rounded flaps on the back that is different"
1,"Lots of pros; one small frustration I'm tall with long legs, long arms, and a small chest, and the medium fits me almost perfectly. i love the long sleeves (sleeve length is always a challenge for me) and how the coat accommodates my broad shoulders. my only problem is that the belt wraps around my lower ribs and looks odd. if i can get the belt loops lowered 1.5-2 inches, it will be perfect. if i can't, i'll return it because the coat looks much better with the belt tied if it's buttoned up. one small point: the coat arrived incr"
1,"My ""go-to"" sweater This sweet little number in the mustard yellow has become my fall and winter ""go-to"" sweater. so easy to wear, understated and a bit retro. looks great tucked into skirts or high-waisted jeans, or out, and the subtle shift in textures is a nice detail. highly recommend, and a great price point!"
0,"Not for busty gals I'm usually a 12, or size l in retailer and when i tried this on, buttoning it up from the bottom, i was so excited...until i reached the chest. it was way too tight in the bust and i am not that big in that area - it was painfully tight on my 38d chest. it's also unlined, which makes it not very useful for anything other than the warmest times of year. it's a shame because the skirt is swishy, and a good length - many trenches are too short, or not wide enough on the bottom for a fuller figure. i"
0," Nice material, hits high waisted, mine was a return that was not repacked and was just balled in the bag and was so wrinkled that even if it looked good, you couldn't tell. very disappointed to have it arrive in that condition-so not typical of retailer."
0,"Beautiful but odd sizing I agree with other reviewers. it is beautiful but too tight around the chest. i am usually an xsmall and the xsmall was tight in the chest. i bought the small and it was still uncomfortable. sadly i had to return it. i am 5'4"", 134 lbs and a 34c, by no means i am considered big chested so this is highly unusual."
1,"Wonderful coat I love this coat. it's everything i've been looking for in a trench: navy blue, cut for dresses, with a vintage flair. and the medium fits like a glove (i'm a size 8). all that being said, be forewarned that this coat in unlined, so it won't be that warm a layer. the seams are covered in a bright turquoise bias tape so it doesn't seem especially unfinished. still worth the price on sale."
0,"Cute, but too boxy This shirt is adorable, love the lace detail on the sides, but way too boxy for me. it's a great lighter weight for spring, but it doesn't feel flimsy. sadly, there isn't any shape to help make this flattering. it will be returned."
0,Shorts aren't what they were Shorts don't fit me like they did the first time and i've only worn them twice! the material isn't what is use to be. it stretches out to fast. i don't think i will be buying these again. wish i could take them back.
1,"Fabulous feminine trench! The skirt on this trench has tons of fabric. it goes on and on, and drapes and twirls beautifully. as a trench, it fits well and does the trick. i believe the skirt is heavy enough not to blow around too much, but i haven't been out in extremely strong winds yet. it fits true to size, at the knee (i'm 5'5""). i sized up because i assumed i would be layering it over clothes. my regular size fit fine over a lightweight cardigan."
1,"Just as expected. The green is vibrant and beautiful, and the sweater is very soft."
1,"Classically contemporary Love this skirt! i enjoy being trendy, but i love the retro vibe. can be dressed up, or worn to work."
0,"Horrible quality I love maeve dresses and have always gotten a lot of wear out of them while still looking great. this dress does not meet those standards. on the 2nd wear of this dress the zipper completely broke. i had to take it to a dry cleaner to get replaced at a pricey cost for a pricey dress, i'm dissapointed."
1,"Jolly arms =/= jolly jacket I remember seeing this great jackets online and knowing that i would have to have it! so i traveled to the store to try it on. the ruffle on the bottom was beautiful and fluffy and just like the pictures. the color was perfect and it was lightweight enough i could get more uses out of it that most of my coats in the texas heat. so i tried on the small. the didn't quite button over my bust, and i did an arm wiggle that made the arms too tight near where they met my body. no problem, medium it is."
1,"Beautiful! Very pretty skirt, makes me feel very feminine and makes my waist look smaller than it is."
1,Worth the price This coat is absolutely beautiful. the fabric is soft and almost silky and the style is timeless. i ordered an xs and it fits true to size and has excellent quality.
0,"Disappointed I love maeve dresses but there are several issues with this one (for my taste). 1) the fabric and color closely resembles my medical scrubs, 2) the zipper is cheap and barely goes up or down, even when it's just on the hanger. 3) the bow is really cute but doesn't make up for the other shortcomings."
1,"S petite is oversized I usually wear a s petite so that's what i initially got in this. i'm 5'2"", 32c-27-36. the shoulders were about an inch too wide on either side, the sides along the top had tons of extra fabric (almost like batwings or a dolman cut) and the waist was at least 6"" too big! i'm re-ordering in petite xs and hoping for the best, because this is a gorgeous coat."
1,"Fun sweater This sweater is flattering, fun, and practical. i wear to work and out at night to dressier functions. i bought both the green and black. both are cute on and super soft."
1,"Love these jeans! After being tentative to splurge on skinny jeans (i've always been a small flare jean-girl), i am thrilled to say i love these jeans. the rise is perfect in that it ""holds in"" anything you want ""held in"" and makes a slim shirt look even better. i have worn them with booties and regular boots alike and have no complaints. i was unsure of the jean's claim to not stretch out but have been pleasantly surprised at how they have kept their shape...even after sitting for many hours at a time. wash cold"
1,"Cute, swingy skirted trench coat I'm 5'1, 100lb and tried on pxs, ps and xs. the portions on the petite are perfect for petite sizes however if you are a d cup, keep in mind that you cannot wear anything thick underneath it if you go with the fitted size. the sleeves are pretty slim in the petite xs too. i'm keeping the pxs skirted trench because it looks like a dress from the fifties (fitted and flared) and looks so cute unbuttoned (like on the model). also, unlike some trenches there are minimum details (like epaulets, contra"
1,"Perfect trench Can't say enough about the style of this trench, the material is soft and the shape is amazing for all body types. the color is great and there's some pretty aqua colored piping in the inside of the coat.

the sizing is a little hmmm. i ordered a large. i'm usually a 12 on top or a large, mostly to accommodate a larger chest (ddd i think). proportion wise i'm more a medium through the shoulders and in length, so sometimes i can size down to a medium or large petite depending on the shape.

1,"Non-stuffy trench This trench coat solves my eternal problem with trench coats - which is that when i see one on a model in an ad they look effortless and casual, but then when i try one on it looks rigid and stuffy somehow. this trench coat drapes beautifully. that said, it's not the same kind of fabric as a traditional trench coat so it probably isn't water resistant. i'm fine with that, it looks amazing."

0,"Cute but not worth the cost It's a perfectly cute simple summer dress, but the only reason i'm even considering keeping it is because it was a gift. the material is fine but for this price, i expect something more exciting than what is, really, just a modified t-shirt dress. at least more exciting colors or a print or something. the top piece is 2 full layers which could get warm in the summer, and the ribbing is tight enough that you have to wear a bra even if you're small-chested (i'm a 32b and super thin and still neede"

pros:
- fits tts. i'm either a 10 or 12 in most clothes and bought the l and it fit really well on my 5'9. 36c bust and hourglass frame. it wasn't boxy at all and still left enough for movement and still held a nice shape to my frame without being clingy.

1,"Cute & simple Tried it on in store and found it cute and comfortable, it might run a little big since i was expecting to fit into small but found the xs fit and looked better. i will consider when on sale. i felt that it was way over priced.however if money is no issue i would buy it."
1,"Discrepency between regular and petite So a bit of a bone to pick with retailer. i am normally a petite xs (32b chest). however the petite sizing was not available online so i ordered a regular xs thinking i could always have it altered. i could barely button across the chest. huh?! when i went to return it at the store, i noticed they had xs petite on the rack so decided to try it. it fits perfect - like how it should! i can button fine across the chest and there is a little extra room.

i have no idea why the sizing is so off between"
0,"Beautiful design, poor execution I knew i needed to buy this trench from the moment i saw it on my computer screen, but something prompted me to stop by my local retailer and try it on first. thank goodness for that.

at first glance, i knew i wouldn't be buying this. the construction leaves much to be desired. from the flimsy, single layer of unlined, unstructured fabric, to the thin strip of fabric serving as a belt, i could easily see this being sold at a cheap store for teenage girls where throwaway clothes are a dim"
1, I agree with the other reviews that the sleeves can be tight even for those with slim arms. life would be great in this coat if my arms were always down by my sides. but when i lift my arms that's another story. i also agree that the material wrinkles easily. this is a high-maintenance item as far as pressing and ironing goes. it is a very pretty feminine coat but i would reconsider this only if it goes on sale.
1," Cute skirt! i bought it to go with boots (tall and short) and looks great. if you pair it with the right top, it reminds me of the funky eclectic retailer look that this retailer is famous for! i usually wear a size 2 or 4 and i went with the 2 because it didn't hang so low. but that's just me."
1,"This coat is good quality, runs small It is a beautiful coat, runs small. arms feel tight, i am typically xs, i can't even button it up. bottom is skirted, and falls beautifully. it is light weight coat, not really fit for cold weather."
0,"Hand wash? Darling jacket/coat, similar styling as the beige with big flowers and lace-up back that i bought a few years ago and still love. i was considering this one, but the description says to hand wash. seriously? a coat? that's simply not practical. not sure if i will buy this one."
1,"Classic and elegant Got this style in both black and green. the fabric is soft and the neck design is very elegant! i am 5'3, 120lbs, 34dd bra and take this in size small."
1,"Cute! but not a coat Once i saw this trench coat i thought it was so cute! i'm usually a small in retailer tops but can be a little broad so i decided to go with the medium (based on other reviews). when i received the coat, it was a little tight in the shoulders but still doable. i was surprised how thin it was (just a single sheet of cloth) and how full the skirt bottom was (however, there is a cute light blue seem lining inside). overall this trench coat is not really a warm coat, but more of a fun piece to dress u"
0,Wanted to love it but... I really wanted to love this sweater after reading the reviews but when i received it i was sadly disappointed. it is pretty boxy and not much shape. could be cute for casual outfits but i was looking for some dressier sweaters.
0,Huge This is a beautiful top but the xs was literally 4-6 inches too wide. very disappointing! i am thin and tall but this was a maternity top on me. i don't usually wear xxs. it is much more voluminous than it appears in the picture and it is definitely gray and blue not white.
1,"Love love love this skirt! I want to wear this skirt every day - it's so much fun to wear and versatile and i just feel great wearing it!
can dress it up or down - it's pretty darn fabulous!
i highly recommend it - you'll be grateful and feel pretty!"
1,Cannot wait for spring! I saw this trench in an email a couple weeks back and instantly fell in love. i bought it for myself for my birthday and got it just the other day and it is just as beautiful in person as it is online. fits true to size and is so flattering. i love the true navy color and cannot wait to wear this on cool spring nights!!
0,"Must be tall & lean I wanted to love this coat so bad. the material is lovely and it's beautiful on the hanger but being tall and skinny is a must to pull it off. if you have any hips forget it (my hips are 38"")- you end up looking incredibly bottom heavy. the jacket also ran funny across the shoulders....like the underarm was sewn low down the arm so arm movement was restricted, it was weird. but it buttoned nicely without any pulling so it wasn't a size thing. i bought a size medium, at 5'5"" and 140 pounds."
1,"Navy femininity It goes without saying that trenches are timeless. but this one broke the mold with its femininity in the flare and the (finally!) different color. i saw this and put it in my cart, debated, and went back a few days later (as i always end up doing, because i could not live without it) and it was no longer available! i was devastated and could have kicked myself. but i waited a bit longer, went back on the website and thank god - retailer had ordered more from the designer and had replenished stock"
0,"Poofy not good for heavy legs The color is as pictured. good quality. it's lined. the zipper in the back makes it look updated. i ordered my usual size. small petite size 6. it fit perfectly. i'm 5 feet and 120 lbs. hourglass figure. i had high hopes. i have hips and short, heavy legs. the skirt only emphasized my flaws. if you've got great legs you will do well with this. i do own other short skirts. but the fact that is less tailored in look makes it better suited for a younger gal. if you're on the fence give it a try. it"
1,"True to size This dress looks better when wearing, i am 5.8 regular size s or 6. cup 34 d and fits perfect. length and width. in the front is shorter while the back has that pretty extra length. the video that is showing here is pretty much the full length.  but in case you need to adjust you can shorten easily. i wish the slip is the same length as the dress. i want this dress for a wedding anniversary by the beach so i will need to add some extra fabric. i hope it helps."
1,Shimmering green classic cocktail dress I love this dress because it is everything i have been looking for. it is flattering because of the details and it gives the illusion of an hourglass figure if you don't have one. i love that it has sleeves because sometimes i just don't feel like finding a shawl or bolero or whatever in case i get suddenly anxious about my arms. the green is dark and shimmering almost like lace over jewel tone emerald. love.
1,"I am a big fan of bailey 44 brand I feel like this brand is very good at coming up with dresses that are flattering and i feel like they tend to fit my body well. i like the design of the dress a lot because it makes me feel like i am walking along with beach-it gets me in the mood for summer, and it is the perfect casual everyday dress for the summer. i love that the color scheme is understated which reinforces that this could be warn anywhere-even for everyday use. the strips are perfect for the look of this dress, and i don't"
0,"Disappointed--will return I ordered this dress online in order to get a petite size and am very disappointed. as other reviewers have mentioned, the fabric overlay is very different in person than it appears in the online pictures. the dress is much more casual and looks cheaply made in person. 
as for sizing, i ordered the 2p based on other reviewers' comments about it running small. the 2p fit me fine, although it was very fitted in the chest and i am very small chested #32b#. i can definitely see that being an issue"
1,"Will be your favorite tee This tee is super comfortable. it feels and looks like a well worn favorite right off the rack. although it only comes in s-m-l sizes and i wear an xs ( 32a/b, 105 lbs) the small fits well. no gaping armhoes to worry about. the pics don't show that the tee does trapeze out somewhat but it is not to worry about. i purchased the reddish color which is a wonderful faded maroon shade. i will be getting the black one as well."
1,Summer perfection! I'm so in love with this skirt. i sized up to a 4 (i'm typically a 2 in maeve) and it's pure perfection. i had to steam it after getting home from the store because it wrinkled up pretty quickly. wore it with my copper birks and a chambray top but i can see this being dressed up for work as well. took off a star due to his easily it wrinkled.
1," I love this shirt. it's different than other summer tops. it's pretty much as pictured in terms of color and size, and runs true to size. on a windy day the front will come open, but only to your stomach."
0,"Neck The dress is pretty, i ordered a 4 and 6 not knowing how it ran, i took both back the neck is too tight!"
1," I just received this dress in petite extra small. for reference, i am 5""7 and 118 pounds. to answer the previous reviewer's question, the regular size of this dress runs long. if you want it to look like the one in the video, then order it in petite. i personally love the style and the material. however, the inside slip is very short with the petite given my height but this can be solved by adding a half slip underneath it."
1,"On the fence I'm just not sure about this top... it's very short. i'm short-waisted, and it could stand to be at least an inch longer in front for me. and as another reviewer pointed out, there's no closure in front. i can't imagine wearing it without a tank underneath... one good stiff breeze and everyone would get a peep show. it really seems more like a vest than a shirt. it's cute enough with a tank underneath, but that sort of defeats the purpose of an easy summer top... it's too hot for layers in the s"
1,"Sweet summer patterns Love the pattern play on this skirt! i had to size up to a 6 (i usually take a 2 or 4 in skirts) as it was too snug in the hips/waist. going up a size worked well and the hem hit me at the knee (i'm 5' 6""). thought it looked cute with the cloth & stone chambray tank :)"
1,"Looooove!! I normally don't write reviews for clothing but this dress warrants an exception.

i am a little over six months pregnant and have a shotgun wedding at city hall in a couple of weeks. with a limited amount of time to plan, i bought a bunch of pregnant wedding dresses online and rented the runway, to arrive just before the actual ceremony. out of curiosity, i walked into retailer today to see if they had any white or ivory dresses that would look cute and city hall wedding-ish. they did! so i too"
1,"I liked it but didn't keep I love all of these dresses, ordered the ivory in 00p on accident, meant to order 0p. was too small, but 0p would have fit. it is flattering, the pattern of lace is great, but i didn't like the color as much in person. i think i would like the blue better."
1,"Flattering This dress is made with stretchy cottony fabric, yet, very forgiving. it fits like a glove but doesn't show bulges. fit is perfect, i had originally purchased the white and grey, but the petite length is better. too bad as i do love me some red. oh well."
1,"Surprised by other comments about size/bust 5""5', 130, 32dd. i saw this dress online and thought it was beautiful, but considered not buying it because of other comments that the bust was too small for women with more curves. fortunately, the lovely blue dress was in my local retailer store and i decided to try it on in a size 4. i think the dress fits perfectly and i have gotten many compliments, including from random strangers. i have had no problem with a tight zipper or a low back, which is perfectly able to cover my bra in the back. th"
1,Small in bust I ordered this dress in the blue color. it is lovely in person - but the petite seemed to run smaller than most petite dresses i buy from retailer. i ordered a 2p - and it was tight in the bust on me. i imagine a 4p would be perfect. i am 117 5'3 34b.
1,"Gorgeous dress Online this dress caught my eye but the reviews seemed to indicate there was something weird with the length so i did not want to order it online and have to send it back etc...because i am 5'5"" and did not know weather to get the petite or the regular! my local store had it and i bought a regular small and it is not too long. it comes just to the ground in the back like any other maxi. it is super comfortable and gorgeous! i am not sure where i am going in it yet....but it was just too pretty o"
1,"This is a gorgeous dress. the blue is beautiful The fitted top and flared skirt are really nice on this piece. i am 5'6"" 125lb and i took a 6. a 4 might have been ok, but i felt more comfortable in the 6, and it had a really nice fit.

the quality is good, but there were some areas that were starting to pull and the floral details come a little frayed around the cutout edges, so i'm not sure how it will wear."
0," The length of this dress is bizarre.  i can't decide if it's supposed to lay on the floor or not touch it at all - i'm not sure if i like it either way.  also- at this price point, i would have hoped to have the included under layer to not be so transparent.  if you buy this dress, be prepared to invest in a slip and then have the slip tailored to match the high low hem line so that people cannot see your underwear.  the netting and details in this dress are beautiful but delicate- the one i pur"
1,Vibrant colors Skirt is made well and beautiful colors. runs a tad small. i am typically a 4/6 and i ordered the 8 (based on other reviews) and it fit well.
1,"Beautiful dress! I specifically bought this dress for my bridal shower and loved it! i'm small on top and have hips that don't lie. i purchased the size 2 petite. the waist portion of the dress came up a little higher which was ok since it fell at a small part of my waist. the length was just above my knee, which i prefer. the dress has a nude lining which compliments my tan skin tone. i wore a regular nude bra that didn't show beneath the liner. i received many compliments and would highly recommend it.

1,"Makes me feel feminine I feel in love with the dress when i saw it hanging at the store. usually, i feel bailey 44 dresses make my body look really round and short. i've passed up a few because i didn't find them too flattering. i almost even just passed this one up because of my past experiences, but i tried it on and felt like i had the body of another person! it hugged my body very nicely and i felt like it gave me a shape! i also saw all the possibilities it had. the store had it styled with a denim jacket. i can"
1,Great skirt This skirt is adorable. there is no give to it though. i usually wear a 4/6 and got the 4 and i can't gain a pound or it won't zip. it is perfect for spring and summer. i'm 5'8 135.
1,"Flattering but not for work This dress was as pretty in real life as the picture. flattering also. unfortunately it is definitely not appropriate for office work. even though it appears so in the picture, the back is very low cut and there is no way not for bra to show (unless you don't need one) also it was much tighter on top than the model picture, even though the rest fit perfectly."
1,"What's with the length? So i haven't actually tried this and i'm sorry for the misleading star rating. i just wanted to get someone's attention on the length. the photos show the dress draping with almost a train even with the model in platform heels but in the video, the dress is about 2 inches off the floor. is it the model in the video that is extra tall? someone help me out. this looks gorgeous but since it's an online exclusive, i won't be able to try it on at the store."
1,Fun summer skirt This skirt caught my eyes right away in the clearance section. i would have tried size 2 but it wasn't available. however size 4 fitted just fine. the print has bright summery feel to it. the lines on skirt are more carrot orange than it is to red. fabric is soft.
1," I love this designer so i grabbed at this shirt immediately. unlike their other items, this shirt is linen. it's a great cut and very flattering once you iron it. the only problem i found was that as i wore it throughout the day, she shirt became wrinkled and misshapen to the point where it ballooned out around my stomach."
1,"Elegant & unique fabric I find it very difficult to find office friendly yet unique designs and feel this one fits the bill and also has the ability to be dressed up for the evening. i am ""curvy on bottom"" so i sized up from my normal retailer 4 to a 6 and surprisingly the dress fit my hips just fine. i'm 5'8"" 140 about 36-27-36 if it helps as i know it's hard to determine sometimes if this style will fit a more curvy figure...my advice is to go up a size if you are. the fabric i found true to the photo and the emerald i"
1,"Beautiful dress, cheap components This dress is stunning, no doubt - a shimmering forest green under a black teardrop motif, thick material, nicely cut, with pocket panels that are forgiving to a belly. however, the fact that this dress has zero stretch (which is fine, if that's what you're looking for), coupled with what is quite possibly the cheapest zipper ever manufactured, make this dress exhausting to put on. i'm normally a 14/16 at retailer, and i ordered the 16 just to be safe, and the waist is exactly the size of my waist"
1,"Beautiful skirt I read the other reviews on this skirt and tried the 4 and the 6 (i'm between the two sizes, typically) in case it ran small. technically it does. the 4 is tighter, but it looks better sitting higher on my waist. the 6 is looser, but doesn't look as good. likely sticking with the 4. the colors are gorgeous and the fabric is light and high quality. it can be dressed up or down."
1,"Delicate and beautiful I've been looking for a dress to wear to wedding this summer, and this is it. the blue color is lovely and the lace overlay is feminine and pretty. i'm small busted (34aa) with an athletic lower body (think, 120-lb marathoner), and the flare of this dress is perfect. i ordered this in a 0 and a 0 petite. the petite size looked little-girl short; the regular size hit just at my knee and was much more sophisticated. the waistband also fell at a more flattering place in the regular dress. i'm on th"
1,"Fun skirt with a little twist I bought this skirt for an end of summer ""caribbean"" party. the floral detail is even more fun in person. it looks great with a red top or black tank."
1,"Runs small I ordered this dress to possibly wear to my wedding rehearsal dinner. i an adding this review to give some guidance on sizing. i am size 34a and own two other dresses by this designer in size 2. for this dress, however, i had to size up to a 4 in order to close the side zip. i'm 5'7"" and the dress hit me just above the knee. (in my opinion, it would have been more elegant if it was a little longer.) the color combo with the taupe and off white is unique, but wasn't particularly flattering on my"

1,Beautiful lace dress - size up I love this dress's gentle blue lace. the silhouette is just as seen in the pictures. i found the dress tight in the chest and had to size up one size (6 to 8).
1,Awesome fit and texture The dress looks even better in person. the fabric is very delicate though but worth the extra care it needs. the fit was perfect and the color is just as in the picture.
1,"Very elegant! I wore this top right out of the package i loved it so much. i am 5'8"" small busted and size 4 was great. the sleeves hit me perfectly. the pleated detail in the back is flattering as well. my daughter now wants her own top. it would be nice to have a second color option."
0,Nice to look at Top opens in the middle right in front. should have some sort of closure inside to prevent this top from flying open will return
0,"Great concept, poor execution The dress at first glance is pretty, feminine, and a timeless shape. sadly the quality just isn't there.  i ordered online and was excited trying it on (dress fit true to size for me, all be it a little snug in the chest).  the zipper is super cheap, hard to get up or down on or off the hanger.  the appliqu茫漏s are sewn onto a super flimsy netting, already coming detached without even having worn it.  i could see this dress catching on ""everything"" and tearing easily.  given the quality i'm return"
1,Beautiful Flattering fitted form. flowing fabric. well made. colors are true to pictures.
1,Love it! Very pretty dress! wearing it for a family beach portrait. it may run a little big but not terribly. it is also not super long as pictured. i'm 5'6 and it's perfect with a flat.
1,"Stunning This one is a beauty! my store is not carrying the white - they had a lovely blue (periwinkle-ish) that immediately caught my eye. the ivory model shot makes the details of the lace and top layer really pop - more so than the blue variety but both are stunning. the details and layers on this dress are lovely and intricate without feeling overly delicate. quality most definitely in line with the price.

1," I love this top. i'm not one to iron, so i wash (and hang dry) and wear it. great with skinny jeans."
0,"Great idea poorly executed I wanted to love this dress, but it has too many flaws. first, the ""waistband"" falls right under the bust and the skirt flares out from there. not a flattering silhouette.. second, the fabric is a sickly yellow-beige netting that looks like burlap. third, i can't imagine what kind of bra you can wear under it. on the plus side, the fabric isn't scratchy."
1,"Great cover up This cover up is precious. i ordered both sizes because i was unsure of how either would fit since there was only a s/m and m/l. there is not a whole lot of variation between the two. i wear a size 10 pants and the s/m fit, but i may still keep the m/l instead for fear that it may shrink when washed. the garment is hand wash only which i will do because of the delicacy of the tassels. that's a little high maintenance for a cover up but i am willing to do it because it really is a cute cover up."

1,"So soft, thin knit In the photo, this looks like a heavy knit top, but it's not. the fabric is very light, thin, and soft. it's like a knit nightgown material. i said this runs big b ecause i'm normally a size xl and i can wear this. it actually fits me a little less flowy than on the model and i think looks better. so, to me, you can size down if you want this not to have so much flowing fabric.

0," This dress is so short! i double checked to make sure i didn't get a petite by mistake.  i'm 5'10 and ordered an extra small because of the deep v neck. it fit well on top, but  you could see my underwear in the front. seriously, i dont even think miley cirus would wear it that short. the lace was really beautiful so i was disappointed that it didn't work out."
1," Really cute dress. i bought the white. i am usually a size 2 in retailer dresses but i could not even zip this! side zip was also slightly awkward. had to return, waiting for the 4."
1,"Simply timeless and feminine I bough this dress in blue and i cannot tell you the compliments and the looks i get on the street! no kidding! this is a beautiful dress which has a very feminine/romantic quality to it. i bought size 4 and it sits perfectly on my waist i completely fell in love with that dress and especially with the lace work and the design. this is a classic piece, that is always going to be timeless in my opinion. no regret at all to have bought it!"
0,High hopes are dashed! I wanted to love this top -- looks so comfy and cute. but hangs like a bag. going back!
1,"Nice summer dress I knew the ivory color was online only so i tried the blue one for size and i couldn't believe how nice the blue one is. i ended up buying it. i purchased a size bigger because mine wasn't available but because of lace and side zip, it still doesn't look huge. if i find my size in another store i can always exchange, but i couldn't leave the dress behind."
1,"Oh so soft! This cozy sweater has the feel of cashmere. it fits loose and has a similar look as a wrap or poncho. looks better over sleeveless or short sleeve tops. i'm surprised it isn't one size fits all b/c it is very generous in the xs/s, which i got and i'm a 6. i can see wearing this all year long, even summer cool nights. very classic style. the picture on website looks frumpy to me, but on it is very flattering."
1,"Everyone needs this top! I am a short frame with broad shoulders and a large chest which means peplum tops typically look horribly unflattering on my frame. not this top! the cut is very flattering due to the lower peplum. not too much fabric to add to the waistline, truly a perfect fit. if this top came in any other colors, i would buy them all."
1, Wonderful colors and fit tts. love the style. can were on or off the shoulders . love it!!!

First i found the picture of this blouse stunning because the colors caught my attention . with that said, i found myself thinking of all the many events this could worn to, dressed up or down. so.... i found myself ordering it asap, paranoid that others were thinking i was thinking the same thing. well , i received it in the mail , and it was better than i thought!!! the colors and cut of this blouse is just as in the picture. i personally love this article/pattern of art, as i see it as an exp"
1, I love the way this fits and feels on. it is a beautiful piece and makes me happy to wear. i ordered my usual size medium and it fits well. the only con is that it is dry clean only.
1,"Great look all in one I love everything about this sweater. it is very well made, beautiful material and such an effortless way to pull it all together. it runs large which was unfortunate for me as i bought the xs petite and i really need xxs in this one, but none are left. i am 5 ft. tall and weigh about 96 pounds. i can wear a 0 but not in this sweater. it runs very well and i highly recommend it. hope they make more in this style. it is so fresh looking and so comfortable."
1,Love! I love everything bordeaux so when i saw this one i knew i needed to try it and it's my favorite top from this brand ever. i hope they keep the style and offer it in all of the colors going forward. it's a very flattering style for anyone - accentuates shape without being tight or clingy and the stripes are lovely. also the material is so soft. i have not washed it yet so i hope it stands up to wash and wear well. overall this is an amazing top. it runs slightly large. i'm usually an xs in tops
1,"So much prettier than pictured! I agree with the previous review, i too would not have purchased it if i had not tried it in the store (which is 2 hrs from my house!). the colors are much more saturated but not gaudy. the caveat, it is quite short. i am 5'10"", 135 lbs. i purchased a medium as it gave me the length i needed."
1," I'm so thrilled with these! the fabric is a little heavier, and they just fit really well when similar styles tend to be baggy."
1,"Flirty and fun I am 5'5"", 145 lbs, a cup. depending on the style of the shirt i am between a medium and a small at retailer, in this case i purchased a small. even in the small the body has ample space which adds to the relax look without appearing sloppy. and because the shirt is wider i would say you can easily size down. the shirt is definitely flirty and fun with a great print, and easy to wear off of the shoulders. i invested in another retailer top that is also an ""off of the shoulder"" design but it does not"
1,"Didn't try petite The heart version is very pretty, i can't speak for the striped one as i have not seen that one in person. i ordered the xxs after trying on the xs, as i felt the petite would be perhaps too short. the xs was a little big on me. the only problem with xxs regular is the sleeves are longer on me, like 3/4 length, not to elbow as shown on model. but i don't want the shirt to be too short so sticking with that size.

for reference, i am 115 lbs, 30dd chest, 26.5 in waist, and short."
1,"Long sleeves Very soft, first thing i have to say, but runs a little big, especially in the sleeves, i ordered the xxs p and the sleeves still bunch a lot at the wrists. also, other bummer is how sheer the ivory fabric is, i wish it had more substance for the price. but, i like the style and color combo. classic look, effortless, and can be paired with so many things. the regular size neckline was too low for me. the length on the petite was fine, not too short. so i say it runs big.

for reference, i am 1"
1,"Attractive and good quality, but runs large I love the look and feel of these shorts - typically my issue with any sort of cotton or linen shorts these days is that they're practically made of nothing, but these are comfortable and made of decent fabric. however, they run very large. being 100 lbs and about 5', i typically buy size 0 or xs, but these looked a bit ridiculous on me, with how big they are. i tried shrinking them in the wash, since they're 100% cotton, and that helped some, along with getting rid of the creases from shipping"
1,"Surprisingly sweet Truthfully, i wouldn't have looked twice at this shirt online. i came across it at my local retailer store and i'm so glad i did. the colors are more vivid and beautiful in person. i purchased the small (my normal size) and it hits at the waist."
1,"So pretty in person! I agree completely with the previous reviews suggesting that this top is much prettier in person! i failed to notice this top online, but was drawn to it in the store (the green color). it is perfect for early fall weather. although i could probably wear the xs, i ordered the xxs online after trying on the xs because i wanted it to be a bit shorter and have less extra fabric in hopes that it would be just that much more flattering."
1, This is the second tulle skirt by bailey 44 that i have bought. the color is a little more grey blue than the picture online but the quality is excellent. i am normally a size 6 and i purchased this skirt in medium and fits fine. it is a pull-on skirt but the waistband doesn't have a lot of stretch to it.
1,"Great style! I love any bow tie tops but most have the bow too high up which looks dowdy. i love the layered look and the contrasting colors. i am 100 lbs, 5'3"" and got the regular xs. i wanted the petite xs but it was sold out unfortunately. the regular was a little too big but it still works! looks great with jeans or dress pants....even a skirt! very versatile and classy and creative styling."
1,"Fun retro fabric The sweater is comfortable and has a little 70s fabric flair...not quite as classically modern as it looks on the model. i am keeping it because it is a true fall/spring item. not a fabric weight for summer wear in california. the peach color is pretty muted, so it is not a show-stopping going-out piece."
0," Looks great on the model, but if you're curvy it looks very frumpy."
1,"Great dress, but better if you are not busty I love this dress, but i am 5'7"" and a size 12, so am a bit curvy. this dress was great on the bottom, but the way that he did the top of it made me look even more busty than i am. i returned it for that reason. however, if he would make that ""skirt"" as a stand alone, i would buy in a second."
1,"A girl and a pretty skirt... This skirt is perfect. i'm a size 10 and i'm 48 years old. i've really been wanting a tulle skirt, but didn't want to look like baby huey in it a bip puffy tutu above my knees. this skirt is indicative of the quality that is bailley 44. the fit is great, the length is perfect. i plan to wear it with a chambray shirt and the burgundy colored obi belt."
1,"Elegant! It was love at first sight when i saw this dress online. the color, cut and delicate details are perfectly balanced with a moderately sexy neckline! ladylike with a little attitude. the fabric is gorgeous and is a stunning shade of midnight blue. this dress is perfect for a summer beach party or to attend a wedding. cut is extremely flattering, and the halter tie top allows for adjustment for a perfect fit. 
i just received it today, and it is a must have for any closet. 
tried it on with a be"
1,"Love it! This is a beautiful dress with so many interesting textures and colors. it is form-fitting yet modest enough to wear for so many occasions - i plan to wear it for my son's graduation, but i think there are many potential uses for this dress. be aware that, like many byron lars sheath dresses, the bottom part is very tight- makes it hard to fit for more pear-shaped people. the top is a tad loose on me while the bottom is quite snug. however if i go up or down a size it will be too big on top or t"
1,"Pretty and comfortable Goes well with lots of skirts and pants, including the culottes shown. only downside, and not a big one, the sleeves are finished with elastic instead of a fabric band, which looks a little cheap"
1,"Beautiful classic Could not let it pass at a sale price. got the 0p and its a bit snug on the waist (25 waist, 34a, 102lbs) otherwise its perfect. will keep the size. dress hits me just above knee like in the picture. its beautiful in person. the details, the quality, the flattering fit...perfect"
1,"Just buy it Soft, comfortable, flattering, versatile--what more can you ask for? just wish it came in a long-sleeved version."
1,"Great for junk in the trunk I am 5'7 and 125lbs w a muscular bubble butt from climbing and biking. usually have trouble w shorts fitting right because my legs and waist don't match my butt. these shorts run large , i got a medium which should have been okay but they stretched out quite a bit after one wear so am returning for a small. it's crazy for my butt to be in a ""small""anything. so- if you are a skinny minny, or have a flat butt, these may not work for you in that you don't have anything to hold these up besides the"
1,"Beyond basic Love, love, love this top. i want to wear it every day! not only is it striped, which is super chic, but also, the peplum hits lower so it really accentuates your waistline (in a good way!). plus, its soft, like so many wonderul bordeaux tops are. i wish they had this is solid colors because i'd buy them all. for reference, i bounce between an xs and s at retailer, more along the lines of s...and i got the xs in this and it still has room (5'7, 135 lbs, 34a/b chest)."
1,"This dress make me laugh I always chuckle when i see this dress because it looks so busy and so crazy with all the mixed prints, i think it's a lot of fun. not so fun to put on, but it's worth the trouble. i swear my shoulders are sore after manipulating this on myself. i also own the mona dress in 8p, but i had to size down to a 6 for the melodist because the hips were not fitted enough and the back bloused out too much."
1,Love this shirt I love this top. it looks as great in person as it does on-line. it does require some adjustment while wearing because it slips up onto the shoulders more than i prefer. the quality is nice and it is very pretty. it is great with skinny jeans and heels for a fall look.
1,"Quirky & stylish silk shirt I must admit that i was a little hesitant to try this top on, largely due to my shape.
fyi: broad shoulders/back, 36c, short waist, 5'3"" 
typical size: dress or button-down shirt 12, knit or not fitted top, m
i purchased the heart design in a size m, since the upper part of the shirt is oversized a little bit (not too big and baggy, though) and then narrowis to the waist. think ""upside-down triangle"", as the shape of the top. since this is also my shape on top (6 on bottom), i worried that th"
1,"Feminine & fun Bypassed this blouse online, but it's striking colors caught my eye at the store. bought the olive green color and it's gorgeous! the color is great for both spring and fall. i'm normally a petite xs at 5'0 feet and 104 pounds, the regular xs is a great fit for me. not too boxy and the length hits right at my waist. material is lighweight and flowey. don't hesitate to buy, it's a great piece to add some pop of color and goes great with skinny jeans.."
1,"Fall must have Beautiful fall colors, perfect with work pants or jeans. i'm tall and was a little worried it would be too short, but it was a good fit."
1,"Adorable This is a really cute top. it's boxy but it's cotton eyelet so you shouldn't expect form fitting. if you are in between sizes order a size down. i'm a 36 ddd and usually have to wear large with retailer brands, however, the medium fit fine, it doesn't pull in the back or shoulders. the cotton material is thick enough that you don't have to wear a cami underneath if you don't want to. it's also long enough that your stomach won't show through the bottom eyelet band."
1,"Cute go to for fall Really like this shirt. easy to throw on with jeans (black if you don't like the denim on denim). flattering without making you look boxy. arms are roomy too, unlike the what the picture shows."
0,"Baggy and shapeless This shirt is not awful but not anything pretty. there's a reason the main photo has the model with her arms crossed over the waist! it runs good on top and then you get to the body of the garment and it runs straight down yet the pleats even make it manage to expand a little but then you get to the lovely detailed hem which reins them in. so now you are left with a bit of a poof effect making you rounder in all the wrong ways. it's one of those, ""i'm too lazy to send it back it's not that awful"
1,"So cozy This swing tee is amazing! i bought the blue one and the color is true to what it looks like online. the material is so soft and cozy. i am typically an xs and bought an xs, however it runs ever so slightly big. if i had purchased the xxs, it seems like the arms would have been to tight and i'm definitely not a fan of that. whatever the case, i highly recommend this tshirt and love its versatility and that i can wear this all year long."
1," Love this top!! i bought it for school and im dying to wear it. i could see how other people could dislike it bc of the loose frame, but if you like flowy shirts this top is for you! i like how the shirt is made of a really soft and sturdy cotton and the top part is more fitted so the fabric doesnt completely drown you out. also, this top looks super cute paired w/ a bralette and espadrilles!"
0,"Disappointing blouse This looked like a simple, chic blouse, but the fabric felt cheap to me, like thin lining fabric. the neckline is too deep and wide as well and so not flattering."
1, Beautiful shirt but runs huge! usually between a large or xl and i sized down to a medium.   the fabric has a nice sheen and it's a flowy shirt but seriously size down.
1,Comfy and pretty I bought this in red and wear it a lot. it is so soft and comfortable! i love all the fabric and the design. the longer sleeve length is amazing! it is a perfect tee! you can tell from the pics there's a lot a fabric and it's supposed to be loose and drape like that. it fits like in the pics and is true to size. wear a tank underneath in case there's a strong wind.
0,"Huge, long and baggy This blouse is quite stiff. i wouldn't mind the boxiness if this blouse weren't so long. even if you size down, because of the eyelet and the cute hem, it would be difficult to shorten this blouse to fit."
1,"Yes yes a million times yes! I am a sucker for a good swing top. i own many styles from retailer and similar retailers. i carry my weight in my stomach butt and hips, so this style is always good for me. as soon as i saw this online i fell hard and waited patiently for it to arrive at my store. finally it did! i love this top. its very swingy. almost cut like a circle so there is tons of room in the body. the sleeve is more fitted, but my arms are larger so it might just be fitted for me. there is a bit of stretch to it. the"
0, I get that it's a swing style top and supposed to be loose but it looked so much bigger on me than on the model and just not flattering at all.
1,"Simple and pretty I love this blouse, it looks great under a blazer dressed up and great with boyfriend jeans.
it is loose and flowy, the neck line is low. i bought a medium and it is a little large but fits with the style of the top.
i happen to love the fabric, it is soft and feels great on the skin. one of my favorite fabric combinations is rayon (viscose) and cotton."
1, Awesome shirt...great transition into fall. somewhat sheer. extremely comfortable!
0,"What a mess! This top is crazy in the front and just way-off when it comes to a cross-over drape. the top did not lay flat and the drape over has one snap which seemed to ""bloop"" open constantly. the bottom in the front is a strange combination of layers that i couldn't get to look good.

i'm busty, but this isn't the reason this blouse is just a disaster of a fit on me. the blouse fits tts and everything was covered, so it's not like it was too small and tugged. that's not the case. this blouse just didn't"
1,"Comfortably free in beautiful hues. This is the second top i have purchased in this design, the first being in the navy blue color. i loved the effortless swing of this shirt and the comfortable cotton texture, that i chose to purchase it in wine and have since received many compliments on both the shape and color. this is an easy top for me to put on and feel good within."
0,"Runs small Normally wear a medium in most retailer tops (5'9"", 150lbs).  would probably need an xl to fit more like a tunic.  right now, in the medium, fits more like a tiny shirt, but more for fitting.  arms are also tighter than i expected.  will be returning."
1,"Great swing top Love this top. yes it is a swing top so you have to be prepared for the extra fabric. fits true to size thru the shoulders and chest. body of the top then flares for the ""swing"" effect. great top. plan on ordering it in the other colors."
0,"This is huge! If you're pregnant, congratulations. this shirt is for you. if you've ever dreamed of being an xxs, this shirt is also for you. i'm a 34d, normally a small or medium, but often size down to xs in swing tops. the xs is ginormous on me, although it fits through the shoulders. i can hold onto the bottom and stretch my arms straight out at the sides, it's that wide. think flying squirrel. what doesn't show in the pictures is that it also has a slight dolman sleeve, which makes it look wide at the to"
0,Not flattering Didn't like the dress. look pregnant in it. this dress is going back.
1,Vegan leather Love these vegan leather pants. the fit is great for my petite frame. i bought them in regular size because the petite sold out so fast. i just got them hemmed of course. i love the fit but i also loved the color. the green was a just a little bit different and took me away from the basic black
1,"Cute shirt, runs small I ordered my regular size l in black. i loved the fabric and finish on the neckline. i feel that in order to have the loose look as on the model, i would have to size up to xl. i might reorder it in xl, but really, it is a hassle and will most likely wait until another free shipping promotion.

runs a bit short in my opinion too. maybe the larger size will have a bit more length."
1,Will get you noticed! The first day i wore this dress to work i was amazed by how many people commented on it! i knew i liked it but apparently so does everyone else!
1,"Cool weather comfort This is the perfect cool day, cozy, teacher sort of sweater or if you're having a mr rogers sort of day. the material is soft and comfortable and the color is just as it appears in the photo. looks great with a button down shirt underneath."
0,"Look like ""mom jeans"" Maybe i just have the wrong body type for these jeans, but even though they technically fit, i felt like they looked like ""mom jeans"" on me. i was fine with the high waist, which actually made them very comfortable, but the ankles were loose and long on me, where most ag ankle jeans are a perfect length. the quality is good though--the fabric is substantial and a bit stiffer than most of my other ag's, and the color is a nice saturated black. i tried on a size 27, and i'm 5'4"", 120 lbs."
0,"Fits like a bag :( I was stoked to get this dress, and it is truly beautiful, but the fit is so awful. it was like being swallowed up by a bag. i ordered my usual size 6; i'm 5'7"" 140 lbs, and a bra size 34dd, but the dress just fell on me like a sack. i was so disappointed!! had to return."
0,"Boxy The fit of this top on me was much more boxy than on the model, maybe the fault of my fuller bust. my usual small definitely didn't reach my hips as it does hers, and appears wider. i'm not even sure the v is as deep! again, could be me. but i'm keeping the top because it is just so darn comfortable. as for not looking too top-heavy, ill just have to make it work."
1," I love this t-shirt. i fabric is soft yet has a nice weight to it. it is comfortable, yet sexy."
1,Cute and comfy casual dress. I like the red color and the border detail at the neckline. i'm not crazy about the way the zipper on the back is emphasized. i'd rather have a less visible zipper. overall it is a cute and comfortable dress. the fabric is soft and substantial and has a nice texture to it. the shape is basic so it can be dressed up or down.
1,"Nice style, but had some issues... I love the contemporary style of this piece, but i returned it because the side slits were too high even for a short person like me (5'1""). but if you don't mind showing a little skin at the waist when you raise your arms, it might work for you. the fabric has a nice texture and the muted colors would mix well with other pieces."
1, Beautiful dress. when you look at it on the hanger you think this could be really good or really bad. but it is absolutely beautiful. would highly recommend it - can dress it up or down.
1,"Love this dress! I bought this dress in the red option. was a little concerned when i read other reviews that said it looked like a maternity dress, but it didn't look like that on me at all. it falls nicely and fits me well - i am 5 ft, 107 lbs - in size xs. love the details at the neckline and hem. will be looking out for other dresses by maeve!"
1,"Great dress for the right body type. There is so much i love about this dress. like many of the other reviewers i simply love the fabric. it's soft and comfy but has texture and interest at the same time. there's beautiful detail to it as well. the edging at the neckline and hemline are unfinished and beautifully so. having said all that, i like many other reviewers i just don't have the body type to pull it off. there wasn't one angle that didn't make me look even bigger than i am. the pleating in the front, while very cute, gave"
1,"Comfortable Very comfy with cotton and lots of stretch. can be dressed up or down. i wear it with blue denim jacket and also with cream cardi. 5'4"" 135# and the small is perfect."
1,"Cute and modern I like this dress because it's the perfect shape on me and i think the design is modern and cute. i got the red and i really like the pattern and the subtle tulle edging. the material is a little stretchy and substantial and there's also a lining. i wore it with little booties like the model and tights and a cropped moto jacket and loved the outfit. i am short, small chest, but somewhat broad shouldered, the empire waist would not work on larger chested women with hourglass figures."
0,"I don't understand this dress I have been continually disappointed in retailer's clothing for the past year. i feel like their prices have soared and the quality has remained so-so, but dresses like these somehow make the cut. it does not make sense. since when did retailer exclusively market to older women? no, retailer's market has always been young adults. this dress is extremely matronly. although the bottom print is nice, the hot pink belt?? is completely mismatched and gaudy. i really hope retailer starts curating better dress"
1,"Comfortable and classy Can't say enough about this cute dress....i bought it in red/ which is more of a burgundy, and paired it with a pair of over the knee burgundy boots. i can see wearing this in the spring, summer; heck, all year round! quality is nice and the gold zipper down the top of the back is a classy touch. don't pass this one up!"
1,"Simple beauty Purchased this in the wine color and love it! the detail at the neck at the bottom hem gives it an extra flair. i went with a small so that it was more fitted. love that it is stylish and comfortable. paired with knee high boots given it length but could also work well with short boots, like the photo."
1,Comfy and versatile I ordered this in black and in the print and i am super happy with both. the fabric is very soft. i've worn it with denim and khaki shorts as well as with a cute skirt for work. very versatile.
1,Awesome pants! I tried these on when they were full price and waited for them to go on sale and was very excited when they did! i'm not the type to buy leather pants but these look like i can dress them up or down and dress them like jeans. i'm a size 26 in pants but i bought size 25. i highly recommend!
0,"Had high hopes This dress was a disappointment. not black, but brown. and it was very oddly made, with a weird, seam right across the belly. on its way back..."
1,"Freestyle crop tank I had to keep rechecking the price tag on this one to be sure i saw it correctly. price aside though, it's really awesome. fit is flattering, stripes are cute, colors are nice, and you can wear it all summer long. if you can get over the dollar signs, it's a keeper!"
1, Beautiful embroidery and good quality jeans. you can really dress up with these for special occassion.
1,"Love, love, love!!!!! These are great pants, have them in the green holly color"
1,"Must get These jeans are pricey and worth every dollar.  fits in the right area and makes your butt look perfect.  ladies, if you have thick legs...these jean are meant for you."
1,"Great dress to dress up or down - runs big I usually find maeve to run tts, but i sized down in this. i am normally a 6p and got an xs regular (to make the length more work-appropriate). i think a larger size emphasized the extra room at the front tucks - making it look a little maternity-like.

it is very flattering on - drapes nicely. i got the cranberry color for the holidays and will wear in with wine tights and light taupe over the knee suede boots!"
0,Ehhhh.... Looks so beautiful.... on a hanger. does not really do anything on a person. beautiful beading but the dress on is very sack-like. i will be returning it
1,Great dress! The photos do not do this dress justice. i loved it as soon as i tried it on! it is good quality and the fabric is not too thin. definitely recommend!
0,"Short torso and static cling problem This top is pretty and i'm sad it didn't work out for me. i'm 5'9, 145 lbs and i found it to be short and boxy in the torso (tried on a s, m and l). also material in the front is super staticky - i hate that feeling."
1,"Love this dress! I love dolan dresses! the fabrics are always beautiful, and the colors are always unique. i usually wear an xs petite in dolan, but i ordered both the xs and the xs petite, and i think i'm going to keep the xs. i had a hard time deciding which to keep, but the xs petite was just a hair too short. i think this is a versatile dress for all seasons. you could pair it with tights in fall/winter, but it is great for spring/summer, too..."
1,"I like These are thicker and don't have as much stretch, needed to go up from my usual 26 to a 27. good for late summer to fall transition due to the wash."
1,My kind of dress I like dresses with sleeves as those are more appropriate for work for me. this dress is a smooth material and the asymmetrical bottom adds just a little extra something. i got it in my normal size and i do find it looser/not meant to be body hugging again making it work appropriate.
1,"Gorgeous! I love this skirt!! it slips seamlessly from day to night, and looks great on those of us who happen to be on the taller side. it's super warm, so it's perfect with tights and boots on those colder winter evenings out."
1,"Love this skirt! Great length, very comfortable, very pretty. perfect dressy winter skirt!"
1,"Cute and comfy! I ordered a medium as the large in the store was a bit too big. i wore this dress to a casual dinner at the grill in the country club and felt so cute, but also comfortable. i think it is a flattering dress shape and fabric. looks just like pictured on your website."
1,"Lovely material, bit boxy I really love this dress. the material has a lovely feel to the skin, silky. i typically wear a large (occasionally a medium). if i wanted this dress to look like the model it would be the large. i ended up going with a medium because i wanted to accentuate the smallest part of me (rib cage area). this made the black portion a tad snug around the bum, but it eased a bit with wear (but still tighter than model picture)
size down if you want it snug, normal size for a looser, boxier fit. either w"
0,"Love the look, not the fit! I love the look and fabric of this skirt. it also falls at a very nice, flattering length around the knee. what did not work for me was the waist. the stretchy waist looked cheap, and i do not have a flat stomach, so it made me look like i have a muffin top! i bet it would look great if you have a flat stomach."
1,"The it dress This dress by dolan is my go to favorite for work. it gives a polished look with a pair of booties.i purchased it in an xs. i'm 5'1 and c-d cup. fit me perfectly. i can't wait to team it up with a sweater for chillier fall days. you will get a ton of compliments with this dress. love, love , love."
1,"Great dress! I immediatley bought this adorable dress after trying it on at my local retailer and absolutely love it! it fits tts for me in my regular size small (34d-27-35) and it's incredibly soft and comfortable to wear. the top portion is so great as it has nice short sleeves, the color is a nice deep, rich orange which looks great now in the summer but will look especially cute in the fall with tall boots and a light denim jacket plus the bottom half is cut in such an interesting way. the material is amaz"
1,"The perfect white shirt I have been needing a perfect go-to white tee for layering purposes and this one met and exceeded my expectations. it's the perfect weight for year-round use, love that it's 3/4 sleeves (again great for year round), and the slight front v adds a nice special touch. fell in love with the first one i bought online, so ordered a second for backup. it's a winner (and great price)!"
1,"Easy to wear Very comfortable dress and cool for our hot summers. i ordered in my normal size medium. neckline is cut a little low, but not enough to change my mind on the purchase."
0,Cute but no This shirt ran small and was more sheer than i expected. had to send it back.
0,"Like the idea Like the idea of this longer tee/tunic to wear with leggings but i found it not flowly enough in my regular retailer size ( small). fit on top but not really on the bottom with the side slits. unflattering how the slits hit me. maybe for some one taller ( i am 5'3"")."
1,Versatile and comfortable dress I loved this dress so much i got it in two colors. the colors match the picture online. it's very soft and will work for summer and fall.
1,"Comfortable and sexy I have an hourglass shape, so this skirt is winner for me. classic a-line fit but with a modern hem. it's subtly shiny, very stylish, and comfortable. paired with a tight shirt and heels it looks extremely sexy. a sale price makes it all the sweeter."
1,Perfect fall dress! I love this dress! it's so comfortable and perfect for the summer fall transition. it fits true to size and isn't to boxy or tight. i love the colors as well!
1,"Love this dress!!! I bought this dress tonight and i love it! the fit is perfect and the color is perfect! the dress runs true to size, as all dolan products do. i ill wear this dress to an interview with tall heel boots. love this dress and think everyone should give it a try!"
1,Super cute I loved this dress so much i got it in 2 colors. i had to send it back twice to get the size right. i ended up with a medium. the fabric was pretty wrinkly on arrival. it is dryclean only. overall it is an easy and relaxed dress appropriate for work but still very cute.
0,"So super small I can't believe how small this thing runs. beyond small. it's almost insulting because the dress is just so gorgeous you really want it to work, but there's no way it's going to when the l is actually a s. so sad to return this beauty."
0," Was excited to try this interesting skirt, as a mega bailey 44 fan. however, this skirt didn't fit well. the waist was fine but it then was boxy and shapeless on me in an xs/size 0. my piece also had a wrinkle from folding and i'm not sure how it would easily come out but the main thing is that the lines weren't flattering to the body. the ""vegan"" quilting isn't luxurious. i thought the diagonal zipper style was cool but it doesn't lay to advantage when worn and i'm an easy fit. length is so-so,"
0,Wonky This skirt fits in a strange way. there is one pleated area but it is on the side so it is not flattering and i kept feeling as if i wanted to straighten the skirt.. the elastic looks frumpy. unflattering.
1,"Nice quality Fits pretty true to size, thick material, sits nicely."
1,"Absolutely adorable I'm in love ... with this super cute dress!!! the material feels so good on my skin and it has more 'body' than it appears on the pic ! i'm 5'2"" 115 lbs - i bought the s petite and it's perfect for me - slightly loose - i could have probably fit in an xs but i like the freedom that the s gives me! it my official spring dress !"
1,"Super cute. a wee bit small. I'm loving these, even if they are a wee bit tight. i'm 5'6"" 130 lbs and they hit well above my ankle, as in the photo. ordered a 29 (i vacillate between a 28 and 29) and am finding a little muffin top spillage even after wearing a couple of times. the good news? these babies stay pretty well exactly as they come - as opposed to stretching out a ton. the denim is durable and stretchy and i would totally recommend them."
1,"Great Bought this in navy in the spring and this fall in green. i am 5'10"" and 57 with very long legs and they are too short to be work appropriate as a dress, at least for me. i wear both with leggings, short boots and a variety of jackets and love them. they feel like butter against the skin and are incredible comfortable. recommend. for reference i'm about 157# and an athletic/straight build and bought m in the blue and l in the green. go figure."
1,"Versatile spring dress Spied this dress in my local retailer and figured i would try it on for overall fit before ordering the petite on line. for some reason retailer has eliminated in-store petite items (so disappointing). i was pleasantly surprised the xs regular fit well and was soon in my checkout pile. the dress is very soft although i suspect it will wrinkle when packed in a suitcase. the color blocking is great and makes this dress so versatile for spring, summer and fall. the xs regular fit my 5'1"" 115 lb"
1,"So in love I love this dress so much i bought it in 2 colors, it's so soft and cozy, i want to live in it!"
1,"Cute and comfy As t-shirts go, this one has a flattering fit...shapely waist yet not so tight that unwanted curves show. i bought the striped one in my usual medium and it fits perfect now, so will have to be careful when washing. if it were available, i would have tried the large, so if you're a tad senitive about tight clothes i suggest upsizing. it's a nice weight fabric and the details around the v neck are great....the v dips just like the photo - approprialty sexy and age appropriate (i'm 62, 5'3"" at 125"
1,"This tee is flattering and comfortable. I love this tee. it has a very flattering fit and the fabric is very soft. it runs small, especially in the arms. i suggest sizing up. the tee looks great on. it is slimming and super comfortable."
1,"Beautiful & classic Love this skirt, i ordered a small, i'm 5'1, about 120, still losing some baby weight, so the elastic band is really nice because it will still fit once i get down to 110. really love the cut, it falls just above my knees in the front, longer in back. i wore it to church with a cream top with victorian lace around neck, tucked in, and added a belt for a nicer finish, although the band looks good without the belt too. i got tons of compliments from everyone. definitely a score.

1,Great t shirt! I love this simple but stylish t shirt - the fabric is soft and it fits true to size and i knew i would love it even before it was delivered. i recommend it!!
1,"Easy style This is such a lovely dress -- and it looks great on! like other customers, i like the petal hem and the top part, which is stretchy, is soft and not clingy.
 
i think the only drawback is that the color isn't as rich a green as it looks in the pic. i've attached a pic for comparison and contrast purposes.

i'll be wearing this way into the fall!"
1,"Great dress! This dress is great! the fit is perfect and very flattering. the two colors and asymmetrical hem on the front make it different than you average sundress. looks great with flip flops, sandals, wedges or booties. will be a great piece for summer but the darker colors also make it the perfect transition to fall dress."
0,"Did not fit I'm a pretty solid 10 these days (and had no trouble fitting into other size 10 dresses at the store). the large was so tight around my hips. i barely got it on. they didn't have an xl to try on, but i can't imagine i would have fit in it. so, if you have wide hips, this is not the dress for you. it fit fine on top in the l, it was just so tight in the hips that it did not lay nicely."
1," For the price, this top holds up. the colors make this top more interesting, but the white is rather plain and sheer. i tried on my usual size small and it fit well - 5'8"", 135 lbs, 32d."
1,"Shinier than expected, hi-lo hem This is a lot shinier in person, and the elastic band is really tight but i still selected true to size.
there is a hi-lo hem going on that doesn't flatter my legs but it looks fantastic from the side.
due to the stiffness of the material and the tightness of the band, it can get crumply on the side if you don't get the right size. the material feels a little thin and scratchy."
0,"Not for the short-waisted This dress is sort of a mixed-media dress. the top colored portion is a slinky knit that dolan uses all the time. i like it a lot. the bottom, is a tight silky twill-like weave. the silhouette is straight, which is what attracted me to it, but when i put it on, i realized that the waist wasn't going to work for me. the split came at a point too high for me to belt and the sleeves made my wide shoulders look dowdy. i am not a person that wants to put on a dress and have to style the heck out of i"
1,"The perfect, effortless dress! I love the color combo, look and feel to this dress. 5'4, 120lbs and the xs fits as pictured."
1,Perfect fitting white top It is the cutest detailed little white top. i recommend this because you can wear it anywhere and dress it up with a scarf.
1,"Need to style this one This dress is just as it looks in the pictures. shapeless. the trick is to add some styling to it. add the pilcro dark denim jacket and the headwaters scarf, and your all set. i had on black seychelle loafers but would pair it with a black d'orsay flat. the top blue of the dress is a faded sun washed looking navy and it goes well with the black of the skirt. i usually wear a 4 in dresses and the xs in this dress fit well. i'm 5'3ish"", 118#, 34d-dd. this is going to be a nice winter to spring dre"
1,"Perfect Everything about this dress is perfect...the material, style, and fit. flattering and comfortable. i'm 5'9"" and the length was just above the knee. you can dress it up or down. comfortable. i definitely recommend."
1,Perfect! I purchased this for my 20-something daughter. it is so complimentary and cute and stylish!
1,"Gorgeous but... I ordered this dress in a 12 which is my usual size and it was tight around the waist and across the back. i am 5'7 170lbs, small chest but broader shoulders and back and curvy butt. this dress is beautiful quality and well made but was too snug. it was very long, to the point where i would only be able to wear heels. the belt is cheap looking, i would recommend replacing it with something nicer. the waist drops slightly below the natural waist and the top puckers over it in the front and back."
0,"Cute but not practical This dress runs waaaay small. i would have too size up at least 2 sizes. while it is a beautiful color, it is an extremely stiff dress. returning!"
1,"Lovely autumn/winter dress I saw the colorblock horizon dress in my local store (which sadly no longer carries petites) in the red/black color combination and loved it - the colorsblocking, the fabric, the length. after ordering a few petite sizes online the only xsp was the green/black. although not what i would normally where colorwise, i love this dress and the xsp is the only one that fits. this dress runs large and on a smaller frame, the sp looked shapeless and unattractive. perfect length and attractive v-neck that"
1,A little sparkle goes a long way I love this skirt. it fits perfectly. great to transition from work to after-work event. very comfy. got lots of complements.
0,Center pleat off center I ordered this skirt because it looked cute and versatile. when it arrived the pleat in front (shown in the center) was far to the right so the overall look was crooked. not sure if it was a quality control issue or if that's the true design but it will have to go back. too bad because i had high hopes!
1,Versatile dress I am petite but chesty and this dress is flattering. it is a loose fit but not tight across the bust line. i tried it on with nude shoes and it dresses it up. i ended up buying this dress in a regular cut (s) because i wanted it to not be so short which made it look more like a casual dress to wear with the ocean behind you. i think it is a perfect day dress to go anywhere and by changing your shoes or adding a thin sweater or short jacket you can go out to dinner or theatre. the picture is a tr
1,"L space estella bottom I wear a 25/26 jean and the size s in this bikini bottom was just too small. in photos it looks so cute, but on me it just didn't look like anything special. hopefully the larger size has more pizzazz."
1,Fabulous dress My favorite new dress. i love the feel and slight weight of the fabric. it's very flattering and easy to wear.
1, Love this shirt! got it in white and it will be perfect for spring! very flattering fit!
1,"Great, versatile cardigan I really like this piece; the fit is great, the double zipper falters and cinched waist and 3/4 sleeves flatter. i will say, it's pricey for what it is (a cardigan) - but it's a great, versatile closet staple."
0,"Had potential, better suited for someone taller I was really excited about this skirt because i love the color. however when i tried it on, it was too much of a high/low. i am not very tall but this would look a lot better on a tall person."
1,"Has potential Its just ok. the bodice is fitted and this dress runs tts. it does have a little more poof on the skirt part of the dress than it looks on the model. at this point in my life when i buy a dress i have to say right away ""i love it"" and i just didn't. my husband looked and said it is just a ""blah"" color on me. so that maybe part of it. the fabric is nice, doesn't seem inexpensive and the lining is soft and falls nicely underneath the lace. i am 5'("" and the dress does fall exactly as it is shown o"
1,"Comfy and stylish This skirt fits true to size and sits on the natural waist nicely. i've paired it with black, and the contrast is very nice. the material is thick enough for winter, but will also work for the fall months, too."
1,"Great after washing At first i didn't like the way this skirt hung -- the fabric seemed stiff and it stuck out at the sides where the straight front seam meets the dipped back. but i ran it through a wash and dry, and it softened up and hangs much better! you have to love a polished looking skirt that you can launder with all your other clothes. i am also very pleased that although it looks bulky in the pictures here, it isn't at all, and it doesn't wrinkle - perfect for traveling light. note also that the front pl"
1," Loved this top from the moment i saw it. i was bummed that this top wasn't available in petite sizes, but since it was my birthday i thought i would treat myself. i purchased the xs. after receiving it and trying it on, it was big under the arms and waist area, i kind of expected that since i am always a 00p in most retailer clothes. i had the top altered at a local tailor and now it fits me perfect."
1,"Great quality I was a bit dubious of the top because online the video of it made the top look frumpy - wide and wrinkled looking. the top seemed shorter in the video than in the pictures. so i wondered if the images were massaged a bit in photoshop. i got it today and it's fully lined and the material is pretty thick which gives it a rich look and feel. i like the top even though it highlights my hips a bit and being pear-shaped i don't normally like that, but being thin helps. the best part of the top is the"
0,"Too boxy, pretty material I really wanted to like this top. in person though, the fit was too large and boxy. i did order a smaller size based on other reviews but it was still too sacklike. i got the grey motif pattern which i thought was quite pretty and interesting. the material was nice and lightweight. perhaps it would look better on someone with a straight figure and small bust."
1,Great staple tank! Ordered two of these and they fit great and will be perfect for layering.  true to size fit.  cute detail in the back for a racer tank!
1,"Haute rock ~ rocking sexy! I completely disagree with the previous review. i purchased this dress and i absolutely love it! i went out for a couple occasions (one being special and the other not so special) and both times i received compliments all night! my husband loves it and that really says a lot. i feel the dress runs true to size, and the quality is right where it should be... runway worthy... absolutely!.... worth $3000's + ?....probably not, but i personally can't afford that anyway. i'm so happy to have found th"
1,"A classic with a twist I am 4ft 11and 114 lbs. and i tried on the regular 0 and 2. the 2 fit  better but there was too much extra material in the back so i order the 2 petite. the 2 petite fit perfectly, very classic in the front with the right amount of flow in the back. i can't wait to wear this to work or out to dinner with the girls."
1,"Better in person I am going to have to disagree with the first reviewer. this is not the most beautiful top i have ever purchased from retailer, but i like it. it is a nice change from the swing silhouette that tendd to look like maternity wear on me. the key to this is to tighten the drawstring a bit. it is a working drawstring all the way around, and i find that the top is much cuter with the drawstring cinched a bit. i actually like the flowing arms, too. the fabric is lightweight - nice for the very warm midwe"
1," I love this tunic. the fit is just lovely for me--i'm a large busted, muscular shouldered woman who wears a 4-6 on the bottom. the 8 fit perfectly across my chest (34ddd) without horrid, gaping armpits. and the gathered back gives just enough extra fabric so that the buttons do not pull at all in front--not easy to achieve in a button down for a big chested girl! i also love the cut and flow--it is fabulous and hip with skinny jeans and platform heels, but also cute with flat sandals for a day o"
0,Not a good look Pretty disappointed in this sweater. should have sized down because it's quite wide. i also didn't like the stair step. the back clung to my rear. not attractive. the colors seemed to be striking online but in reality are not. returning mine.
1,"Very cute top I really liked the top once i saw it, but it needs to be worn with a cami underneath. the fabric is a little stiff. it runs true to size and it fits like a peplum top with extra space around the waist. the top is not really crocheted by hand it was done by machine, but it is a nice top."
1,"Regular size too voluminous... When i ordered this all the petite sizes were no longer available. i tried the xs. it was actually a nice length for me (5'4"") and even the arm openings were not too large which is a plus. i expected all the extra flow and material on the back of the tunic but there was too much fabric on the front too...very unflattering. if it had been a closer fit on the front i probably would have kept it. the color is very nice but the fabric is pretty standard...nothing that makes it stand out. it is very"
0,"Cheap This dress looks nothing like the photo. the sequins are dull, no sheen at all. the faux leather panels and straps look and feel like cheap, shiny plastic. i didn't even try it on, because it was so hideous, when i pulled it out of the box. not remotely worth the price and wouldn't buy it on sale for $20 either. skip."
1,"Good white tank Basic ribbed white tank with a little character in the back. could easily be dressed up or down, material is soft and light and has a slight stretch. i will be getting a lot of use out of this piece."
1,Beautiful fabric great for spring I was very impressed with the quality of the satin. this top can easily be dressed up or down. i purchased the white and love it! the almost full zip back makes for easy on and off. i ordered a medium and think it runs a little big.
1,"Warm and cozy Perfect for the change in weather, this sweater is very thick and a tad big. i would say it is true to size, but if you're like me and usually order up in sweaters and outerwear, don't. there is ample room for layering underneath without being too cumbersome. the color is a bit different than that shown; it is more of a blush heather with light gray threads intertwined. just a note, the pin does not come with the sweater; the closeup made me think it did, but it really doesn't matter. the color"
0,"Had high hopes but... Gals, if you absolutely must have this top wait for it to go on sale (don't worry, it will). between the poor fit and the polyester, i have no good things to report about it. this is very much below retailer's usual quality and style."
1, I ordered this for my honeymoon and it's perfect! true to size and great with cute shorts!
1,"Cute hemline The hemline on this is somewhat see through and that makes this denim skirt really stylish. the waist runs small so i had to return my size for the next size up which was still a bit snug. but the skirt is so far beyond the normal, ho-hum denim skirt i just have to keep it. at 5'3"" it hits just right, slightly above the knee."
1,"Exactly as shown This vest is beautiful and exactly as shown in the model shot. it is soft, warm, and drapes beautifully...perfect length on my 5'7"" frame. the leather detail along the edge is a nice high-quality touch. i will say that it is pretty itchy especially around the neck, but wearing a shirt with a collar like it is shown seems to help that issue. the dark color is navy in the print (not black)...overall i think this is gorgeous, but the full price feels a little ludicrous...i think i may wait until sa"
1,"Feminine appeal I ordered this online which is always a gamble when it comes to fit. i was pleasantly surprised. color is true white and lace is not flimsy which i appreciate. good coverage of the girls so i don't have to layer over a tank. also arm holes don't gap and they're not too tight. beautiful with trousers, jeans or a skirt. i've already worn it twice to work. i know i'll be wearing it a lot. fit seems true to size. i usually order a medium and i ordered a medium which fits me perfectly."
1,"Love it! I just got this skirt in the mail, and i'm absolutely delighted with it. i'd ordered both my normal size and one size up, taking a tip from the reviewer who'd found it snug, but my usual retailer size fit beautifully. (i do have narrow hips, though, so maybe it's snug on more curvaceous figures?) the fabric is so soft and supple. and i've already tried the skirt with several widely varying shoe styles, so i can confirm its versatility: it looks feminine with heeled sandals (as in the pictur"
0,"Itchy scratchy Cute sweater, i really like the grey color. unfortunately, it was boxy and a little short on me. almost worth keeping, but even with a t-shirt underneath, i wanted to scratch my skin off. it's very itchy. mine is going back."
1," I have two tracy reese skirts from a few years back that i still wear. so i am favorably disposed to this designer's style and quality. this is a slim fitting skirt, though i ordered it in a 6 and my two others are 8s. so i don't agree with previous review that this skirt runs large. it is nicely fitted and flattering. it does not ride up when sitting, which is almost amazing. i wish the pockets laid a bit flatter. also, on my skirt there is no sewn-in fabric or laundering instructions. none! th"
0,"Wanted to love.. Loved it online for its modern cut and print. however, when i received the item i was disappointed. i ordered my usual size 4 and i was swimming in it. i like oversized things and understand that this dress is made that way; however, this was not flattering. i would say i would have needed to size down to a 0 and perhaps it would work but i didn't want to take another chance. the material seemed almost crepey, which i wasn't neccissarily expecting either. bummer that it didn't work out."
1,"Cute- runs a little snug on me Adorable skirt. the eyelet part on the bottom is cut-out so see through but cute and subtle. found it fit a little snug on me- could just be my build, but i ordered it in normal size and 1 size up. the size up fit best."
1,"Okay leggings The velvet isn't as soft or plush as i thought it would be but these are comfy pants. i won't wear them until next winter, which is fine."
1,Perfect summer tank This is such a cute and unique top. the fabric is substantial linen but a little rough.. i went with my regular size but the straps are a little loose. i am thinking of having them altered. planning on wearing this with a bandeau. perfect for summer
1," Beautiful blouse. i bought this in cream. runs tts. can wear with jeans, skirts etc. love front and back! very flattering arms."
1,"Perfectly long I love these pants! the pattern is polished and the flowy style is perfect for warm weather. i ordered a small and was worried they would be too short (i'm 5'10""), but they are just right when i wear them just slightly lower than my true waist. my new favorite summer pants."
1,Comfy and pretty! Saw this tee on line and thought i'd give it a shot - the fit is very complimentary and the material is heavenly! i get lots of raves about the casual yet pretty style too. great shirt!
1," Like another reviewer, i recently had a baby and ordered this to hide my belly. the m fits perfectly without looking too large, and the sleeves fit me just fine. i love the thicker fabric, and his is he perfect length for leggings."
1,"Perfect all occasion top Absolutely love! wear it with suits, jeans...anything. the orange color is super unique and the lace is so pretty and seems like it will hold up over time. so glad i purchased!!!!"
1,"Had me at first glance I saw this top online and had to buy it immediate (which is rare for me). it looked loose and forgiving but had a polished look. it didn't disappoint when i tried it on. however, the straps are a bit loose and will need to be altered. the linen fabric can be rough or itchy, but still a gorgeous top!"

1,"Maeve delivers again! Like all maeve tops of this nature, i am absolutely in love! maeve always has a cute spin on an otherwise basic top. this top looks great with jeans, shorts, skirts, etc. i purchased it in all 3 colors. the blue is more of a robins egg blue, the orange is a great tangerine color (perfect for us tennessee fans!), and the ivory is a wonderful brownish-white. the ivory is my favorite because it's a very unique color.. i have a ton of white and ivory tops, but i do not have one in a color like this"
0,"Orange color was pretty, poor quality fabric I ordered a size 16 in the orange. it ran a size smaller than normal size 16 maeve tops. the quality of the material was terrible. it wrinkled and was also so thin that you need to wear a tank underneath. that messes with the look of the lace on the top. the color of the orange was gorgeous."
1,"Best fall tee! Works great on my 5'11"" frame.  is pretty and feminine.  great with skinny jeans and booties!"
1," Very cute shirt, well made, nice detail, but a little long for my taste but i did keep it"
1, Super cute and comfy. bottom of the legs have about a 8in slit that is not shown in pictures. also the hem came unraveled after the first wear. worth the money on sale! received many compliments. not see through!
1," I've been anticipating the arrival of these pants and was literally at the doorstep with ups. i have a birthday celebration visiting wineries and thought this would be the perfect outfit.it did not disappoint. fits like a glove....very flattering and comfy! i am 5""4 and ordered a small petite. not too short, but still have the option of wearing sandals. i hesitated because of the price - but so worth it!!"
1,"Straps are too long This top has a nice print and material.  being a full figure, it helps when a material stays put instead of being too flowy.  not very keen about the straps.  they're a bit longer for me, so they don't stay on my shoulders.  i'll keep it and adjust the straps."
1,"Not exactly what i hoped for First of all, this top is brown and light beige. i was expecting more of a dark grey and cream. it also has very noticeable stitching that is a very reddish brown. cute, but a little different from what i imagined. the fabric is a casual linen. regarding the fit, i am 5'6"", 123lbs. 27 inch waist, 32d. i ordered the 4 and it fit well. as other reviews have mentioned, the straps are long so the top of the shirt hangs fairly low. i did not find this to be flattering. it made my bust look low and my"
1,"Love this top! I wore it for the first time this week and received so many compliments. i bought the white one and it's a tiny bit see through, but still love it."
1,"Cute details and good cut I'm a sucker for lace details that dress up an otherwise plain white shirt. the shoulder and sleeve lace is well done on this top, and the cut is flattering, skimming over the body. i appreciated that the product notes included the length, as i ordered a petite s (i'm 5'4"", 120 lbs) and the fit was perfect. a regular s would have been too long for me. the fabric is soft and fluid. i wish it were a little more substantial, but that's a minor quibble."
1,"Super cute! Love this top- great for summer- unique in the print. feels great on, a little loose but great for a hot texas summer."
1,"Flattering shirt Although i was worried it wouldn't live up to its sticker price, i'm glad i bought this shirt. it is extremely flattering in the way it drapes. the lace details make it seem dressy and special. the fabric feels luxurious. sleeves are almost too short for my long arms, but they are good enough."
1,"Great top! I wore this for the first time this weekend and loved it. it is long and lean but not baggy or tent like. i'm 6'0"" so i appreciate the length and fit. 
will get a lot of use out of this. good w/ skinny jeans and i can't seem to have enough black tops."
1,"Cute! Was not expecting to like this - tried on and super cute, comfy relaxed fit. looked good with leggings i had on but color will be great with jeans too. will wear both unzipped and zipped."
1,"Love the jade green I love the greenish option, beautiful color. the fabric super soft, and like the peek thru openings on the arms - they call it lace, but it's not really. i'm 5'9 and 140 lbs, medium was good. it is long, but it is what i wanted so works for me."
1, I love this top! it is long enough for my torso and arms. i am thinking of ordering in another color.
1,"Super slimming I ordered a size large.  i recently had a baby and was looking for a top to hide my baby belly until i lose it.  this shirt fits amazingly.  i don't find the sleeves to be snug at all.  if the shirt wasn't so distinctive, i'd order in several colors.  the quality is fantastic for a tee and has a nubbed appearance you can't see in the photos."
1,"Can easily size down I ordered one size down and it's still plenty roomy. as others have said, the sleeves are a tighter fit, but there is a tiny bit of stretch to the fabric. i'm smaller busted and didn't want the v-neck to get too low, so i sized down one. very cute tucked into jeans or paired with leggings."
1," Great fabric, details, construction...but, it is not grey!! definitely shades of brown!! i do like the look & style of this top."
1,"Fabulous pilazzo pants! These are amazing! wide slits on out seam show off your cute shoes! runs large! i'm 5'7"", 140, size 6, hourglass. small was quite loose at waist. xs fits my actual waist and makes length right for flatter shoe <3"" heel. or small petite sits on my hips and makes length right for flatter shoe. both fit. there is ease through entire pant leg. beyond comfortable! doesn't wrinkle. looks great with the roll-neck sweater in ivory and a silver wedge shoe!"
1,Black muted camisole Excellent quality! i love this camisole with it's muted shades of black. based on other reviews i sized down from my usual 4 to a size 2 and the fit was perfect and no problems with the straps being to long. a keeper!
1, Love this hoodie. i bought a large to fit bigger on me and it works well. love the color and embroidery.
1,"Spruced up t shirt! I bought this in the white in both the sp and the mp. i am 5'2"". i ended up keeping the mp (my usually size at 36c, broad shoulders). i found that the top of the sleeves to be a bit snug and i have normal size arms. if you look at the model shots, you can see that they are tight on top. i also found this shirt to be very long, even in the petite sizing. overall, i kept it as it was slimming, quality made, and the tight sleeve hopefully won't bother me (or shrink!)"
1,"Cute and flowy I'm happy i bought this top. it's very cute and almost a little immature/childish, but with the right bottoms it looks classy. i found it to run large so i sized down one size and it fits good, though the straps can feel a little tight if it rides up. it washes beautifully. will probably not work on large chested women."
1,Cute top I saw this in the store in a display and tried it on. i got it in the sky color which is a lavender blue color. the front and back are both cute. this top can be dressed up or worn with jeans.
1," Very cute top. does require a strapless bra as the straps are further out than most tops, and they also tend to fall down. also, while the top fit well, the top button gaps are far apart and tended to separate to show my chest. easy fix with a snap sewed in."
1," This top runs a bit small, but it's very pretty. i got the ivory and it's beautiful, very form fitting. it is a bit see thru so i will probably wear a tank under it. it's simple tshirt material, so i feel like it should be a bit less $."
1,Amazing Hands down most comfortable bra ever!
1,"Gorgeous fabric, but fit is loose I absolutely love the print on this fabric, and the linen blend is perfect for warmer weather. i do wish this top was more fitted overall--it seems like the silhouette is a bit looser than is ideal. however, i'm keeping this and wearing it!
i'm 5'2"", 95 lbs, and ordered the 00 petite."
1,"Well made detailed My size is 4 but because they did not have it i ordered 6. a little big but i can fix it. 
the price was very nice. 
i thought it said gray but what i got is more brown."
0,"Extremely long! Lovely fabric, color and embellishment but this shirt was so long i can't even imagine wearing it over leggings.  i felt like i was wearing a dress.  there are too many cute tops on the market to bother having this one tailored (i don't buy sewing or ironing).  
disappointed."
1,"Sizing off These are really cute pants. nice flowy fabric - perfect for dressing up or down from spring to fall. the only problem for me was the sizing. i tried my usual xs/0, (5'7"", 115lbs) but they were huge - as in, pulled them on without realizing there was actually a zipper opening! i then decided to try the petitie in the xs and those fit perfectly but unfortunately they were too short. the regular length were too long and would have needed hemming but that would not have bothered me as it would have"
1,"Cute easy tshirt I have been eyeballing this shirt online. during my visit yesterday an associate just happened to bring one out for me to try on as my store had just gotten it in. happy coincidence! 

the fabric is very soft and comfortable with some give/stretch. the sleeves seem sturdy like they will hold up in the wash. i thought the shoulder area was fitted but not too snug, however i have smallish shoulders. the v neck wasn't too low (no cami needed) but low enough to be a little sexy/not dowdy. it's fai"

1,"Beautiful and feminine I bought this blouse in two different colors -- the orange and ivory -- and kept the orange. the style and fit were very flattering. the drape of the fabric, along with length (hitting right below waist) and sleeves are very flattering. i am 5'4'' and 118lbs and the 0 fit me perfectly. i have muscular arms and the capped sleeves are perfect. i returned the ivory due to the sheerness of the fabric. it is quite sheer, which is a problem if i wanted to wear this for work. also, you can see the dark"
1,Relaxed fit I think these are a cute pant. they run large in the waist/seat area but not in the length. i'm 5'4 and this gathered at my ankle. i like them even though i have to keep hoisting them up. keep in mind the tie to tighten the waist does not stay
1,"Perfect everyday dress I agree with one of the reviewers that the armholes on this dress are big; however, the garment is tight around my chest area (even though i am not chesty) and lays next to my body perfectly so this is not problematic. i don't feel like they are gaping holes, there is just more area there than i would be used to. i like the fabric this is made out of. it is not quite as soft as i had hoped, but it is comfortable. i would say it is a medium weight-a little more than i was expecting. the flare is"
1,"Great peplum I can't believe how much i paid for this top~got free shipping special; so worth it. i ordered the blue and i love it! size small fits perfectly. i am into peplum tops lately, they are so flattering with highwaisted jeans. i usually wear a size 4-6 in retailer."
1,Beautiful dress Fits true to size. i am a size 4 and it fit perfectly. nice quality. fits like a glove.
1,Cute top This is a cute top but a little pricey for cotton t shirt material. the arms and shoulders/armpit feel a little tight but is loose and flowy below the bust. it is not as dressy in person as it appears in the photos. a cute top for jeans or leggings as the length falls below the hip.
1," Easy to wear! cute, comfy...will be a go to for summer."
1," A flattering soft basic! i'm 5'2"" 120 lbs and purchased the small on sale."
1,"Had higher hopes I had higher hopes for this dress and perhaps should have sized up, but it was not very forgiving in the stomach area on me. i still love the dress and the look of it on the model, but was less than thrilled with it on myself. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, and ordered a size small."
1,Beautiful summer shift Art on a dress- belt on the back makes it interesting
0," I just got this and couldn't wait to wear it to work today. it is such a pretty designed top. unfortunately, it is falling apart as i write this review. one sleeve is unraveling. there are strings hanging off all over the lacy arms. am so disappointed in the quality. i'll be sending it back when i get home."
1,"Beautiful colors, fun back I tried on the xs in the store, and i don't need a petite in this, but perhaps a xxs. it is on the shorter side, so no great on my muscular thighs (if petite) whereas the regular size hit me just above the knee. the cut is away from the body, a bit ""a-line"", but not fitted. the colors are gorgeous, but i think this is more of a casual dress, like brunch with the girlfriends, for example. love it... it is now in my wish list for alter :-)"
1,"Comfy, big armholes , ok I tried in the usual xs but the arm holes were big, and the dress just looked too big for me. i am not sure bout ordering petite as it also may be too short. so i decided to leave this one behind. material is really soft though, and the cut flattering if it fits which is why i recommended. i do have a lot of grey dresses however. for reference i am 5'1.5"" and 115 lbs..."
1,Loving it! I bought this in both yellow and green. what a gorgeous and flatttering top that fits beautifully. i love this top!
1," I bought this dress for my college graduation, and it's truly gorgeous! i love the loose, breezy fit, but it did feel just a little bit sack-like on me, definitely more-so than i expected from looking at the product picture, even after sizing down to a small (which was comfortable, and i'm usually a medium). i ended up pairing it with a small belt. 

really pretty dress, just be advised - leaves a *lot* of room around the waist!"
1,"Beautiful summer dress I tried this on yesterday in the store because i was drawn by the rich purple color and pretty print. i took my usual size 2 (5'2"", 110 lbs) and while it fit well, it did leave too much room in the bust and around the shoulders/arms. i had the store order me a 2 petite, and am confident that this will help. the shape of the dress is a bit straighter than it appears in the picture and it didn't gather in the waist at all, but i still found it flattering. i'm sure i will get great use out of this"
1,Love these pants! I love these pants! i ordered mine in green and retailer definitely offers vanity sizing. but i love them super cute and comfortable. i wish they had more colors available. these were a great buy!
1,"So cute! Super cute dress - swingy, flattering, easy to wear. the pattern is great, and i felt like it was the perfect length for me - though i'm short, so it may be too short for someone taller. the dress runs big. i'm usually a 6, but i got this is a 4. only complaint is that the pockets add unnecessary bulk."
1, Top is well made. runs large the arm holes were too big and sagged under my arms showing my bra. go a size smaller than your normal size.
1,"Beautiful drape, not too short, runs large I have a racetrack bra that works with the arm holes (a bit large - like you see on the model), so i am not concerned about them. i may or may not have my tailor tack them in. length was good, knee length (some of retailer dresses are a tad short for my 40-yr old self). shape was flattering. i've some weight on my bum and things, even though i'm small. the back of the dress hung well, not clinging to the derri茫篓re. the swing shape didn't overly accentuate my hips. i really love the dress. it's a kn"
1,Love these pants Bought these in 28 had to return for a 27p . love them!! i order the 2 other colors
1,Pretty but big. This dress is very pretty and we'll made. it runs pretty big though and i would suggest going a size down.
1,"Very cute top but runs large I ordered this top in all 3 colors, love the peplum.look..
returned the green, which is actually my fav color but it wasn't a pretty shade of green and i don't think that it was a flattering contrast with the cream,, especially going into spring/summer..
kept the yellow and the navy and love..
the navy is classic and the yellow is soft and flattering.
it's a very cute top, runs a little large, but is very pretty."
1,"Nice fit but runs small I typically wear a small or x-small in most brands from retailer, but decided to order a small and medium in this dress since it's a non-stretchy fabric. i'm glad i did because the medium was a good fit and the small would have been very snug. so i would agree with the previous reviewer and say that this dress runs at least a size small. otherwise i really like the fit the fabric."
1,"Too cute! Just as pictured, this little top is just too cute! the fit is exceptional, and quite flattering. another very feminine top, and the yellow color is perfect! i love pairing yellow with black, of course...but also with reds, blues...and it looks great with white 'pedal pushers'!!! i think they call them 'cropped' now a days! at any rate...this is a first rate top that i highly recommend!"
0,"Great fabric, but runs small Love the look of this and the fabric, but runs way small. i usually wear a 0. ordered the 0, then 2. just got the 4 and it's still too small. will be returning all 3."
0," I was really disappointed when this arrived and i discovered that it's basically see-through.  it's well constructed, it's just a really thin material."
1,"Nice summer piece This is a cute dress. the quality is very good for a dress of this type. the fabric is not too thin and the stitching is perfect. i do think it runs a little small. i typically wear an xxsp or a 0p and i purchased this in the regular xs. regular xs is typically way too big, but i took a chance on this one because i really liked it and i also like my dresses a little bit longer than shown on the models. surprisingly, it fit well in the chest and the armholes were not too big, as is often the case"
1,"Perfect summer into fall dress Love this dress. the fringe makes it so special! it's a little shorter than i anticpated - it hits me right about where it shows on the model and i am 5 2"". i love the length. can't wait to wear this."
0,"Beware I just got this dress in the mail and tried it on. i loved it the fit was perfect tts, and it is very soft and comfortable. however, it appears that the black striped area has bled onto the off white portion and there are stripes of gray across the chest and blotches on the sides of the dress. i am sending it back and ordering another and hoping for the best. i am very concerned that when it is cleaned it will bleed again. i love the dress so much i am willing to risk it, but i am doubtful. so b"
1,"Great dress! Love this dress! i agree with some of the other reviewers, the arm holes are a little low but not a deal breaker. i'm 5'8"" 120lbs. and ordered the xs and it fits perfect. would definitely recommend!"
1,Beautiful detail I purchased this in black. as in the other reviews the lace detail is a little snug in the arms but it did stretch. i did not have a problem with any fraying or quality issues. the shape is very flattering. i've been asked where i bought this several times.
0,"Beautiful color but strange texture I wanted to love this kimono...it is such a beautiful color and would work well with so many things in my wardrobe, but alas it went back due to the strange feel of the fabric...not a soft touch and because it runs small. i bought the m/l and usually wear a 12/14 but i couldn't bring the kimono together in the front (for a belting option)."
0,"Don't waste your money As other reviews have mentioned, this top has serious craftsman ship flaws. strings hanging off embellishments on sleeves and they begin unravelling as you try the top on. i wanted to love but sadly, returned asap."
1,"Breezy silk, rayon lining = breathable So often you find dresses in a cool, breathable material like rayon or silk, but the manufacturer lines it in hot, non-breathable polyester. which leaves you sweating on a hot summer day (or night). thankfully, someone at antropologie knows what they're doing and this gorgeous silk dress is lined in rayon. thank you to that person.

yes, this dress is a bit on the short side. with it's modest neckline, it looks like it could be great for work, but it does hit a bit above the knee, so if you wo"
1,"Beautiful color, great quality Just received this dress and i am in love! the colors are beautiful- perfect for both summer and fall. the fabric is very soft and the fringe detail adds a nice feminine touch. i was disappointed when i missed out on the first fringe stripe shift dress from holding horses at the beginning of this summer. it was completely sold out in my size 0. however when i saw they restocked the dress in a new color (and now lined yay!) i had to buy it. would defin recommend!!"
1,"Definitely cuter on This dress didn't do much for me on the hanger but it was on sale and thought i would try it on in the store. so glad i did, definitely cuter on than just hanging there. the back has a belt feature that adds a little structure. the colors are nice and bright. will be good for our hot austin summers."
1,"Great summer dress Very comfortable. love the built-in lining. it fits loosely, but i don't like anything binding so it works for me. length is fine, i could easily wear it to work."
1,"Beautiful color The shirt fits very nicely, a little large but very confortable. amazing color (i got it in green)"
1,Great dress! This looks beautiful and fits true-to-size. the material has enough weight so that it hangs well. this is a very form-fitting dress - i wouldn't recommend it to someone uncomfortable with a close fitting style.
1,"Pretty color and design. odd fit. I tried a regular 0 in-store and it was more billowy than i would like. i'm usually a size 2/4 and 5ft tall. i ordered a petite 00 and i'm hoping the fit will be more snug and that the length will be more proportional to me (the reg 0 hit just above my knee, but it might be cuter mid-thigh). it's a cute dress that can be dressed up or down and i hope it will work out."
1,"Cute but large I tried this on in the navy/white combination and loved it, except it is cut rather full or large through the waist especially. if you can size it down so it fits you, you will love it. it is very soft; an easy top to throw on, feel comfy, and look fantastic! i sure wish it was smaller :/"
1,"Detailed + cute I love this top! although it is a tad big, i expected this because the moth brand usually does run a tad big. however, i am still able to wear it without any nerves that it's too big.... hope that makes sense! the navy was more lovely with my skin + hair, but the yellow was so pretty too!"
0,"Wish i liked it I wanted to like this but it just didn't have much of a shape, not flattering at all. maybe if i was taller?"
0,"Big arm holes I tried this dress on in the store today, and the armholes were so wide, it showed my bra under the arm almost to the bottom, and it showed part of the side cup of my bra at the front. while the dress seems like it will be really comfy, the arm cuts are so unnatural, i had to pass. i did try going down in size, and petite, and neither of those options worked to fix the situation."
1," Love the colors on this adorable, flattering style!"
1," When this dress first came out i thought it was weird.  then i started seeing people on instagram wearing outfits that look super cute and i wanted it, but sold out.  so when this version came out i snatched it up right away.   it's different from anything else i own, very quirky and in style details and has a bit of a man repeller vibe, that is why i love it."
1,"Matter of opinion I have been a big fan of this canadian designer so when i saw the sweater on the web, i immediately ordered it. on the website, it looks very modern and edgy chic. i was heartbroken when i saw it in person. when i opened the bag and put on the sweater, i noticed a lot of little black marks on the bathroom floor. it came from the sweater. size small was swimming on me and the holes on the shoulders, which supposed to look modern...well, the thin cheap material the sweater looks like it's ripped."
1,"Feels amazing It's a casual dress with a luxurious feel. very flowy, but the back panel gives it a bit more structure. i like that it graces my body without showing any lumps. i will very much appreciate it on hot days! i'm anticipating a big of headache when ironing it, but i appreciate that it's not dry clean only. i'm on the shorter side of average height and it hits me mid-thigh."
0,"Cute print, but lacking in shape The print was what attracted me to this dress. and the material is soft and comfortable. however, the fit was all wrong for me. it had a great belt in the back, but hung very loosely in the front. it reminded me a little of some of my maternity dresses. maybe sizing down would have helped, but then i feared it wouldn't fit my hips right. this dress may look better on someone who isn't as curvy. it really looks great on the model, but not on me."
1,"Low maintenance I love the top for its minimal fuss - no ironing, yay! definitely go 1 size smaller than your regular size. i got my usual small size but was swimming in it at the waist. the pattern and material are great! i bought the navy blue and might also get the yellow. i would have liked it to be slightly longer, since i have a curvy bottom. i am 140lbs and got the small."
1,"Beautiful option with ""stand out"" detail! This is my first tracy reese piece, and i love it already. the somewhat edgy, unique, grommet and navy embroidery on the neckline and upper arms is very flattering on the body. the silky cotton texture surprised me; it's 60% cotton/40% viscose. it drapes well and feels good on. i will definitely enjoy wearing this for work or nice casual. i love that it is regular bra friendly. and that i don't need to stress about a low neckline. i am size 8/medium, 34f, and the medium is terrific. i got the an"
1,"Angel of the north 100% wool beauty! What attracted me to this beautiful piece is the lure of angel of the north quality and design. i know that this sweater/jacket will be worn and enjoyed this fall / winter and years to come; it's a classic beauty. when i put it on, it has a comfortable vibe, high quality, medium weight, dark black wool, and beautiful lines. i love the deep collar, slightly lower back hem, and inverted pleat at back waist to give a slight flare to the drape .it accents a feminine look and will be an invaluable st"
0,"Really soft fabric The fabric is super soft and comfortable and the look is cute, however the drape on the front crossover is not great and doesn't flatter well. the shorts will probably run a little on the short side for some - i'm very short (5') and the length is great for me but i'm guessing not for the average height."
1,"Perfect spring top This is a great piece, it fits really well and the fabric is nice and soft. it is a good thickness so you don't have to wear a shirt underneath."
1," Love this tee! the fit is true to size, and very flattering shaping. not too tight, not too baggy, good length. i love the stitching detail on the top. the material is thick enough that you are not forced to wear a cami under it. my only concern is that it says to hand wash, dry clean acceptable. i have had some bad luck with retailer tops shrinking. i'm not going to risk it and dry clean it. normally i would not want that expense or hassle."
1, Looks great on. i am 5'11 and the length is perfect hits above the knee but not too short. also room in the chest area.
1,"Circa 1970 peasant style skirt I just revieved this skirt and like it a lot. they did not have my size in petite so i ordered the regular length . it is very long. i am 5'4 1/2 and tried it with 4 inch heels and still had about 2 inches dragging on the floor and will need to be hemmed. in this picture, the stitching around the flowers appear white but it is actuallly a shiny, delicate gold thread in person. hopefulluy it will not fray with wear. i initially got a white top to go with it and it works, but i think a red or navy"
1,"Cute and versatile top As soon as i saw this blouse in the store, i fell in love with it. i thought it was a little too expensive for what it was, but, hey, that's antho for you. i luckily had a gift card and a 15% off bday promo, so i got it at a good discount. i love the fit of it. sometimes button-down tops like this are too tight in the arms or pulls too much around the chest, and this one doesn't. when i do wear it, i have to be conscious of the buttons because it can be a little gappy in between the buttons when"
1,"Better than the photos Ok, so first things first. i'm 5'4"", 125#, 4/27, 32g and i took a small in this. it's your typical cloth/stone fabric and feel sooo good!
i do agree that this romper is on the shorter side but i liked that about it. it is far more flattering than the modeling photos online. it doesn't look that ""oversized"". i can see where taller ladies won't go for the shortness but at 5'4"" that's just not an issue for me. the bottom is very flattering and doesn't do that ""long grandma butt"" that some rompers"
1,"Cute I actually like this better on the instagram picture than on the model... anyway, i ordered the xs petite (for 115 lbs, 5'1.5"") and it fits really nicely. not too short. the material is nice and soft, nad looks like it may not wrinkles, which would be a bonus... the little gold buttons are super cute, but you can't really wear this untied, so it is pretty much a strictly tied short. sleeves are flattering... i think i may keep it :-)"
1,"Ran small, pretty top & good quality I ordered a size xl. it ran small, especially compared to other retailer xl tops. the quality of the material was great as was the embroidery. i wish it fit because i definitely would have kept it. very pretty tee."
1,"Dry clean only! I saw this in my local retailer store and thought it was super cute. tried it on and was delighted. the top fits nice and looks crisp and nice - a great nautical look. the brass buttons add a pop to the shirt that is very nice. i usually wear between a medium and large in retailer shirts and the large fit perfectly. i am a 34d for reference and usually a size 12 on top. 

i bought the top and didn't notice until i got home that it is dry clean only! yikes. i hate that. this is a casual top to me."
1,"Beautiful shirt I tried this on in the store. the embroidery is very nice and the shirt is very flattering. however, because of all the stitching, the shirt is a bit stiff on top. there is not much give. i am also concerned that after washing it, it will look terrible, so i passed."
1," Cute shirt but no worth full price for sure. runs small in the bust. and i am not busty at all. definitely order up a size. i am returning mine, however, because of size and price."
1,"Love it! Ok, so the shirt is ""dry clean only"", however, i like it so much that i'm not going to knock out a star in the rating. the quality is really nice and it was not too short for me ------ i could reach up without worrying my stomach would be exposed. i'm 5'6"", 36c and 125 lbs, and the size 6 was perfect. wonderful for work and also great with jeans. i know it's a little pricy, but it's cute and unique --- plus right now it's 25% cheaper."
0,"Looks like shapeless lingerie This product was very disappointing. fabric was thin, it has no shape and hangs like a pajama top. so it's not flattering at all. at $78, it's really overpriced for what it is. it might look good on someone who has the perfect body shape (what wouldn't?), but they would probably still look like they went out in their pjs. i'm 5'9"" and not well-endowed (a b), so it did nothing for me..

also, the online picture of the moss version looks like it's a grey/black combo. it's not... it is really green"
1,"Nice and versatile Just received this and know i will get a lot of enjoyment from it. cute fit and since i have had something similar in the past, i know how versatile it is. nice soft material too!"
1,Beautiful fun dress This is a great fun dress! it's very unique and well built. my only complaint is that the colors are not the same in the photo. the real colors are black on top and a bright red with shiny torquoise thread running through it. it's still gorgeous!
1,"A little boxy, a little tight but great embroidery This top is really cute and the cap sleeves are perfect -- what i didn't notice from the online photos is that the back of the neckline is also scalloped which is a really sweet detail! however, i thought this t was a little tight through the chest (and i'm only a b cup!) and the fit was a little too boxy. the length was also just a bit wrong for my waistline/hips and in general, reminded me of the tops i used to buy from a popular british clothing catalog. overall, the quality is beautiful and"
1,Do i dare?? Lovely! feels like you are wearing silk and hits for comfort in all the right places. still mulling whether the short length is appropriate and if my athletic/full lower body is complimented by this cutie...needed a second opinion to push me over the top and take this home as a summer staple
1,"Great 3 season top This top will be great in 3 seasons. i can wear it alone in summer to dress up and with a blazer or sweater in fall and winter. the velvet is beautiful and luxurious without being excessive or too much. it's very soft and comfortable on the skin, although a little larger than i expected. i ordered my usual size small and probably should have gone down a size."
1,"Well made, but doesn't always like to stay put This is well made and beautiful, but it sometimes slides off so i feel like i'm adjusting it somewhat regularly."
1,"Love this dress I ordered this online and love it. the fabric feels nice and it if fitted on the top then the bottom flows. i ordered a 4 which is my normal dress size and it fit perfect. comes a little above my knees. i'm 5'6""."
1,"Surprised how much i likee this! I ordered this on a whim and didn't expect to like it as much as i do. it is very flattering on and seems like you could dress it up or wear it more casual. the back is all lace, in the photo she must be wearing a cami because it is see through in person. some people may be able to pull off a black bra but i am wearing a cami, which also helps with the low cut in the front. it has sort of a flirty a line shape to it, my top is a bit shorter on me than the model photo. the top is also well made,"
1,"Nice casual top Very pleased with the fabric and design of this. it is thick, but not heavy, and the cutouts in front fall so that you don't really have to wear anything underneath (there is one cut out pretty low in the middle that i didn't initially notice, but wasn't really a problem). i'm 5""4/b cup and i bought the small but would have been better with a medium as the small kinda pulled through the chest. i couldn't wear anything over it without it pulling the whole top up. it's also a bit shorter than i th"
1,Darling Wasn't sure what to expect but i like it. ordered size large and it's a perfect fit. the color is a blush beige. it falls at the top of my hips. i don't think you need a camo under it because the holes are small. it's a sweater type knit that's substantial but not heavy.  love that it ties at the shoulder to adjust the fit and length.
1,Soft flannel top Love this top. so soft and it fits true to size. i am a 36b and always wear a large. i am a size 12 in most tops and dresses. this top is flowy and comfortable.love the purple color. wish there was a large in blue left so i could order that too. love it!
1,"Summer plaid I love dark colors and i loved the summer touch to this top that i feel like i can wear it year round! the little anchors on the buttons are such a cute touch (very retailer). it does run slightly smaller, but not in an extreme way. i'd love to see more styling options for this top because i'm a little stumped at how to wear it outside of my white high waisted shorts, haha."
0,So bulky These fit around the waist but there is so much fabric and it poofs out and looks awful and bulky. no way.
0," I tried this shirt at my local retailer and absolutely loved it ...until i read dry clean only!!!
really retailer? i know you can do better than that..."
1,"Classic, retro culotte style Love these.they are a lovely gauzey cotton so they actually feel light. they do have volume however i don't believe they make you look bulkier though i suppose that depends on body type and how they are styled on top (i first wore with a form-fitting sleeveless chambray button down). that said, i sized down which meant the waistband was really too snug and so i sewed the button over to allow more room, which is why i gave them four stars. they have an elegant retro feel, versatile for spring and"
1,"Fall fun This dress is amazing! love the fit, quality and design. so unique and is perfect for dressing up or down. wore it to a wedding and plan on wearing it to work. also, i'm a tall girl (5' 11"") and this dress was such a good length for me. no one likes a dress that's too short. i ordered a size 8 and it fit perfectly around the waist and chest."
0,"Good concept, poor execution I loved these on the hanger when i saw them in the store. i liked the fabric, but found the full cut of the pant added a ton of bulk to my hips (and i don't have big hips). i also thought the waist was a bit snug while the rest of the pant ran tts. they went back."
1,"Gorgeous tee! This is such a gorgeous tee with beautiful embroidery. the colors are exactly as shown and while i take petite sizes at 5""1, i like the length of the regular for myself. i'm 104 pounds and tried the xxs but found it to be too fitted and went with the xs in the end. i do feel that it fits tts and that is just a personal preference."
0,"Super short shorts... Looked really cute on the hanger, so i took it with me into the dressing room. the fabric is super soft, and the top is very flattering however the bottom is way too short! you can't tell from the picture but the sides are rounded and go up higher on your leg. the model has the waist band pulled lower than i think you'd most likely be wearing it making the outfit appear longer. i wish i could pull this off...maybe i'm just too old for it."
1,"Easy to dress up or dress down I absolutely love this romper. the chambray material is super comfy and easy to wear. i ordered a size up (l ), and i'm happy i did bc it would have been a little too tight in the arm area to squeeze into and gave a little extra wiggle room in the belly area. for reference i usually wear size 8/m and i'm a 34c"
1,Cute layering option for fall Color and style was pretty but the sleeves were so long i had to return it. cuffing the sleeves wasn't an option because you would lose the cute piping detail and see the inside seam.
1,"Unique sweater like summer top! I fell in love with this piece the moment i saw it. unfort they were out of the s, so i went with a medium. fortunately for me, this piece runs true to size and so while slightly large, i will still keep it. the material is sturdy and of good quality, the buttons are large and noticeable and the ties by the shoulder are not flimsy. great piece!"
1,"Great tee Picked this up yesterday in the muted teal. great shape, great color. the pink one is way brighter in person and the green, i think, is more of a forest green. each one was a little different. super cute. good price."
0,"Odd fit I thought the photo of these pants was so cute. when i got them in the mail i opened the package and just began to laugh over how long they were. i held the waist up to my chest, just below my shoulders and the pants still hit the ground. i am not a short woman! i ordered a 14, i am 5' 6"". i also found the waistband a little small in relation to the size."
1,"Yes yes yes This top immediately caught my eye in the store.  not only that, it was the pink color and i don't usually gravitate towards pink.  i live in a warm weather area so i can get good use of these tops year round.  i say tops because i bought a second top in the green a couple days later.  you can definitely see your bra when you raise your arms but this top is just so soft and breezy."
1,"Beautiful pattern This dress is true to size and great for the winter months. it's very comfortable and not scratchy at all. i love the colors and patterns on this dress. the buttons are a nice detail, but after wearing this dress twice, one of the buttons has already fallen off. they don't seem to be sewn securely. i am tall and this dress falls as shown on the model."
1,"Cute and comfy This is a great every day dress. the buttons in the back make it very figure flattering, and i love the long sleeves. the fabric is light, so i'll definitely be wearing with leggings.

it's a little tight in the shoulders, which is pretty standard for this brand for me."
1,"Love love love I've been searching for wide leg trousers for what seems like years. and finally, i have found them--and on sale!!
i agree that these trousers are long for ladies of average height. i am fairly tall (5'8"") and the length is perfect for me. i don't anticipate that i will have them hemmed.
i really love the detail of the tie waist. one could wear these with or without the ribbon belt. i would say that the button closures are a bit less than substantial for the quality and weight of the fabric.
i s"
1,"Stunning design; beautiful winter dress This dress is even better in person than in the photos online. the colors are vibrant, the material has a nice, warm weight to it, and the buttons give the whole dress that something extra to make it special. i only wish the dress came with a couple of extra buttons, as the first time i wore it one of the buttons came loose and i had to sew it back on to make sure it didn't fall off.

the dress does run a little small, i think - i normally am an extra small, but the small fit me very well."
1,Summer ready I got the blue print and i love it. easy to match with any bottom really. i like that it can be made strapless.
1,"Beautiful! This sweater dress is very beautiful in person. the colors are very ""fall"", i actually decided against it only because i felt it was too busy for my personality. as for the fit, it runs fairly true to size, maybe slightly small. i tried on my usual medium, but i think i would have sized up for a more relaxed look. for reference, i'm 5'6"", 135 lbs, and wear a size 6. this could be quite a stunning piece on the right person!"
1,"Why so darn long? I don'tr even know why they btohered making a tall size for this, i would need a 6-7 inch heel for the petite version, which means regualr sized people should get petite.
also, bigger, as in loose, i tried 0 and 2 and both ewre biggish (thopugh i could honestly not tell the difference). sales person told me to try 00, so we shall see... i will need to hem them if i kleep them though.

bronze color is very nice, so is balck, i ordered both for comparison.

lastly, cut is very flattering,especiall"
0,"Fabric stretches throughout the day This dress is beautiful. very vibrant and rich looking...however, after wearing it to work the back of the dress was completely stretched out from sitting in my office chair. when i stood up a little bubble remained around my butt. not attractive. i wanted to love it but it's going back."
0,So disappointed! The armholes on this dress are totally bizarre. i can't believe no one else has commented on them yet. i am a size s on top and m on the bottom so i usually try on both in dresses. i tend to be a small/ size 6 in retailer. the armholes are so long that the dress doesn't lay right on top. i showed it to on of the clerks in the store and she agreed with me. we looked at all the others and they were the same. going up a size made it way worse. this dress might work for someone with really broad shoul
0,"A disappointment This dress looked gorgeous, light and lacy in the picture, but when it arrived, the ""lace"" that appeared gold and black in the photo was more a solid brown pattern against the black which was not attractive. the inner sheath was made of a heavy, sequined material. it was uncomfortable, scratchy and felt like i was searing chain mail. it also added bulk to the dress, so that i looked ten pounds heavier. i can't imagine why they would design this delicate dress with such a heavy inner slip. the si"
1,"This dress is why i love retailer Everything about the dress is worth it. it's true the buttons are loosely sewn on, but that's easily fixed. i'm a slim person but broad in the shoulders, so i had to exchange the small for a medium because it has a narrow, fitted construction. large-chested ladies or athletic types should size up."
1," This is a beautiful dress! i love the patterns, the beading and the texture. however, i have returned it (size medium - my usual size) and asked for an exchange up to a large (fingers crossed it will be available!) because the shoulders are very narrow. i am fairly tall (5'8"") with an athletic build. the body fit was a bit tighter than i expected also but not really an issue. however, the shoulders were obviously tight making it look too small and uncomfortable. yikes! i sooooo love this dress a"
1," One of the most comfortable tops i own. fits loose, such a soft fabric. looks cute. love it!"
1,"That dress This dress is perfect for any occasion, it looks great with every shoe and is flattering on."
1,"Quality Great peplum top, beautiful whine color. very thick material. i'm hourglass figure, 36d top so it was very flattering"
1,"Best dress ever! Omg i am absolutely in love with this dress, i saw it on line and knew immediately that i had to have it! i decided to go into the store to try it and it looks even better on than it did on the website. the a-line shape is very flattering and the retro pattern and colors are amazing! the only down side if there even is on is that it is a little tight across the chest but i am a 36ddd so sometimes that happens, i just took a large rather than my usual medium. other than that, this dress is my fav"
0," Like other reviewers have said, this item runs extremely long and large. i could have fit my body in one pant leg they were so wide--much wider than any standard wide leg pant i've owned. sadly had to return."
0,"Less delicate in person I coveted this dress for so long, but this was a case of the photo giving me a different visual impression than seeing it in real life. the ""gold"" patterns on top aren't shiny and delicate in person as i had imagined, and they actually make a very strong impression up close (and are painted on, it seems). the mesh they lay on is also more coarse than i had hoped. the coolest part about this dress, though, is the shiny, sequined black underlay. the photo doesn't do that component justice. i was s"
0,"Weird unflattering shape I think this blouse would work for petites. it is super short and boxy. looked nothing like the fit on the model. sad to return it, love the print."
1,"Cute, casual knit dress. I like this dress very much. the colors are great and the style cute and casual. its perfect with a pair of cognac riding boots and tights.
it really is depicted well in the model photo, although i think it may be cut somewhat shorter than it appears in the photo. i am 5'9"" and its shorter on me than on the model who, i imagine, is taller than me.
the dress is made of a substantial, tight knit material. i found it to be a bit boxy so i washed and tumble dried it, hoping to tighten it up a bit. t"
0,"Beautiful dress, odd fit I wanted to love this warm dress because the colors and the material are beautiful. unfortunately, i couldn't make the fit work. for reference, i am 5'3, 110 pounds and usually wear an xs in retailer clothing. like other reviewers, i found the xs to be a bit tight around the arms, and i don't have particularly large arms, so i ordered the sp, hoping it would be roomier and shorter (the regular length came down to mid-knee). unfortunately, the sp was enormous; it was in no way a petite. it was as l"
1,"Comfy and casual I wanted to love this dress so much! but unfortunately it fell a little short of my expectations. the overall quality of the dress is great! it's very light, flowy, and super comfortable to wear. i just wish it was a bit more flattering. i debated on returning it since it didn't really give me any shape but the material was so darn comfortable and such an easy outfit to thrown on that i couldn't part with it."
1,"Overall great dress, runs small This dress is beautiful with gorgeous coloring, nice thick, stretchy fabric and wonderful detailing including buttons. the only issue i had with it is that it's does run small, especially in the bust. i'm normally a medium to large, depending on cut so after reading the previous reviews, i ordered a large and it's pretty snug. still deciding whether i will keep or try for an xl, which is doubtful in availability at this point. i ordered it with two other pieces, both of those a medium fit fine."
1,"Yes to the dress Sweater dresses are my fall/winter uniform and the patterns on this one are particularly unique and lovely. i'm 5'2'' with a small bust, this fit nicely and moves well, it's not baggy or bulky and not tight. good for work and play. i would usually wait to see if an item at this price goes on sale, but this one is the kind of piece that i expect to be snapped up swiftly and i don't regret getting it at full price."
1,"Almost good I ordered the geranium and teal. geranium is an awkward pink, but i loved the teal. beautiful color. ordered large, hoping for some length. they're very lightweight and almost too short. if you hold this up its just a big rectangle, but it flows nicely over the body and has the appearance of being longer on the sides. unfortunately you can see all of my bra and to my stomach when my arms are even slightly raised. i decided to return both."
1,Love it This is a really great dress - especially for the holiday season - you can do work and post work events with it easily. i ordered a large but it fit me more like a medium. it is very comfortable and the quality feels great. boots give it the day look and a nice set of beige high heels gave it a great evening look.
1,"Nice flow I think 4-5"" shorts are the best length if you want to show off your legs, but still feel comfortable running errands, and these fit the bill. they are short, but they are loose, the pattern ( i got the grey) is nice, wore them with a black top that flowed over the waistband and felt they were perfect. memorial day, wore them 2 days in a row, all day, everywhere, got lots of compliments, comfortable, washed and air dried, ready to go again. i am typically a 12, ordered the large, could probably"
0,"Missing two large buttons The dress arrived with two large buttons missing from the front complete with unraveling threads. the rest of the buttons are sewn on loosely, and in general, it's poor quality. ridiculous considering the price, very disappointed."
0,"Had potential but it doesn't deliver So, i bought 2 of these. first in xsp. it was actually the regular length not the petite one. it did have the problem mentioned by others regarding the arms, armpit, thighness issue. i thought maybe the dress was mislabeled and i got a regular xs by mistake. so i returned and order another xsp hoping i would get one with the right length, but no. the one i got has same issues as the first one. why 2 petite dresses with regular length/? i think the dresses are defective. the print is gorgeous and"
1,Unique Love this tunic dress but i ordered a petite instead of regular because of length. fits a bit snug. i have gotten sp from retailer before and they have fit. just depends on the brand i guess. great holiday wear.
0,"There's something wrong with the arm hole There's something majorly wrong with the way the armholes are cut. i can't move my arms in this dress. otherwise the fit was fine. the a line cut of the dress is great if ur trying to hide a few pounds. other than that the does nothing for your figure. i found this dress to be true to size in an xsp im 107lbs and 5'1"".
don't buy it. i know it's tempting with the sale price."
1,"Snug in arms and chest I love this dress. colors are great, but a little tight in the chest and arms. i am 5' 8"" and usually wear a size 6. i bought the medium because i like a little looser fit on top. the arm holes are a little large which makes reaching up for things awkward."
1,"Lanka sweater dress tunic Beautiful sweater dress. nice texture gorgeous pattern. however not for my body type! i'm 5'5"", a size 12-14 and i carry my weight in hips butt & tummy area. this dress is only slightly a line, almost straight and even the xl didn't look flattering on me. and the arms are definitely smaller and weird too-there is bunching in the pit area. i tried on a large for comparison and it was too tight all over and there was a button missing too. this def. runs small and i think will be flattering on the"
1,"My favorite pants I love these pants. a dry cleaner lost my favorite black pair ten years ago. i have not used them since.
if you wait long enough, everything comes back in style. i bought black and rust. these pants are comfortable, the perfect length, can dress up or down and are very, very cute."
1,"Perfect in every way! I loved this dress as soon as i saw it online. but the price was high, and i was nervous about taking a chance on a knit dress. would it be too clingy, too stretchy, too scratchy, too...wrong? i took a chance on it after reading other reviews, and as soon as i tried it on, i knew i had found the perfect dress for winter. it is super comfortable, and the quality of the knit is very good. the material is soft and warn. the dress looks fabulous with bright tights and high boots. in the two weeks i"
1, This dress is beautiful and unique. an eye-catching piece with a bohemian flare. you will not be disappointed. tts.
0," If you look closely at the pattern it is a giant triangle running across the front of your body. this doesn't do great things really if you have more of an hourglass shape or small waist. it completely removed the idea that you have a small waist and draws attention to the area of the triangle that is the largest. also, i agree with another reviewer about being cautious about buttons, as several were off some of the dresses."
1,"Gorgeous dress with european flaiir The colors and design of this dress is stunning. i am usually a large in retailer clothes, this dress is true to size.this can be worn as a dress with boots or flats or even as a tunic. i purchased a scarf to also wear it with. this is one of my all time favorite retailer pieces!! don't hesitate."
1," This top looks so much better on than it does in the pictures! very flattering cut and the fabric is amazingly comfortable. runs true to size, i got my normal xs."
0,"Not what i expected I loved the look of this dress online, so i was excited to order it, but when it arrived i found it was not at all how i expected it to be. i thought the material would be more lacy, but it seemed pretty cheap. there was also some boning at the waist which is nice in theory, but it made the material poof out just under the waist, making me look like i had a belly. no matter what i did i could not get it to lay flat. returned to the store and bought the embroidered perennial dress instead, which"
1,"Lovely, but needs better sizing As most have already commented, runs small in upper body. i'm always a 2 or 4 petite (5'1"", 120# max, 36aa, athletic build). the petite s was exceptionally small in upper body and no chance of it stretching enough to be comfortable. since i read other reviews before purchasing i also ordered the petite m. pm was too big under arms. i exchanged both and purchased a regular s in store. fits great, though would have liked it a mere 1"" shorter.
the sizing should have been 2,4, 6 etc.

1, These pants are beautiful. the color is a nice deep red. pretty color for fall and the wide legs are very complimentary for athletic thigh women like myself. my only regret is listening to the other reviewer. these pants run true to size. i am normally a 0p in elevenses and should of stayed with that but went for a 00 because of the review claiming they run small. the waist is accurate sizing. the only thing running big on these pants are the width of the legs and that should be expected from th
1,"Sweet dress naughty buttons Knitted & knotted are my new bff. their sweater dresses are amazing and i'm now tracking down sold out versions of their apparel to enhance my closet and have a party. i adore (and drool...just a lil bit) this dress. the colors and styling and warmth make me happy. i sized up to a l because of my linebacker shoulders/broad bust (thanks retailer user reviewers!) i am comfy as long as i don't flail or flap. my one teeny tiny little complaint is right out of the factory cellophane bag, i had a loose"
1,"Beautiful dress, just wish it worked on me Tried this dress in two different sizes and just couldn't get a god fit for me. i found the upper arms a little snug and unforgiving if you don't have slim arms. it is a beautiful dress in person, probably more so than in the photos, and a nice thick quality feel. it didn't work on my frame, but i definitely recommend you give it a try."
0,"Disappointed in the fit This dress is so pretty and the fabric is tightly woven so that it won't stretch as much as other sweater dresses. i am disappointed in the sleeves though. the cut is way below the armpit so that when you raise your arms, it pulls tight and is uncomfortable. for the price, and the amount of time i wanted to wear it, it's not worth keeping. another thing is that the fabric is tightly woven so if you are cold natured and ok with the sleeve issue, this is the dress for you. however, if you are hot"
1,"Very pretty but very small This top is very pretty and looks so good with the blue flower skirt. unfortunately it runs very small. it fit my bust but would not go down. i imagine it would look better on a much slender frame, but since it fit my bust i wonder if the armholes are too big or it maybe a bit loose at the top. i like the style and design a lot, very dressy, but the buttons at the top are a bit hard to put on and remove. since this is turtleneck, every time you wear it the buttons have to come on and off. the bu"
1,"Perfect petite size I love this dress. i was afraid it would be too long because it said petite was 56"" but it was perfect. i am 5'0 and ordered the size xsp and the length is perfect. however, in the picture the lining is shorter than the outer layer, but on my dress the lining in longer than the dress in some areas. the dress is very modest in the front and the back has a nice plunge but not too low."
1,"Comfortable brilliantly colored tank Comfortable tank, i'm short but it's a long tank, even in a taller frame.  i like that it covers my mid section.  beautiful blue color."
1, Great tank! i really like the black and white striped one! very versatile .
1,"Great transition piece from summer to fall For me, this skirt runs a little large. my waist is smaller than my hips so i was able to order a small, which fits perfectly. i'm 5'5"" and the length hits at the right spot, too, so there is no need for hemming. i have yet to wear the skirt, but i anticipate that it will be a great piece to transition from summer to fall with an easy switch of the shirt and shoes. can't wait to get a lot of use out of this one!"
0,"Gathered on only one side of waist This dress has so much potential- loved the pattern and the neckline. however, only one side of the waist was gathered with a fake sash leaving the other side plain. the gathered side was super flattering while the other side showed any little lump or bump. needless to say, i'm returning it."
1,"Beautiful maxi Great maxi skirt that flows as you walk.  i can see myself wearing this year round.  i'm 5'7"" and it's still pretty long on me.  i would have gotten the petite if it were available.  i usually wear a 10 or 12 in pants and the medium skirt was perfect for me.  so you may want to size down unless you have bigger hips.    i'm not usually a fan of the drawstring waist but this one doesn't add bulk like most do.   overall great skirt!"
1," This is a great summer staple tank! i first ordered it in black + white, and i'm now ordering the coral + navy. i'm usually a petite xs (i have a short torso), but seeing the length on this tank, i went with the regular and glad i did. also, i had previously bought the filigree lace tank (same brand), and the length of the petite on that tank is the same as this tank's regular length, so i knew it'd fit perfectly."
0,"Meh I so wanted this skirt to work, love the design! but, it's way, way too long... i am 5, 5, 116lb, and the small is 1 inch on the floor. i step on the skirt as i walk."
1,"Super chic skirt..perfect for fall! Runs a little large. i'm 5'9'', 150 lbs and ordered the medium. probably could have gone with the small. still, it has a tie waste so it works! love the length and print. can't wait to wear it this fall with a jean jacket!"
1,"Perfect fit and color These shorts are comfortable but so stylish. even though, i love many of retailer shorts, these are one of my favorites."
1,Easy odering I found my experience odering the moon lake maxi skirt very easy. i received the skirt in a timely manner and am very happy with my purchase.
1,"Cool cords! These cords are a great, skinny fit.  they seem true to size for me and look great on.  only issue i would have is the color says navy, but they are more of a deep purple-ish color.  i had to recheck my order because they definitely aren't navy....but i'm keeping them because the fit is awesome."
1,"So cute, but so small! The top for this suit is great - i'm pretty small up top so it's rare that i find a suit that doesn't gap. however, the bottoms run so small. for reference, i'm a size 0 in dresses and 2/4 in pants. i ordered the xs and s to start, both were too small. with high hopes that i could keep this adorable suit (and well made otherwise!), i ordered a size m bottom. they were still small. sadly, i'm giving up and returning. 
only order this suit if you're super, super tiny on the bottom."
1,Great shorts These are a comfortable and fashionable pair of shorts!  they run true to size and look great!
1,"Ironing - ugh! I am somewhere between a 24 and a 25 (i have narrow hips but an average waist), so i was happy to find that these worked for me in me in a 0. i loved the blue color as an interesting neutral. they did stretch out a little with wear, but i still felt like i looked good by the end of the day. i typically really like cotton/linen blends as i can usually wear them out of the dryer if i'm going for a casual look - a few wrinkles with linen doesn't bother me. but these. oh my. when i pulled them out o"
0,Too bulky I like the quality of material of this top but it's too long and wide for my frame. the high neck feels odd for my broad shoulders. too bad as i really wanted to love this.
1,Runs very small Tried small and medium and both were quite tight on the bottom. top is perfect. will return the bottoms and try the large.
1,"Nice addition to everyday wardrobe... This skirt was too big so i returned it but did like it well enough to re-order. quality seems average; my only complaint is the lining seems too short for the skirt. why, on a maxi, is the slip lining a mini? the first thing my husband said was that it needed a slip. he didn't think it had one as he could see through the skirt to my knees. this is very lightweight fabric but could be worn all year around depending on the leg wear that is worn with it. it is a very versatile piece which is why i"
1,"Petite leg is tight First, i noticed that the ""grey"" was more like a blue-grey/navy which i don't mind because it's still a nice, unique color.  i ordered petite size 26 and although these are very well made/sturdy cords and fit at the ankle like the model pictured, the thigh/calves were surprisingly a bit too tight for me (and my calves are s c r a w n y).  this cord version doesn't seem as stretchy as some of their other styles so, i'm going back for the standard 26's!"
1,Striped tanl This tank was much needed for my wardrobe. i love the vivid colors and forgiving cut. i am 130lbs and purchased an xs .
1,"Short but adorable! I ordered these without reading the previous reviews and i would have to agree with everything everyone has already said. these are the cutest cords i've seen in a long time! they're definitely skinny, bridging on way too skinny through the calves but i'm willing to stick it out. the thing that bugs me about them is how stinking short they are?? the description doesn't really mention that they're crops but at this length any ankle bootie is going to be too short. also, they aren't navy. they're"
1,"Lovely I love this tunic, i wore it with black leggings and boots. it is well made and flowy. i wish it came in more colors."
1, Love these shorts! fit true to size and the material is so amazing.
1,Comfy and cute This cardigan is so fun to wear. you can wear it like as it is shown on this model or turn bottom up and wear upside down as tag suggestion.
1,"Perfect transitional piece I've been eyeing this piece for a while and gave in when there was a sale. admittedly, i was first drawn away when i read that it was a pull on style, which always seemed cheap to me; however, it worked in my favor since the small was a tad big but the draw string helped cinch it (the store currently didn't have xs). the skirt, as shown on the model, seems like it'll be great as a transitional piece for autumn and winter (and when i tried it in the fitting room, i paired it with a cardigan and a"
1,"Lovely transition piece I think i will really love this skirt. it is comfortable and has a lovely sheerness to it. it does have a bit of a weird, long drop waist, but it is very comfortable and still manages to be flattering. i think this will be a great piece for transitioning to the fall and winter seasons. i can wear it with short sleeves now and sweaters soon. i am happy with my purchase."
1,"Super cute, stylish, versatile shorts! Around 5 years ago, i bought 4 pairs of ""daughters of the liberation"" brand (very similar style) shorts at retailer, and have been repairing any and all frayed fabric in the first two pair, in a lighter material than the second two pair, ever since, in order to preserve my #1 favorite shorts. thank goodness pilcro - another longtime fave brand of pants available at retailer - came through this year with these very similar, but perhaps even nicer, shorts. i bought the yellow striped pai"
1,"Poly-tank The cut on this is fantastic, every color way is vibrant and appealing. length just skims over where my hips broaden, which is nice, and my shoulders look strong and tan. however. i prefer cotton, or at least a cotton blend. this fabric is appealing in that the sweat wicks, the colors will never fade, and the shape won't change. i find the man made fabric very very hot, though."
1,Cute but runs small! These bottoms run very small! i'm 5ft 3in and 100 pounds with a 25 inch waist and both the xsmall and small were too small. i think i'll need a size medium.
1,"Super cute Ok ladies, i love the whole idea behind these pants..cargo, corduroy, what!!!!?? and in a cool different navy color, had to have them. i got my usual size but in petite (i'm 5'5.5"" with shorter legs longer torso, usually don't get petite in skinniest, but for some reason did this time) and i have to say the calves of these pants are like compression stockings! the waist and boodie are perfect, but the calves, yikes! but you know how when you want something to work so bad....i ordered my usual si"
1,"Nice summer shorts These shorts were exactly as expected. they are nice thin shorts perfect for a hot summer in texas. i have just worn a few times out running errands in high 90 degree weather and they were perfect. i bought the grey and they are a nice change from jean shorts, but still match just about any top. i typically wear a size 0, but after reading the reviews purchased a size 2, so i would say they run a little small. they are slightly snug in the waist, but i ordered online and liked them enough to kee"
1,Size down I ordered a size large and it's so big i couldn't tell how it would look in a smaller size. the waist cinched but there's too much fabric in the hips to be slimming. the floral pattern is beautiful with light blue and lavender flowers that are generic enough to match with a variety of colors on top. it's too long for my frame. the slip falls above knee so it's sheer from there down. i decided not to try a smaller size but recommend going down one or even two sizes.
1,"Perfect sweater I love these. the white actually has a more pronounced look between the top and bottom with a little but of shading. since they look a bit different because of that i got both white and black. perfect wait and not to giant, and perfect for year round work. the shawl color is a tad flimsy in how it sits but overall these are fabulous."
0,"Adorable shirt, questionable quality I saw this shirt online first and immediately knew i wanted to purchase at least two colors. i went to my local store for the mother's day sale and tried it on in the black/white and the coral/navy. i purchased both colors. i actually wanted to get all three but had some other items i prioritized over the teal/white. it fits great and is super comfortable. i have been wearing the black and white all day today and sadly, it is already pilling and doesn't seem to be holding up very well (photo giv"
0,"Cute print but cut misses the mark I had been waiting for this skirt to go on sale as i fell in love with the style and print on the website. however, after receiving it in the mail i was disappointed to find that the cut was all wrong for my body type. i am 5'6"", size 4, hourglass/athletic. the xs was too big and made me look like i had no shape. would be cute on a girl with no hips/booty but unflattering on hourglass figure."
1,Great tee! This is adorable!  lots of compliments on color.  great fit!
1,"Love! Besides the beautiful print, i found the fit to be extremely flattering. i'm typically a medium, but the small was a better fit. this dress hangs beautifully and the unusual waist ""band"" gives the dress (and me) a great shape. i felt so wonderful wearing this dress!"
1,"Put-together and comfortable I feel both confident and comfortable in this dress. it runs true to size, though maybe just a little bit large. i enjoyed wearing it from the get-go!"
0,"Great idea but the fabric doesn't work I waited for this dress to go on sale and when it did i bought it right away. i am disappointed!!! the lace fabric is very stiff. i should have listened to the previous reviewer. i feel like it is poking out on my arms and neck. although i appreciate the careful placements of flowers on the dress, had the fabric been different, i think it would be a great dress."
1,Absolutely love I just bought these shorts in the gold color. the fit is just right and the material / quality matches up to the price you pay. totally worth every penny.
1,"Love these but run small I followed the other reviewers who said these fit true to size. i have to disagree. i normally wear an 8 in shorts, which is what i ordered, and the fit is too tight in the waist and butt. i'm exchanging for 10. i really like the color and fun accents. i really hope i can get these in 10!"
1,"Comfortable, soft and stretchy This is a fairly high quality tank which i purchased in blue-green. it's narrower at the top, more voluminous at the bottom and a heavier knit than i expected, so i'm a little concerned about stretching over time, but i'll be careful washing it and enjoy it till that day does (or doesn't) come."
0,"Why? Why does the lining stop at mid thigh when the skirt is long? makes product look cheap while wearing. love the color, the fabric, and the fit, but cant get past this less than quality feature - will be returning."
0,"I really wanted to like this I really wanted to like this, but like other reviews say, the knit fabric pills easily and i don't think the tank feels or looks as good as it would were it cotton. a good deal on sale, but i don't think it will hold up very long. i got the teal/white, as black/white and coral/navy were sold out."
1,"Stunning white lace dress This dress hits all of the high notes for me. it is crisp, elegant, and it looks like something a european coutour designer would create. i am so glad i have this dress in my wrardrobe. it hits me just above the knee which is super flattering. wear this to a fancy party when you want to look feminine and classy. it is a dress that will serve you for a lifetime."
1,"Pretty and easy Really love the pattern and color combination. the dress has an attached lining to around the knee. i would say this is tts or a little big. i'm 5'8"" and around 135 and size s fits well with a bit of extra room around the waist. print and fabric cover any perceived flaws and create a long, lean look. i love the feeling of effortlessness--with cute sandals this is an outfit."
0," While you can't count on the photo on your monitor to portray the exact color of an item, these photos are way off.  instead of the warm charcoal i see online, the pants are more of a dusty blue.  the material has very little stretch and i couldn't get into the size 24s.  the 25s were tight in the entire leg but huge in the waist.  for reference i usually wear a size 24 in brands like 7 for all mankind and citizens of humanity."
0,Very strange fit I'm returning this cardigan. it doesn't fit me at all. it's shapeless and loose.
1,Simple summer staple I love the cut and style of this simple striped tank! it's good fabric
1,"Cute but disappointing Beware. white is not white. white is more cream, off-white, light beige. i was really looking forward to these shorts but was immediately disappointed when i saw the color. they are cute, but not white. i bought them to wear with the nautical look tops for this summer, but unfortunately, creamy colored shorts don't do much for navy/white tops.also, the button is very difficult to open/close.otherwise they are ok."
1,"Please make more pants like these! These pants are uh-mazing!! i love that they have a seam in the front of the leg and in the back of the leg. i didn't notice it in the photo online but in person it stands out more and anything vertical on my petite frame is a+. way to go! these are my new favorite pants...i wish pilcro would make this style in more colors, and fabrics. 

i wear a 25p or a 24p and i'm glad i got the 25p because it's true these are tight in the leg but i think that's a good thing since cords look awful when the"
1, Cute everyday shorts. run tts to maybe just slightly small. not too short for this mid 30s mom.
1," Gorgeous top/tunic. runs true to size. i paired it with jeans, but i love the look of the white pants in the picture. beautiful and flows nicely."
1,Best t-shirt Love this t-shirt....i will be wearing this until it wears out. very soft; great fit; and very comfortable....
1," Love this skirt. i wore it to work after purchasing this, and i had at least 20+ people comment on how beautiful it is. many office ladies asked where i purchased it and one (who asked the cost) said it was worth the steep price. the green in this skirt really pops out, as do the gorgeous golden flowers. the pockets are a nice addition as well."
1,"Beautiful blouse I'm going through a blouse phase, and this was exactly what i wanted. i'm not svelte, and blouses rarely hang off my frame in a flowy flattering manner, but this one is perfect! it is just loose enough and just form accentuating enough that it looks amazing! i am petite with broad shoulders and a large ribcage/short torso, so flowy is a tough one for me."
0,"Arms way too small.. I was very excited about this dress having seen someone where it on the street months ago. i got my usual size 6 and could not button it up for the life of me. i get it, i'm busty and sometimes button downs are a tricky. however, the arms were impossibly tight. my boyfriend starting cracking up when he saw my arms busting out of the sleeves."
1,Beautiful suit Very flattering suit. embroidery is unique and the cut flatters.
1," I love the design on this top. it's a little thin, but it's held up great with a few washes."
1,"Wearing an art piece! Completely in love with this dress! i'm a huge fan of byron lars, and this one by far is my favorite. everything about this dress is perfect. it's very well made too. i usually wear a size 4, but kept the size 6 instead. the waist felt a bit too tight with the 4. btw: the belt is adjustable."
1,"Nice style Great style but not so great quality:(
stone fell off right away.
but they still look great"
0, This blouse is a disappointment . fabric is cheap looking and the cut is very off. just odd. sleeves awkward . the back of the white shirt on the on-line model is not the same as the white shirt i received. mine was plain in the back like the blue shirt on line even though my shirt was white. no ruffle. returned.
1," Very flattering suit. runs large. i stumbled into this in my local store. must have been a return. i tried it on even though it was a size small not my usual medium. fit like a glove!! covered my 36c chest. i have tried many suits and this is best on my curvy shape. flattering to tummy. i am 5'6"" 127lb.  not very toned at 59 years of age. this suit is amazing. highly recommend!!!!"
1," Fun pattern, great colors and super comfy and versatile! great pickup at the sale price!"
0,Horrible front closure Gorgeous color! salmon not pink though! lovely soft drape fabric but the itty bity thread and hook in the center is awful! i am a size 2/4 d cup and ordered a small and the closure is not adequate at all! it looks terrible closed and is too revealing without a cami underneath. does not fit like the model!
1,Breathtaking This dress is like a piece of art. absolutely beautiful on. i wore it to a charity event and received several compliments. it's just so gorgeously different!
1, Beautiful shirt. the color is more navy than pictured. the middle of the moon is stitched embroiderer - very original and a fun texture. my only qualms with this shirt is the trapezoid cut - it flairs out slightly but enough to notice from shoulders to the bottom hem.
1,"Love it! I ordered the skirt on friday and it arrived on monday. my expectations were exceeded. the fabric is great quality and there are subtle flecks of gold throughout. the fabric is substantial but not stiff at all - for this type of skirt, you need a thicker fabric. i'm about 5'4"", 123lbs and i ordered a 2 regular. the fit - everything from the length to how it fell on the hips, is perfect. can't wait to wear this skirt!"
0,"Could have been perfect... I am 5'8"", 140lbs, pear-shaped. i ordered the s and it fit perfectly, just skimming the floor. the material is a beautiful gauzy metallic material that is lightweight with a beautiful drape and wonderful sorbet-inspired colors. the waistband is elasticized but not elastic, and there is no unflattering poofing, which can happen with skirts like this. the flaw, however, is in the decision to only half-line this skirt with an off-white jersey material. the half-lining isn't horrible but i found it"
1,So pretty Love love this skirt! such a pretty green color and a great quality. this will be a staple in my closet for years to come. and i love a skirt with pockets.
1,"Worth every dime Bought this dress for easter and the compliments were relentless. the quality of this is superior, hence the price. the fact that it can be worn year round, i will get my money's worth out of it. my only ""complaint"" is the belt. that little sucker was way confusing to me so i just went without it. i needed directions to figure it out or a phd. ; )"
1,"Ok I thought these would be nice, and they are but then i started thinking that the bejewels will eventually be out of style and these can't be as much of a classic... also, the jewels make the jeans feel heavier. 
fit is like most boyfriend/girlfriend jeans, slightly loose (not as much on me due to muscles) and length on petite was close to what is shown here (typical for me that it is still a bit longer, as not only am i short, but i have short legs for my shortness!)

so if you want that styl"
1,"Nice and flattering Soft fabric, the blue is a nice color, rich. the drape effect is very flattering on the body. the length of the regular xs was fine on me, i often get petite but would not need it in this case. could wear this with jeans or dress it up with a nice skirt. good basic."
1,"Really red The skirt looked orange online, but is more of a nice red (i do like orange too though).
i had orginially palced this in my basket as a to order later to see, but my store had it. glad because i would have ordered petite, adn i do think that would have been too short for me (not appropirate for work or (in my opinion0, my age). the skirt (size 0 regular), fit my waste, and fell about one inch above my knee. i am 5'1.5"" (115 lbs if it helps#... so petite would have been short.

the only thing tha"
1,"Cozy, casual, can dress up, worsk on petite So i ordered this because i like amadi dreses in general, and was curious how hte long one would fit. i do love it, it is really comfortable. color is pretty neitral, material is thick enough for fall, california winters and cold spring days. can be dressed up a little with nice heeled booties. i am less than 5'2"" (115 lbs if curious# and this worked on me #petite, xs). i say go for it!"
1," I wanted to love this skirt and i agree with the other reviewers. the color of the skirt is beautiful. i've never seen anything quite like it at retailer! the quality is superb and the material is fairly substantial given the brocade design. however, the skirt made my hips look a lot bigger than they are because the shape of the skirt is more of a tulip-design. i purchased an 0 petite (because my normal size 00 petite was sold out) and while the waist part fit the hip part was disproportionately l"
0,"Xl fits small, light blue is pretty I ordered the white and the light blue in size xl. both are cut much smaller than is typical for my other retailer xl blouses. everything the first reviewer wrote is true. the photos of the white top show a detailed back when it is plain (like the blue). the back is just a solid, kind of slippery material. it's strange because it's not see-through in the back but you need to wear a tank/cami for the front. so, it makes the shirt that much tighter since you need to have the extra layer. 

i would"
1, Beautiful color and  soft material but runs a little big so size down. i loved that it was complementing to my figure without making me look larger
1,"Adorable skirt for spring I fell in love with this skirt at the store, but was concerned i wouldn't have enough to wear with it. i ended up purchasing it online and when it arrived found that it goes with so many things. black turtleneck as pictured, navy blue blouse with bird print, white t-shirt, white blouse, the options are endless. fits true to size. too short to wear to work but will be perfect for spring and summer weekends. can't wait for the weather to warm up."
1,Cute shirt I agree with the other reviewers. this shirt is cuter in person. it is a flattering cut and the design is even prettier than in the photos. the color is more navy--not the charcoal color it looks in the photos. the stitching is also more colorful in real life.
0,"Great top but... This top would be perfect if not for the large gap in the front where it wraps. the hook and loop just do not work to keep the top closed. love the pink color and the fit otherwise. i am almost always a medium but the small was perfect for me. for reference: 5'6"", 145 lbs, 34dd."
1,"Really, cute, but.... This was adorable, but looks much better on the lean, flat chested model. i am only 110 lbs and 5'4"" but i am curvy and it just didn't do me any justice so i will be returning. i think this would look better on someone more flat chested, because it really accentuates the bust."
1,"Pretty wrap top I bought this top to match a maxi skirt and it was pretty close to perfect.  i got the blue color,  which is more of a brighter blue than a navy.  i'm 6ft and wear a 10 top, but got this in a large hoping to gain some length in the torso out of the of a large and could have gone a size down.  the top was definitely long enough and i didn't have the problems with the gaping at the hook that other reviewers had. this is probably because i went a little larger in the sizing and i have a very small"
1,"Seriously wonderful dress! Just got this in a 2 petite (5'4"" 120lbs 34b) and it fits perfectly. the length is right at the bottom of the knee. it is fitted tight at the waist and the belt is even more beautiful in person. this dress has some weight and the quality seems excellent. there is a scalloped nude lining that is attached to the dress and the dress can be unzipped from the bottom as well.
there is a darker lace fabric under the armpit which i like since it hides your armpits much better than the sheer red lace fab"
1, This dress is absolutely stunning and well made. it can be worn throughout the seasons. i love this designer and this dress is a masterpiece.
1,"Soft and sexy These pants are gorgeous! they are not a denim material, more like the softest khakis you've ever felt. they're very flattering and hug all the right places. i am a 4-6 in pants and the 27 feels great. a worthy investment!"
0,"Wanted to love it Purchased this in white specifically because i loved the back detail-- (i don't know why most designers overlook the back??). huge disappointment-- the back is totally plain, not at all like the picture of the white top on here and the fabric in the back isn't even the same material as the front. it's almost as if the back is made out of leftover lining from another garment. it was a very sad return! i usually love this brand, this was just a quality control oversight i guess."
1,"Not red, not orange... Yes, as much as i'd have liked this to be a true red, it's kind of red-orange; i am relieved, however that it is not as orange as it looks on my monitor! that is my only slight-and i mean slight-disappointment in this cute-as-all-get-out skirt! i am 5""5"" 140 lbs and the six is perfect, leading me to believe that this is tts. it is a polyester mix with a same-color liner, large buttons followed by smaller, silver colored buttons at the apron. the larger buttonholes are red and white striped and t"
1,Beautiful This dress is stunning! the quality is impeccable and the craftsmanship is stunning. i ordered my typical size and it was snug but sizing up would not have worked. this may be the most beautiful high quality piece i've ever seen at retailer!
1,"Wider cut I ordered a medium, as i like my shirts a bit loose. it is a beautiful shirt, and looks great in person. however, this shirt is cut more wide and short than it is long and lean. exchanged for a small!"
0,"Adorable but poor fit I really wanted to love this, but it had so much fabric around the waist i looked like i was about to deliver twins. for ref, i'm 5'3"" 105 lbs. the top area fit fine (had a little extra room on either side under armpit area, but not so much it would've deterred me from keeping it). i adore peplum and flouncy tops--it wasn't that i didn't realize that was the intended style here. it was very cute from the front and back, but when i turned sideways it was just omg huge. like tent huge. i kept look"
0," Very very boxy design/cut. try on first or buy knowing you are 90% likely to return. beautiful skirt but if you don't have the right body type/measurements, will not flatter you at all."
1,"Terrifically chic It took a minute, but once i figured out how to wear this, i loved it. it is meant to be oversized, and for me looks best with leggings and ankle boots (too much bulk to be worn with even a slim skirt). i'm 5'9"", curvy and long limbed. the fabric has a thick, high quality feel; i find it quite soft and comfy. the unexpected design of the ribbing gives it a subtle chic; it's fashion forward without trying too hard. the ""cowl"" is really closer to a boatneck with an extra fold, which works well for"
1,"Lovely skirt I love the beautiful flowy material and design. definitely runs a bit large. i ordered an xs and it needs to be taken in as well as taken up. i would have ordered the petite if it wasn't out of stock, so the length is probably fine for most. shimmery detail is beautiful."
0,Not what i expected Ag jeans have been a main stay for me. they are the most comfortable and best looking jeans on my body. however this pair was too tight and shorter then i liked. the fabric and color is beautiful. i wear the same size for ag no matter the design. but this one ran too small. i have to return it. i will try the next size up if they still have them.
1,Vintage This skirt is a keeper. great quality. beautiful color. great fit!
1,"So classy! I really love this skirt. when i first tried it on, i felt as if it was too thick and bulky for my frame (i'm very slim), but my mom convinced me to get it. well, mother knows best! i wore it to church with boots and a blouse, and it looked great. i received endless compliments! it's also a modest, yet fashionable length."
1,Stunning emerald color - great holiday party skirt The colors in this skirt are gorgeous. a super pretty emerald/green color with graphic silver and black flowers. this skirt can be dressed up or dressed down. i'm loving the idea of wearing black tights and flat boots with it to make it casual or wearing it with tights and heels for a holiday party. the weight of the skirt isn't heavy so i think with the right colors can wear it in spring too.
1,"Pretty in persimmon Versatile and flattering. i don't order many clothes online because i'm a tough fit and need to try on first, but this was one of the rare times it was worth the risk. i love the high waisted, vintage style and the length is perfect. the bold color is fun. the little details are even better- navy blue piping, the buttons and the ribbon laced on the back. great skirt."
1,"Great swimsuit, but only if you have a small bust. I loved the swimsuit when i saw it online and it looks just a cool in person. however, i had to return it because the size large top was very very small. i wear a 34d bra. this top seemed like it would only work for an a or b cup size, even in the size large. cute suit for the right body, though!"
1,"Love this! Currently wearing right now :)
purchased during the first days of the tag sale. runs large (i.e. i typically wear m-l, and ended up going with a small!). definitely need a tank underneath, as the hook does not close the top of fully. like the blue color; the pink is more of a peach and made me look incredibly washed out.
a must at the tag sale price!"
1,"Runs large, pic doesn't accurately reflect color I ordered this sweater in a medium with high hopes. i'm 5'8"" and slender, but with a 36' bust, and the medium was too loose and long (sleeves fell past my wrists). i would exchange this for a small for a better fit, but the color is not the white or cream color i was expecting. the color of this sweat is more of an oatmeal - not flattering on a far-skinned blonde. i think the color would look fantastic on someone with dark hair (as it does on the girl in the photo). the texture is great and i re"
1,Petite sizing? This is a beautiful skirt. i wanted to make sure that i received a size that fit so i ordered two different sizes (pxs and ps). i typically wear a pxs but since the description mentions a side zip and it looked as if the skirt was to fit higher on the waist i thought i should also try a size up. as i mentioned it is lovely. light airy. i just wanted something easy to throw on and look put together with flat sandals and a tank for the hot weather that is coming and for an upcoming vacation to the
1," I love this skirt! i feel in love with it in-store and when i couldn't stop thinking about it a few weeks later i knew i had to get it. beautifully made with high quality materials and so flattering! fits very well for my figure (big butt and hips w small waist, sits just below my belly button and accentuates my waist and slims my hips. must have!"
1,"Great t-shirt! This t-shirt is great! it fits really well and is very flattering. the colors are nice, including the t-shirt color itself. the fit is perfect, including the sleeves. and it's very comfortable. my only concern is how well it will do after you wash it a few times."
1,"Wish it was for me It's such a beautiful skirt, i kept it around and tried it on with every top i own but i could not get the right look. the waist ""poofs"" out right below the waistband so any shirt worn over it makes you look frumpy. tucking a shirt in didn't look right because of the poof. it doesn't do anything to flatter a figure. the skirt itself is gorgeous. for the price, i need to make sure my clothes make me look good too! reluctantly i had to return it. i was hoping it would be my summer go-to skirt."
1,"Lovely, but... This shirt is comfy, fits well, the color (pink or dusty rose) works well with most outfits, but the front hook is ill-placed and often visible. it could be tucked under better so as not to show, but it isn't and does show. i feel that i frequently need to fluff it up to hide the hook. otherwise, i like it, but i wouldn't have bought it unless it was on discount, which it was."
1,"Lovely lightweight button-up This arrived in white at my store and it was so airy and dreamy i had to try it on. this is the epitome of the effortless tank. its a simple throw on with enough style that all it needs is your favorite pair of jeans and a cute necklace. unfortunately it didn't quite work for me. if you have any kind of tummy or chest, size up. i tried on my typical large but it was too tight and ended up looking like a maternity shirt on me. however, my coworker who is much more of a slimmer shape tried this on"
1,"Didn't quite work The shirt is quite beautiful, the lace is thick and high quality. however, i have a short-ish torso and hourglass figure and this shirt added 20 lbs. the peplum fabric below the waist hung awkwardly and poofed out. maybe this would work better for a taller person, or one who has a straighter build."
1,"Too long I love this skirt and wish i could keep it. but it is not for the vertically challenged. i am 5'0"" 130 lbs and the medium petite was about 4 in too long, even with wedges. my intent was to wear this with sandals so i have to return. boo."
0,"Strange draping I'm not sure if the top i received was damaged or if the design didn't consider gravity but this is not what i expected. i really want to like this top, but i don't see how i can wear it."
1,"Lovely material and style I love this shirt except that the hook that keeps it close doesn't work a lot, outside of that i love it. i typically wear a small or extra small and with this shirt the extra small was perfect."
1,"Undecided The skirt is very pretty, but it's not as dark as the street pictures which i like those colors better. it's also super long. it will have to be hemmed if i decide to keep it. for reference, i'm 5'7"" and it was sweeping the floor (size medium). given the price, i'm not certain i will keep it. i'll try it on a few times, then decide."
1,"Stunning This skirt is absolutely beautiful and is a gorgeous vintage red which is more pigmented than i'm used to in my closet, but that's not necessarily a good thing or a bad thing. it runs a little large in the waist. also, the skirt comes up higher on the torso than pictured. mine comes up to slightly above my waistline and ends at about mid thigh. however, i love this skirt and its timeless design assures me it will stay in my wardrobe for years to come."
0,"Ugh Not sure who this is for but its not for me. skirt was long, stiff and puffy on my hips. i could not get it to lie correctly. maybe you have to be 6' to pull this off..."
0," I can't often turn down a white blouse, so this caught my eye online and then in person. i love the concept but found the top to be rather large despite it being an xs. i would have to size down to an xxs, which i'm not certain would be long enough on my 5'7"" frame. there was extra space in the armholes and space around the waist, even factoring in its flowy style. it's not worth it to me to order an xxs online since my store doesn't carry it."
1,Daybreak maxi skirt I absolutely love this skirt! the picture does not do it justice. it is absolutely beautiful and fits perfectly. i received so many compliments when i wore it!
1,Beautiful detail Beautiful well fitting top. you can't tell from the picture but the entire top is sheer so you need a tank or camisole underneath.
0,"Satisfactory I bought this shirt with the intentions of using it as a nursing top. to that effect, i'm happy with the purchase, and will get a lot of use out of it. i bought two on blush and one blue at the same time. however, i was surprised that the shirt was so open and loose. i thought it was just a deep v-neck, but the design actually really opens up once the hook and eye is undone at the top. you are then very exposed, there is nothing but an opened front shirt. this is convenient for a nursing mother,"
1,"Another great retailer top! Nice modern print, vibrant colors, and not sheer (no need to add an extra layer which is nice for those of us who run hot!)"
1,"Very cool shirt This t is so pretty in person. the gold is metallic with embroidered detail. this is my first purchase of this brand, so my usual size medium fit just fine. i am excited to put this under one of my blazers for a casula friday. it is quite unusual and great quality."
1,Classy bathing suit I love this suit. the color is stunning and the quality of the material is excellent. a one piece never looked so good!
1,"Worth full price I went with my instincts and grabbed a size l as opposed to my usual medium.  fits great and flatters the girls while hiding my meaty back!  such a great artistic design, i will love wearing it this weekend.  i am scared to wash it, i may just have to dip it in lingerie powder and drip dry.  for fit reference: 140#, 36dd, i hold my weight in my neck, shoulders, back, upper arms, tummy (i'm not a gorilla.)"
0,"Item is not as shown. Very disappointed the back of this blouse is plain, not as displayed."
1,"Leifsdottir never disappoints! Love this brand, wish there was more available. always a perfect fit and excellent quality! great color, more rich and red than what you see in pic."
1,Great skirt! This skirt is beautiful! the green really pops and makes the skirt stand out. it runs true to size. definitely a great addition to your wardrobe.
1,Fun jeans!! Loved the idea of these as soon as i saw them!  great mid weight jean.  a little large in the waist.  the rhinestones sparkle and i received tons of complements when i wore these jeans!  great dressed up or down!
1,"Cool and fun! I honestly, have to give these jeans 5stars.  i loved them when i saw them in the store and had to have them and when i wore them, i got tons of compliments. they are super comfortable too!  i read some of the other reviews and thought that their comments were a little strange.  these jeans are obviously not classic and they will go of style but, if you run a little outside of the style box you will welcome them in your wardrobe."
1,"Pretty & comfortable I purchased this when it was on sale and it is a great, comfortable, and forgiving top. this top again runs a bit large, so i ordered a size down and it fits great. i think that they are off a bit on their description of the color. i ordered ?pink? but i would consider it more of an orangish red color. not my favorite but not terrible either. overall it is a great shirt."
1,"Vibrant & comfortable, what else could i ask for? This basketweave bikini top in fractals red by mara hoffman is my favorite right now. soft, fully lined, and reversible to pale pink as are the matching basketweave bikini bottoms. the pattern looks like a vibrant watercolor painting with some fuzzy edges. 
.
i got the size 's' according to the size guide on the mara hoffman site. i'm 5'2"" currently 33-25-37ish without a bra on (bra size 30d, 32c, even a 28dd if i can find it). the front coverage is perfect. it also fits around the back, but i"
1,Stunning dress I am 125lbs and purchased the petiite small. the dress is very flattering and can easily be dressed up or down. the fabric is a medium weight and does not cling to trouble areas.
0,"Too much bling for me I am a pilcro hyphen fan and have bought nearly every embellished jean they've made in the last few years. these, however, are just not for me. i love the faded wash, and i thought the embellishment would be fun for the fall and holidays. however, there's just so much of it! it's beautifully done, but the jeans actually feel bulky and stiff in the pocket and upper thigh area. i've had other ""beaded"" jeans, but they didn't feel quite so ""crunchy"" when i wore them. one other note: these seem to ru"
1,"This skirt is so beautiful I was returning something to the store. before i stepped out of the store when this skirt caught my eyes. it's such a nice skirt, with the gorgeous red color, beautiful buttons and material that is heavy and thick but soft. i paired it with a white shirt that is currently on sale and fell in love with both matching together. it is tts, i'm 5'5 and 120lb and i usually get 0-2 in size. size 0 was sold out in the store so i tried size 2 and it fits me very well. the length is great, it falls 2-3 in"
0,"Pretty, but heavy and thick Gorgeous design, but it was just so heavy. i felt overwhelmed by the amount of fabric, although this is my fault for thinking i could get by in regular sizing as petite was sold out. will be returning"
1," Ok so this top runs extremely large. for reference,i am a typical medium but i ended up purchasing an extra-small!!! besides the sizing issue, the style is super cute and perfect for any summer occasion whether casual or more formal. i definitely recommend! (ps. beware it does wrinkle easily lol...)"
1,Soft unique graphic tee Soft! sleeve is cuffed! different. called moonscape. cool vibe. tiny threads on front of moon.
1, Omg!! i just received this dress and it is absolutely gorgeous!! fits me like a glove. lovely rich reds and quality..... for reference i'm 5'2 and 99 lb and the 00 petite was perfect i could have even gone with the 00 regular. if it's within your means i highly recommend. :d
1,"Great, but... I love this dress! the print and the fabric make it a fun, uncomplicated outfit choice that can be dressed up or down very easily. that being said, there are two issues i wish i had known about, although i probably would have purchased anyway. 1) it has pockets -yay!!! but also, the pockets create a bulge where they hit my hips and it's not a flattering spot on me to have an extra bulge. 2) i washed before wearing because it was super wrinkled and me and the iron aren't friends anymore. so i thr"
1,"Go to summer tank This tank i am in love with. the color is great to go with jeans or any color i have in my wardrobe. it works with skinny jeans, culottes or a skirt and perfectly compliments the current shoe styles. my gladiators, summer booties, and my espadrilles are all equally cute with this outfit topper. it is made out of the most beautiful lightweight material and will be great for the 100 degree plus summers that we have here in texas. the bra thing is a bit of a problem because a strapless bra dose not"
1, Really cute and comfy and casual skirt. i am looking forward to travelling in this skirt and running around for the summer. i did size down one size. highly recommend. will get lots of wear.
1,"Fits very small I loved the design of the top! it looks great in person too. i am typically a size 12 top, and i ordered a size l. i could barely get the top on, and once on, it was super tight around my armpit area and waist. i am going to exchange it for an xl and hope that that will fit. the fabric has no give or stretch; it is tight fitting. underneath the ruffles the top looks like a halterneck tank top style."
1,"Great fit, perfect for summer I bought this cute ruffled tank in ivory to go with a silk wrap skirt i've had. it arrived today and it fits perfect. i am 5'5"", 125 lbs and small busted 34b. i bought size small after reading the reviews and glad i did because it fits perfect. the straps are not too long (a common problem for me), it's a nice length, nipped a bit a bit at the waist with slight flare below. also it does not gap under the arms which is much appreciated. a lot of thought went into this little top. i can wear it to"
1,"A tad thin and see through I tried on xs petites as someone had returned it . i didn't find that it ran small, it was ok on me. i am not sure if the regular size would work but i didn't end up purchasing this today as the color was jsut so-so on my skin tone.

likes: contrast and detail in ruffle, romantic

dislikes: the tag pulled on the fabric a bit and you could tell, so the fabric seemed fragile."
1,"Softest shorts on the planet These shorts are a must. they are so soft and go with every top imaginable. i bought these in an xs and feel they run tts. for reference i am 5'1"" and normally wear a 24,25, or 0. you will not regret this purchase."
1,"Love this romper Bought the blue romper and love it to bits! definitely a summer staple. i'm 5'4"", 105 lbs and generally consider myself proportioned, but curvy on the bottom, and the xs fit perfectly. many rompers have really short inseams, but this one is a relatively conservative 4-5"" so i feel comfortable and can dress it up or down. i've worn it a few times and received tons of compliments. it's super comfortable, forgiving, and flattering. i originally purchased it in black in pxs and ps, because at the ti"
1,"Easy to wear This dress is extremely comfortable and the material is very soft. i was worried it would be too clingy but it hangs nicely. the length is just right, although the pockets hit below my hips. i was a little unsure of the bold pattern but i liked it better in person. i bought it to wear on an upcoming beach vacation but now i plan to pair it with flats and sweaters for the fall."
0,"So very odd The fit on this is so strange. the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift. the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price. the cups are padded, which is nice i suppose, but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup i'm guessing. i'm a 32dd, size 8 in pants, and size 4/6 in dresses and i ordered a medium. i also have a long torso, which probably didn't help."
1," Love, love, love. like another chambray item i have, they feel stuff and rough after washing, but once you put them on, they soften up and look great."
0,"Too short and too wide I&#39;m taller (5&#39;8), so it&#39;s not uncommon for things to be too short on me, but this was really short for the style.  it was very wide and loose all over in my usual size - both up top and in the wavy part below.  the style really just did not work with the length.  it looked very odd."
0,"Short and wide I was very disappointed by the fit of this top. it is quite short (especially in the back) and very wide. i did not find it flattering. on a positive note, the fabric is nice and thick - very warm layering piece for fall. for sizing reference, i'm 5'5'', 122 lbs, and took my usual size xs."
1,"Perfect easy breezy dress I love unstructured pull on dresses in the summer and this maeve is better than photo. i wear a medium and fit is spot on. i also purchased the earlier version of this dress, same style and maker, different pattern and have gotten a lot of wear out of it this past summer. i expected this dress to be identical, but it's even better, it's fully lined and is a slightly different and more substantial fabric.
and did i mention pockets! i plan to wear it into the fall with a short cardi to dress it u"
1,"Beautiful top - runs large I ordered a m and l based on the reviews - and both were too big. this is a drapey top with large arm(pit) openings.
i have since ordered a small and hope this fits well.
in general, this top is beautiful.
i usually wear a 4/6 or s/m top/blouse and am 5'8"" with a slim build. the m should have fit better than it did."
0,"Strangly clingy I'm not sure if it was my undergarments or not, but the top clung to me in a strange way. the colors are rich but in addition to the odd fabric, the sleeves did not flatter my upper arms."
1, I purchased this dress in 4 colors...beautiful and so comfortable. highly recommend
1,"Easy to wear and go Love this dress! runs big though, size down"
1,Fun romper Love this! i sized up to xl from large.. great pattern. very soft. i am thick legged and big booty. this romper is the perfect length. the only issue is when i need to use the bathroom. hard to unzip from the back in a hurry. i had my husband unzip for me in order to pull down.
1,"Versatile! I didn't expect to love this dress.. i assumed it would be something i'd return. this dress is so cute on! i love how well it fit me and that i could dress it up for work with booties, or pumps and a cardigan or dress it down for happy hour or a baby shower. i ordered a small ( i am 5'4 and 130 lbs) and it fit me like a glove....good job maeve you did it again!"
1,Loved the colors Love the dress. runs a little big. i ordered a size down than i normally wear and it fit. versatile too--i even wore it to the office with a black blazer over it and got lots of compliments!
1,"Great jeans...with tailoring Having recently purchased a pair of citizen jeans from retailer in my normal size, i went ahead and ordered these because i needed a skinnier fit (my stevies finally ripped). they fit sort of big in the seat, but improved upon washing and are a bit more snug. i took them to the tailors and had the length taken up (i always have to do this, but these were particularly long). they are not as skinny as on the model, but will still working for going to work. not really what i was looking for (an every"
0,"Skylar buttondown The fit is slightly loose, but figure flattering, the fabric is semi sheer and the light, coral color is very pretty. however, after one, short wear i discovered fabric torn from both sides of the back seam. unfortunately, i need to return this blouse asap."
0,"It's okay I've noticed this sports bra several times in my store-along with a whole line of products that share this fabric and didn't feel necessarily compelled to try it on but i finally did this last time at retailer. i pretty much predicted what i was going to think of it. i like the back with the extra strappy open section, but that is where it ends. the fabric is not particularly flattering, and i didn't think the bra accentuated my chest. i do have a small bust size, but i have a lot of sports"
1,"Unique and different skirt -- work of art! I love an item of clothing that i am able to justify its purchase by knowing it is unlike any other piece in my closet. this skirt definitely fits that desire.the material looks almost like the colors were ""felted"" onto the dark background creating a wearable art piece! very vibrant colors. the material itself is somewhat stiff and maintains its structure when on. i needed to wear a size 6 (i'm sometimes a 4; sometimes a 6 with a waist measurement of 28"") and the skirt sits at the smallest part"
1,Well quality This dress is made well. love the design and the colors. i ordered a size 2 and it was smaller than i expected. but overall quality of this dress is so worth the price.
1,"Perfect for california winters This sweater/coat is great. it super comfortable. it's perfect for my california winters! it could be layered for colder areas. this piece definitely runs large- like really large. i went with an xs instead of my usual small or medium. it is meant to be boxy, and still is but sizing down allowed for it to be more flattering. i'd definitely say go in store and try it on, you'll love it!"
0,Too much piling Loved the design but jacket looked like 20 years old because of a lot of piling even brand new jacket at store. i wish they use better quality fabric so i would have purchased it.
1,"Confidence-booster! I'm pear-shaped so my inclination is to always grab an a-line/fit-n-flare style dress or skirt. but for some reason this stood out to me and i'm glad i tried it on. i love this dress! i'm 5'9 with a longer torso and this still went down to my knees so it definitely works for taller girls. the cut is so flattering and, along with the thicker material, it gives me more of an hourglass shape that enhances my curves instead of making me want to camouflage them. i got my dress in a size 6 and it's tt"
1,"Runs small through bodice I recommend this dress for women wth a small bust. this is an absolutely gorgeous dress, but it runs very small through the bodice and is almost empire waisted. if you remember the coral dress from spring by the same designer, it fits the same but this one has a tiered skirt. so sad- i love this dress-the colors and design are beautiful."
1,"Perfect with jeans I ordered the cream. the fabric is unique. similar to a waffle but with a dressy quality. you definitely need a cami or tank underneath. its form fitting without being too snug. i like to wear it with distressed jeans, front tucked in and kind of ruched to hide my middle, (my trouble spot) with chunky accessories, belt, necklace and a block heel. it's a little pricey but decided worth it."
0,"It's a no Got this in the sky color. returned it because the top is way too sheer for me, if you know what i mean. i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids. no can do. also, for the price, material just felt flimsy & cheap. it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i'm 5'2"", 114#, 34b"
1,"Great! but delicate These are great, the colors are a little different in real life. they are really great but i think they are a bit delicate and i hope they hold up."
1,"Nice and soft fabric I tried this on, the fit was true to size, as far as no cup size goes (32dd, got xs, was ok). the pattern i like, and was totally fine on my pale skin, but think of it, i would not likely wear this without a tank or shirt... support seemed ok too, i do like the criss-cross detail in the abck. thinking about keeping it, but i jsut don't ""need"" it right this second... dilemma.

caveat: not been tested in a workout, obviously, since i am not sure i will keep it (may chance it on sale)."
1,"Really pretty - runs small Don't size down, as one reviewer recommended. you'll wind up trying to exchange. the colors are beautiful and the front panel has a lot of texture. it's a great find."
1,"Beautiful, poor quality I love this blouse, i've received so many compliments on it. unfortunately i just got it back from the dry cleaners and the color completely changed to a pale yellow! it also ate away some of the fabric, so now it's completely transparent... and i go to an organic cleaners! 

retailer: if you can fix the fabric quality this blouse would be a classic."
0,Looks cheap I didn't realize that the grey sleeves are attached (i assumed that was just an undershirt on the model). needless to say it looks cheap and poorly made. will be returning
0,"Not for me I was searching for the perfect large comfy sweater for the cold winter weather ahead and i thought this would be it. it looks so cute in the pictures but when i received in by mail it wasn't what i was searching for. this sweater, like on the model, is quite large. although i wanted a large sweater, the fit of this one didn't fit well on me. it has more of a boxy feel to it. i usually wear a medium, but went with a small because i expected this to fit a little large and it still engulfed me. i"
1,Unique beautiful pants First thing i would say these pants run large i'm a size 6 the size 4 fit perfect i love the style and look of the cascade fabric on leg of these pants but these pants are a little heavy still a beautiful pant
1,"Lovely skirt!!!!! This skirt is absolutely lovely!!
i'm usually a perfect size 8 in all retailer clothes.
i am curvy on the bottom and the skirt pulls slightly, so i will be sizing up.
can't wait to get my new size!!!"
0,"Tight sleeves I ordered this item when it was first advertised, fell in love with the unique pattern in the top and could hardly wait for it to get here. however when i received the top i was very disappointed, the fabric is cheap, the sleeves are tight and the overall product is of poor quality and poorly constructed. needless to say i returned it."
1," Tried the navy in store. boy does it run big! i'm normally a size 6 / small (ish). 5'6"", 34a-28-36. the xs was still quite boxy on me while the sleeves were well fitted. i understand this is the style and i like the design with the different sleeves.
it was a no buy as the main fabric was already pilling in store and looked a bit cheap - sorry!"
1,"Lovely flowing top with detail Contrary to the first review, i find this top to be gorgeous. the fabric has a silkiness to it (with a slightly heavier weight). the lace thru neckline is beautifully done (the eyelets are high-quality). the fit has flow, like on the model, but still a bit of shape (not the formless fit that some blouses like this have). i love the open sleeves. i am 5' 8"" 120lbs 34b and am happy with the xs."
1,"Beautiful, runs big The dress is lovely. the beadwork creates a nice accent. it runs big. i got a size 0, which should work out just fine for me, but oddly it is big and i wish i got a 00. now there aren't any in that size and i will either have to return the dress or tailor it. i would recommend this dress, just consider ordering a size down from your usual."
1,Truly a fine gown for the feminine! A finely laced sheer bustier along with a gown split along the sides makes for a lovely sleeping garment. the material is cooling and the lace is not itchy.
1," I ordered this in the peach color and it is a beautiful pale color. the underside of the cuff has a pretty pattern on it, so if you roll it up once it adds a little something extra! it is extremely see through though so you might want to wear a tank under!"
0," I absolutely loved the patterns and colors of this skirt, if only the cut wasn't so odd. the sides of the skirt ""wing out"" for a very distracting and unflattering look. the stiff, felt-like quality of the material only makes matters worse. in that respect, the model photos are not at all accurate. it also runs large. i had to go down one full size."
0,"A funny thing happens as women's figures fill out I am a true size xl. in my 20s i wore a small and then medium, so i know whereof i am speaking here. i tried this dress on in my local retailer store. this designer, as a handful of retailer designers seem to do, simply enlarges the fabric measurement outward as they add another size. the problem is... a funny thing happens to women's breasts as they gain weight. is this so difficult to understand? as a size small i was an a cup, as a medium i was a b cup. now, years later, as a size 16 i am a d cup"
0," I bought this online in the grey and blue and had high hopes. it runs big so size down at least 1-2 sizes. i didn't realize that the sweater looking part on the forearms was part of the coat. that part of the coat is really nice and comfy. unfortunately, the rest of the coat (the wool part) is very itchy. it would've been awesome if it was lined on the inside, but it's not...so i'm taking them back."
1,"Beautiful special occasion dress! This dress is beautiful! 
i am on the short side so i ordered in regular and petite and due to the length the petite is better. 
the material is soft and comfortable to wear."
1," There'd a reason this dress is all over instagram and like. it's stunning and beautiful, perfect for a wedding or event. the beading is beautiful and the tiers on the dress are more flattering than you'd expect , especially since it does have a bit of pouff to it. love it, 5 stats! i sized up so that it would be longer"
1," This dress is way prettier in person than online. fits like a glove. a little tight up top as are most side zips. i did not have to size up, however."
1,"Great piece to own! I love wide neck & off-shoulder tops. i think they are very flattering. at first i thought the fabric was too thin but then realized since i want to wear this with a fuller party skirt, its nice that ir is not too bulky.
i actually think it will be really cute with white jeans in the summer and great way to dress up a casual outfit."
1, Loved this top when i received it. unfortunately it runs very big. i ordered a small because it had come up but in reality i need an x small and maybe even that would be too big. im 130 pounds and 34dd. its a nice shirt just a little expensive.
1," Lovelier in person! fit tts; i tried this on, walked away without it and returned to my store to purchase because i couldn't stop thinking about this dress. most definitely can be worn now, but will layer well through the winter - dress it up with heels and accessories or make it casual with a denim jacket and booties :) perfect floor length at 5'3.5"" in the regular 0; tiny bit of room in the bust for a 32b"
1,"Great coat! Great coat! lightweight, oversized, yet warm. just enough structure to flatter most body types. i wear an xl/14, but got medium as it's very oversized. light enough to wear with layers. got a million compliments!"
1,"Cozy and stylish This arrived just in time for the winter snow storm.

i was glad i had read previous reviews advising that it ran large, and that the gray sleeves are surprisingly attached to the sweater, and do not represent a separate top beneath the sweater.

i got a size small, and it fits perfectly. it's big and boxy but doesn't make feel like i look fat. with slim-fitting trousers - it's super stylish."
1,Gorgeous skirt Absolutely gorgeous shirt. the quality is outstanding! only problem is that it is too small. i am usually a perfect size 6 and this will not zip. returning for a size 8. you won't regret buying it!
1,"Classy shell. 1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 145 lbs, and 38 (36d) -32-40, and a solid size 10. the size 10 fit me perfectly, but if it shrank it would be too tight across the bust. the size 12 also fit me well but was an inch looser all around. the darts on the 12 hit me in exactly the right place, so i decided to go with the 12, even though it looks a little big. it makes me look smaller.

1,Stunning but not tts Absolutely stinning dress! statement piece for sure however i will agree with other reviews that the bust is small and has no give or wiggle room with the side zipper...one if those dreaded side zippers that you always fear breaking as you dress. sizing up would help but the waist then appears too big or bulky.. i am on the fence about whether or not it's a keeper ...definitely perfect for the smaller chested. i usually wear xs size 2/4 the 6 zipped the 4 nearly did but would've smashed. neverth
1,"Love this dress! I'm 5 ft 3 inches, 130 lbs. this dress fits perfect! i bought a 4r. the petite 4 probably would have fit and been a inch or two shorter but i don't the regular looked bad. it hits an inch or two below my knee. medium thickness of fabric is forgiving even though the dress hugs in all the right places. beautiful dress!!"
1,"Love the floral pattern I love this sports bra. i do various exercises and it works great for all of them from yoga to running. the floral pattern is what really drew me to get this, but the quality of this bra is the best i've ever gotten. i wear a 34b bra and the medium fits perfect!!"
1," This is a really nice dress for the money. i definitely had to size down. i've always taken a 4 in hd in paris tops, so i initially ordered a 4. but it was a little too big in the chest area. (i wear a 32dd so normally this isn't my issue.) i replaced it with a 2 and it fits great. i also have a long torso, which can be an issue for me with dresses. but this one works on me! this is definitely a good dress for taller girls. the material is high quality too. i'm going to wear it to my friend's we"
0,"Missed the mark! Very disappointed: runs small in chest and too long. the fabric is cheap but the print is pretty with the bead and flower detail. i don't think  this dress is worth the price, it is not even silk and the underlay feels like cheap gauze. i have been in the fashion industry for over 30 years and this is a miss mark in my opinion. put it back on the rack, and save your $ for something better at sweet retailer!"
0,"Bhanuni is sloppy with its construction I had fallen in love with the coral dress that was somewhat like this one and came out a few months ago. but the problem i'm having with this one is the same problem i had with the coral one. they are all flawed in their construction! i had eventually tried 3 size 16s in the coral because each one was flawed. on one, one side hung longer than the other, and on all 3, the top design did not line up with the bottom design. this blue one is the same way! the top design does not line up with the bot"
1,"Really cute and comfortable top I knew i had a winner when my husband said ""cute top"" the first time i put this on. the style, quality and sizing are all excellent. i love the lace detailing in addition to the open shoulder style. i am always looking for long sleeve tops that go great with jeans and are right on trend. this a great addition to my all wardrobe."
1,"Love I love this gown so much, i would wear it everyday if i could. it is cozy, beautiful, and feels special like an heirloom. the top is perfect coverage and the skirt is so soft. color is much prettier than the photo picks up!!! i love this gown. my favorite, hands down."
0,"Adorable and comfortable, poor fabric quality I tried this blouse on and loved the style, comfort and color of the peach so much that i was preparing to buy it. when i pulled the sleeve the fabric came away from the cuff. i tested another spot pulling only gently and the same thing happened. too bad since the color would have been a great addition for me. 

but--i also tried the blue and it gets 4 stars, as the fabric is much better. it too is adorable, soft and did not tear on gentle testing. the two blouse colors are made from different"
1,Gorgeous! Oh i simply can't say enough about this dress... it's just so pretty! i've sometimes had trouble with beaded pieces from retailer but not this dress. it's a very flattering piece and the material is comfortable and soft. really flattering. you can dress it up or down as well - i'm glad i'll be able to wear this into fall with a leather jacket.
1,"Gorgeous sweater... but not so flattering. I have to say, this sweater is gorgeous!!! i bought it in the green motif and absolutely loved the variety of colors used. i just didn't like the fit. it was so... blah. i felt like an old lady wearing it... it really had no flare to it... it was pretty boxy and boring :( so, very unfortunately, this one went back. way too much $$$ to not be in love w/it!"
1,"Gorgeous dress! Just had to review this dress because it is so beautiful. the fabric is light and soft, and is really perfect for this flowy tiered design. the colors are really pretty, not too bright, and it fit perfectly. i would say that it is much more dressy than it appeared in photos. the bodice has some beading, and it was much longer on me than on the model, though still a perfect maxi length. it would be perfect to wear to a wedding or formal affair."
1," I love this sweater. i didn't buy it the first time when i tried it at the store because the buttoned look created a bulk on one side and i thought that this was very weird. it might have been what i was wearing underneath that day or that particular sweater. but then at 40% off i decided to give it another try and i'm happy that i did. i bought the navy and i love the feel of the material. sizing down makes all the difference, too. i wasn't fan of the attached sleeves at first as they are made"
1,"Heartbroken I just received this beautiful dress in the mail after ordering my usual size petite 12. words can't describe how beautiful the fabric and embroidery appeared as i pulled the dress from the box. i quickly tried it on. the length was perfect. but when i attempted to zip the side zipper, i realized that i would never be able to zip it up over my size 38c chest. the bodice is simply too small. sadly, i have to return the dress. this is my biggest disappointment from retailer so far. if you have a ver"
0, This skirt has no closure along the slit. i can't begin to understand how it could be worn as shown in the photo-you would be completely exposed. it completely baffled me
1,Pretty dress - not for me The dress is very pretty! i ordered for a wedding and thought it was a little casual for that. in the end i returned because it wasn't very flattering for my figure.
1,Perfect winter coat Love this coat! super soft and cozy!! did not realize the sleeves are built in to the jacket. wasn't too excited at first but once i tried it on i fell in love. great quality!
1,"Nice but a little snug in the stomach Love the design of this top. wish i could have gotten it in white but was sold out. it fits nicely overall, but is a little snug in the stomach area. still kept it though, because the shirt is just so pretty!"
1,"Trusted my instincts My wardrobe craves lush detail-rich dresses like this beautiful maxi.  knowing that the dress is expensive and made of all synthetic fabric, i took the plunge and purchased the largest of my size range.  i've noticed that most indian labels commissioned by retailer fit tighter in my chest/shoulders, so i'm glad i trusted my instincts and bought the 12p as it fits perfectly on my 36dd chest and wide shoulders.  this is not a casual dress--there are sequins, beads and rosettes decorating the bodice."
1," The denim is soft and very comfortable, the color also is very dark and goes well with most anything. the style is 'oversized' for baggy look and for that reason the sides of the over-alls gape open requiring a long top. i usually wear a size 4 in citizen jeans, and ordered small in the overalls and had to return for an xs. i do recommend for comfort and fun. they look great with booties or flats and hit just at the ankle."
0,Should have read reviews Has i read the reviews would have realized the t-shirt looking sleeves in the pic are attached to the sweater. based on the pic and site description i didnt realize they were attached. i thought it was part of the styling of the undershirt. i think this very much limits the versatility of the sweater. i ordered the white which is a beautiful color and very soft. i am returning it cause i do not like the t-shirt sleeve. would rather have the flexibility to layer whatever shirt i wanted
1, Beautiful sweater coat! love that is easy to pop on & head out. i did have to go to a seamstress and have the button moved as it was to large and boxy around my waist area.
0,"Lovely concept, lack of attention to detail Lovely colors and print. my problem with this dress was that the bust was on the smaller side (it will fit those with a smaller chest nicely!), and worse, the beading on the bodice was attached with black thread, which showed through the sheer netting layer on top. 

for the price, this particular detail should have been addressed."
1," The design of this shirt is stunning. i can't even tell you how many people complimented me on the shirt. the only thing is it does run a bit long. with it being long, it can go nicely with leggings and boots.

material is a bit thin and should be hand-washed or dry cleaned. i do wish there were more sizes in petite."
1,Very feminine top Great item and very feminine. can be dressed up or down and fits true to size.
1,"Love! This dress is so flattering! i absolutely love it! it hides a multitude of flaws. the sleeves are just the perfect length for me, as is the length of the hem. the waist also sits right where i want it in the regular sizes. the material is comfortable and has a little give to be a little clingy on top but flares perfectly on the bottom not too far out that it makes your bottom half look huge. just perfect!"
1," It's hard to tell how you will like this top unless you try it on first. 1. yes, it runs big and wide but not long, which i like. 2. yes it it is fairly sheer, but the design allows for a fitted tank. 3. i found it adorable once those first two issues were corrected. it's a cute late summer top, easy breathing for humidity. 
i like this top as well because it allows for a normal bra strap, so you feel covered but the sexy shoulders peek out. it also is a bit longer in the back than the front wh"
1,"Beautiful summer too! This is a really pretty top. the yellow underneath is a very pretty shade and the tank itself is very soft and comfortable and just loose enough to hide any bit of tummy. the armholes are large, however, so they are low and make the front look almost like a halter with the way they come in. i would order down a size as a result. you'll be able to wear most bras with it but be aware that anything that spills out under your arms will be visible."
1,"Very well made but waistline sits high After seeing how this looked on model in the picture i had a feeling it might be not only a bit short but also high waisted. so i took a chance and ordered a regular size 2. i am 5'1 115lbs, so i typically order a petite 2. received this today and am very happy i made that choice. the waistline hits where it should and the skirt hit right at my knees. the fabric is perfect for winter. i was actually surprised at the weight of the dress when i pulled it from the box - it was very heavy. the lace"
1,"Breath of fresh air This looks great with the pilcro lace bottom white jeans. i bought the yellow and blue and it is flattering on. longer in the back. i love the style of the sleeves. very flattering style and fun, flirty and feminine. slightly see through. depending on your modesty level a nude bra may be just fine or else a nude cami. a really fresh look for summer. i do not think it looks cheap. i do think it is overpriced but i have a hard time finding tops that hit me at the right length in front and are not"

1,Beautiful Beautiful overlay runs large had to return for a smaller size
1,"Soft and bright What i like about this is the yellow color peeking through the white, it makes the tank look sunny/happy.
soft tank, fabric is really comfortable, fit is loose and casual, i was undecided but thought i have so many nice pieces, i don't need this one,. xsp was a good fit. i am 115 lbs, 30 dd."
1,"Order down a size! This top is very cute! however, it runs quite large. i ordered my usual size - xs but it looked rather heavy on me. the construction of the top was boxy and didn't produce the same feminine look as it does on the modeled picture. it's a very cute design but i would order a size down for a better fit."
1,"Good summer datetop This is the sort of top i love to find at retailer. it's versatile because the fabric is comfortable enough to wear everyday and the lace gives it a dressy, feminine feel. i love the navy because the white behind it shows up the lace beautifully. the yellow behind the white is also very pretty. it's fuller than it looks in the product shots. even in an xxs, it's long on me at 5'4"" but it's fine. not sure i can wear with shorts because of the length but good with a mini. the neck is also a little h"
1,Love it! This dress is everything i wanted it to be. i bought it to wear to a winter wedding and the material is perfect for that! i initially ordered it in a 0 regular and ended up having to exchange it for a 0 petite and it fits absolutely perfectly! the detailing on the shoulder is beautiful.
1,"Cute dress for younger women First, i must say that this dress fits beautifully in my usual xs (5' 4"", 119 lbs) and the geometric pattern is adorable. i often have a fit problem with dresses (i think due to a long waist) where the fabric bunches up by my lower back. not so with this dress. it shows off my curves without being super tight and the fabric has a little stretch so the dress isn't binding. for my age, however (mid-40s), this dress is just a little too short for the office so i'm sending it back. also, i felt that"
0,"Too boxy for me It didn't work with my frame at all, but is very nice!"
1,Love the fabric! I am obsessed with the quality of the fabric on this top. i am giving it as a gift and can't wait!!!!
1,Great tank if.... The detail and design is gorgeous on the tank. my issue however is that the yellow is pretty bright. the website makes it look like a butter yellow but it is actually a lemon yellow. i do not care for that shade and would definitely limit what i paired it with. bummer!
0,Not the same jean As another reviewer wrote.. this is not the same jean featured on the website. same cut and style but it's a light denim wash with wiskering and worn look at the knees. i called customer service to see if this was a mistake and they said there was not really a way to check it unless i exchanged them. i didnt want the same wrong jeans again so i opted out ... too bad they are cure.
1,Love this blouse This blouse is wonderful. i just got and wore the wine colored blouse today. i received so many compliments. i love it and with the sale price it is so worth it.
1,"Really beautiful material The material is very soft and the lace has a beautiful design. it looks very elegant and romantic. you will need a racer back bra to wear with it though, because of the design of the straps. it is very flowing and i think the cut is flattering. the material in the back is slightly transparent so you might want to wear a tank underneath. overall, very pretty and i would highly recommend. (i purchased the white and yellow version.)"
1, Love! accurate sizing feminine details my new favorite top
1,"Wonderful summer dress Such an easy to wear and nicely cut summer dress. it does not wrinkle, has pretty colors and fits very well. i haven't washed it yet, but i like the idea that it can be machine washed. highly recommend. the fabric is good quality, a little bit thick for hot days though."
1," This piece is almost what i want... i tried on the white version in an xs and it felt a little too large for me, even though it's meant to be a looser fit. the buttercup yellow behind the lace is very pretty - i especially love that part of this tank. it provides a nice contrast and allows the detail to stand out. the navy is also nice (it was on display next to the white and looks better in person than online). what i didn't like was the texture of the spandex on the back portion. it looks like"
1,"Simply fantastic To sum up my review at the beginning: i walked out to my best friend and two retailer employees and all 3 of them stopped and said, ""whoa."" it's an understated stunner.
i tried this dress on a whim: and boy am i glad i did. i'm 5'4"", 140lb, 34b with weight carried on the bottom, usually wear a size 4 in fit and flare dresses: the size 2 fit like a glove here.
i'm shocked at just how incredible the lace is: thick, well laid on the base dress fabric, gorgeous without being too 'lacy'. the base fabri"
1,Very pretty. Lovely. my only issue is that the arm holes are rather large. i needed to wear a tank under so that my bra wouldn't show. very pretty.
1,Comfortable & stylish Love this tank. fits true to size & looks great with jeans or shorts. a bit disappointing that the back does not have the lace like the front (only on the top back).
1,"Beautiful dress I purchased this dress in our retailer store. i usually wear either a 0 or 2 petite (5'1"", 115 lbs.). i was able to wear a 0r in this and it fit perfectly. i paired it with a sparkly belt from retailer for a cocktail party and received lots of compliments."
1,"Cute and comfy top I got this top in a petite xs and it fit just as expected (i'm 5'2"", 112lbs). the material wears like a tee, so it's comfortable, but the front details give it a special look. this is going to be on my go-to list all summer."
0,"Bummed I was so excited to wear this shirt, even after reading the review that it curls up i decided to give this shirt a shot, and i found that the same thing happened to me. it also clings tightly to the body. i would not recommend this shirt for anyone with broad shoulders."
1, Beautiful top for summer. love the yellow under the thin white fabric. the photo is good representation. running big.
0,"Itchy! I have somewhat sensitive skin and this fabric is awful! in addition to it having no give, feeling like it will stretch out, and being slightly see-through, it is super scratchy!! it has little bits of what look to be tree material in the fabric.. awful!"
1,"Nice pants but size down So hard to guess fit and size so because i carry my weight in my tummy i ordered an xl. they were too big. the waistband is a nice, very wide, comfy elastic but fit loose. the legs were a bit baggy too and too long for my frame. the fabric is soft and has a bit of a contrast down the sides of the leg. due to the length, i decided not to reorder a smaller size. i think you'd be safe to size down in these."
1,"Decent little tee You won't break the bank with this cute tee. loved that it's not a thin fabric. the variation in the stripes adds interest, too. i ordered a large, my regular size, and it fit well. i returned because it was a bit on the long side on my short frame, the colors didn't suit me and i need long sleeve tees now that we're heading into the colder months."
1,Black and white shirt This shirt is even prettier in person. it's really flowy but still very flattering.
1,"Loved the dress but didn't fit me right This dress was absolutely beautiful in person, but it didn't end up working out for me. i wear a 10, the 10 fit, but i have a 34g chest and because of that the waistline didn't sit low enough - it was just below my bust instead of at my natural waist. i really wanted this to work and think it would be great for the right person. seemed tts. love the detailing!"
1,"For that perfect outfit Love this shirt- i got the white/yellow one and with a pair of dark jeans and booties i was ready for anything. i have an hourglass type figure, and sometimes with flowy shirts that is hidden. but this shirt somehow subtly emphasized that in an attractive way!"
1,"Very comfy These are a bit oversized, order a size down. they are a nice weight and look great under tunics."
1,"I like them but... First off: kudos to the other reviewers for setting the expectation re: the color on these! they are not a dark rinse at all - not even close. they're a light-to-medium hue with fading down the front of the thighs. with that in mind, i do like the color - especially for spring - but would have been very miffed had i ordered these and they arrived so starkly different from the online photo.
----------
i typically wear a 27-29, depending on the brand and waist rise. these were an online return t"
1,"Super cute, try on in store I would suggest trying this on in store. the xs would've worked (that's my normal size), but i ended up preferring the s. it does have low armholes. the s in the yellow was just right for me, but the s in the navy was too low in the armholes and the shirt was cut a little crooked. still, a very cute and classic top that i know i'll get a lot of use out of."
1,"Very feminine & soft! I really love this top! fits true to size, romantic lace detail. also love the white underlay panel for contrast. extremely comfortable soft fabric. so many ways to dress this top up or down."
1,Adorable as a regular top not sleep I bought this cuz i wanted a plaid shirt that didnt have too much plaid..this is true to size and adorable! i will be wearing it out and not to bed or for lounge. adorable detailing on back and on shoulders...its a keeper!
0,"Wanted to love it but i don't I am very into the lace tops! purchased this but it's a very exaggerated swing top and on someone who is 5'3, it feels almost like a tunic. lots of extra material in the back. love the look and if you're tall enough, it should work for you!"
0,"Not the right color I ordered these twice just to be sure there wasn't a glitch. the color is so off! the picture shows a dark blue denim, but they are not they are a light blue - with whiskering! retailer you need to have a better image of the color because this is so misleading."
0,"Armholes too large With a rather large chest, i am always having to size up in tops like this. the l fit well all over but the arm holes were just too low. even if i wore a navy bra (i got the navy version) it would still be cut too low. it's too bad because it is a beautiful and unique piece"
1,"Very special, but zipper could be better I picked this dress up in a size 8 - fits tts. i have a 34dd chest; 145 lbs. and 5 ft. 4 inches in height. i have an hourglass figure and the size 10 was too big and the 8 fit just right. the skirt is lined and the upper bodice part is not, it says on the tag hand wash which is a plus because dry cleaning is not a plus. hits me just about 2 inches above the knee. the thick lace detailing is very special and price point with the dress promo made me feel this would be a great dress for the holiday"
0,"Could have been great but just ok Love the detail of the white with yellow underneath but agree with the other reviewer that the material is very thin in the back. also, it is a flowly top so you will need to size down. however, because of the shape it will fit snuggly around the chest/arms. this didn't work for me as it accentuated my normal body type (as in not the model type). i am not overweight but it definitely didn't flatter my chest area. seems like the top worked for others so i suggest trying on first."
1,"Not so bad! I actually like this top, but i am wearing it as a cowl neck rather than off-the-shoulder. i found it at the store, so i didn't even know it was supposed to be that way. i have the ivory color, and it it does have some tan/beige specks in it, but i don't mind this at all, it adds some texture and warmth. i think it is a great neutral top for work. it has a double layer of fabric, so not sheer at all, and this keeps it smooth over my middle without a tank or cami. 

i am an xs in most retailer to"
1," It's a very cute design. it looks great tucked into a cute pair of jeans, if can even be dressed up. however, i agree with the previous comments about the top not staying folded down. it likes to ride up and is difficult to keep the style like the model in the picture has. it's a very cute design, it just needs to be worked with and adjusted time and time again as its worn. when it does cooperate, i've gotten many compliments on it! order a size up, i am normally a small but the medium worked be"
1,"Love this top! I ordered this top online. i had been wanting an off-the-shoulder top in a neutral color and when i found this one, i had to have it! i thought the price was great. when i received it, i was impressed with the quality of material. it fit me a little more tightly than some of my other tops, but was very satisfied with how it looked on my body! i got it in a size small. i do agree with others on here, the shoulders were a little more difficult to keep folded down...but overall...i am truly satisfi"
1," I wanted this this top when i saw it online but was hesitant when i read the review however i went to the store and was able to try it on, good thing. i'm not a fan of the off white/beige material but really like the black style. i had no problem with the shoulders staying down. idid get it in a small a size up for me."
1,"Classic Beautiful, well made and styled dress. perfect for company christmas parties where you want to look nice but not show too much cleavage. i wear it with a cameo brooch."
0,Disappointing - shoulders don't stay down I love off the shoulder looks and had high hopes for this top. unfortunately the folded top portion doesn't stay down at all. i found myself pulling at it all day and eventually gave up. the material is also not the best.
1,"A little on the short side I purchased this top in the wine color and found it to be cute and comfortable. the sleeves are not tight which is nice, but it is very short and moving your arms away from our sides make this shirt look a little bit like a tent. the color is pretty and the button detail is nice.
overall good purchase, but i'm glad i got it on sale!"
1,"Nice flowy summer tank I just got this tank and love it. it has the perfect amount of swing, but does run a little large. the underlay was more yellow than i expected, but i think it adds a nice amount of brightness to the top. this will be a summer staple."
1,Flattering! This top is the epitome of late summer and getting into fall mood. it's soft fabric falls nicely on top of skinny jeans. the open shoulders are trendy and flattering!
1,"Love love love ?? Love this top. tried it on in the store and had to have it. did not find it too sheer and could wear my regular bra with it, as the shoulders fit where the straps are. got tons of compliments on it. would have bought in more colors if offered i loved it that much. the perfect bohemian hippie chic top, if there is such a style!"
0,Unflattering Fight a bit snug over the bust then widens like a bell. not as cute as it looks in the photo. returned.
1,"Overall a great shirt I noted that this runs large- i should say it runs wide. it is supposed to be flowy like in the picture, but i am really swimming in the l. that being said, i worry that if i returned for a m that it would be too short in the front. i am 5'10 for reference, and i would say the length in front is a little shorter than i would like, but it still works. the black and white print is beautiful- i paired it today with dark skinny jeans and received compliments. other reviews about the batwing sleeves"
1,Great easy to wear machine washable!!! This is a great easy to wear summer dress. a denim jacket would look adorable to wear on a cooler night. it runs a bit small in the waist and i bought the petite because i wanted it to be above the knee summer casual. it is very flattering because of the pattern detail by the waist. it is the perfect summer dress and best of all it is machine washable!
0,"Odd fit I really wanted to like this top, but unfortunately it is not as pretty or flattering in person. the yellow looks dirty in real life, not pretty like the picture. it is also a strange fit/shape when it is on. i tried it on in the store and did not like it at all."
1,Nice summer top Runs large under arms i am typically a size medium but bought size small.
0," I fell in love with these online. i thought they would be such a nice piece of statement denim. unfortunately they did not work for me. i am 5'2"" and the waist of these paints was four inches away from my breasts. it didn't look bad from the back but from the front it was comical. the denim itself is nice and heavy but, like the previous reviewer stated, not a dark wash. the pair i received was a medium whiskered wash. if i was taller these would have been a yes, despite the wash discrepancy."
1,Beautiful details Love this top. the beautiful and delicate details are wonderful. the cut is a loose fit which is great. it works with tailored trousers and jeans
1," I love this top! shows off the shoulders but a normal bra works. no tank needed. not too boxy looking, all these things i have had a problem in some of the currant tops an retailer. i felt it was flattering and comfortable with some country chic. i found the colors to be a bit more rich than online. there was a tiny bit of puffy fabric around the back upper shoulder, but nothing to worry about. the neckline is a stretchy and close fitting, and that's the part of the top that i don't usually wear i"
1,"Versatile jacket I purchased the grey jacket first and it seems to work with a lot of things and create different looks. so i purchased the tan jacket. i found it to less tan as an olive color. not my favorite color for me. but the fit is awesome and hopefully the color will prove to be versatile too. the blouse shown with it does not go with it as i had hoped.
the jacket seems very green with the golden brown in the blouse. so a black or ivory blouse with some great necklace should work. recommend. pretty true"
1,"Perfect for almost any weather I love this top. i bought it in the blue but loved all the colors. i fell in love with it on-line and hesitated ordering it only because i was afraid that the arm holes would be too large (based on what i saw in the picture). fortunately they had it at my local retailer, so i was able to try it on. my usual xs fit perfectly. great flow, soft and casual. perfect for those cool nights in the summer or layered with a cardigan in the winter."
1,Beautiful dress Love the colors of this dress. it did run a little large. i ordered a large and medium and went with the medium.
1,"Great buy! 36dd, 10/12 in tops, 12/14 in bottoms

this tank is amazing! the flowing a-line shape is very flattering. the armholes are perfect - all too often i see a good tank top ruined by large, gaping armholes. no bra peek-a-boo here! fabric is a stretch micro-rib knit that doesn't cling too tightly, just enough to give the top good definition. i took the size large for the length - just past the hips on me. the side slits keep the look flowy. the light blue contrast color is light grey, while the brigh"
1,"Love this top!! I purchased this in the blue motif.  i am 5'4, 118 pounds and got an xs. i love everything about this tee. it looks great with jeans and i love it with my white denim shorts! i haven't worn it off the shoulder yet.  i think it looks great as a regular tee. i get compliments whenever i wear it.  so happy with this purchase!"
1,"Cool military jacket This is such a cool military jacket. when i saw it displayed on a table at my local retailer, i knew it was going home with me. this is my 4th marrakech jacket, i love their style. i bought the black in my usual size large, and i agree with the previous reviewer, if you have a chest this is a very flattering jacket. i usually wear my jackets open, and i discovered that if you button back the lapels at the second button down it looks amazing and not so sloppy. it kind of bothered me the way"
1,"Love this vest I am normally not a vest person, however i saw this and had to try it. it is awesome and on sale. i am 5' 3"" and 128 pounds and the small fit perfectly."
0,"Not my favorite Not in love with this one. the fabric is thin and seems cheap... it seems overpriced even on sale. and it runs a bit small along the bust. i could maybe get away with it without a bra, but after 3 kids, braless isn't my best look. and i don't think the print is a pretty in person as it is online - can't quite put my finger on why... maybe a little darker in person. that said, the fit is flattering. the cinched waist is lovely, and the skirt is nice and flowy. even so, this one is going back."
1,"Great staple piece Love, love, love this jacket! i'm able to dress it up or casual. the hint from a review i read to button the lapels back worked awesome. good quality, has a bit of stretch for bulky shirt to wear underneath. would definitely recommend if like the military jacket style."
1,"Purchased two - had problems with one. I purchased this top in the blue stripe and red. after washing the red top, it lost color in little spots and also has little holes along the seams. the blue washed fine. overall, it is a very cute top and great for summer."
1,"Classic winter I am so glad that i got this one.i wish i got the bigger size,but got it on sale.i am glad,that i have it for next winter."
1,Love this I'm obsessed with this top. i actually love that the sides are a bit higher than the front and back. i feel like that gives it shape. i bought jeans similar to the pic here and they look so good together. love!
1,"Pretty, colorful top Saw this top online and hoped for the best. my hopes were rewarded! lovely lightweight summery top but i think with a cardigan it could be worn in the fall also. i asked 4 friends if they liked it and they all agreed it was very flattering so i decided it was a keeper. have worn it three times since purchasing and have received lots of compliments."
0,Will not stay down I ordered a med petite. usually this fits but this shirt was long and the sleeves wouldnt stay down. as a regular shirt it was not cute.
1,"Tiny pant! I am a 4, so i ordered the s. slipped these pants on and i couldn't get them zipped up. i thought perhaps i ordered a 0, nope, a s. i'm not even sure a m would fit! these unfortunately are going back tomorrow. the material and color were beautiful (bronze), but the sizing is very strange!"
1,Cute style I love this jacket. it's easy to dress up or be casual. the black is more like a very dark grey.
1,"Super cute and flattering I am in love with this bathing suit. it is super cute and flattering and i love the pattern on this specific style. it is also seems to be very well made. i haven't worn it in the water yet so i can't really speak to that. i would say that i believe it is true to size, which means that it is a little tight since bathing suits need to be tight to stay on in the water! for reference i am a bra size 32dd, around 130 pounds, and 5'5"" and a size 6 fits perfectly."
0,"Hidden tailoring faux pas The image does not show but the front of the dress has a heavy 24"" utility zipper hidden with 5 snaps. the zipper pull, when closed, sat right on my collarbone, which was he height of discomfort. it felt heavy and awkward. the dress was very high waisted for me (i'm 5'6"" and it was 3"" inches above the navel)) also to the point of discomfort.

an invisible side zipper would have made the difference for me if the proportions were better suited for a non-petite sizing.

the fabric is quite beautifu"
1,"Cute top The lining is shorter than the top, so i keep pulling it down. also the finishing of the edges looks like a child cut it with some scissors. it is not evenly cut. i do like the color and style of the shirt, just not the quality."
1,Love the length One of my favorites for comfy cute this summer! the color is a beautiful berry color! also love the length... it feels a little longer than a typical top which i love! 5'9
1,"Not quite right I tend to size up when ordering tops online as i find a lot of retailer stuff to be inconsistent. a little big is better than something way to small. well that was a mistake with this top. i sized up and it was much too large everywhere, more so than i thought it would be. but the neck, there's no button or hook and i could barely get the top over my head! if i had gotten a size smaller i wonder if it would have ripped as i pulled it on. cute top, material is so-so."
0,"Beautiful top, wrong execution This is such a beautiful top with pretty, vivid colors and soft fabric but the execution is wrong. the front is fine, the smocked upper portion is very flattering but then you turn around and the back fits like a cape. there is a ton of fabric especially in the upper portion of the shoulders and upper back, with pleats that begin under the ruffled neck and billow out. i got an xxsp (5'  103 lbs) so couldn't size down. please retailer no more billowy tops!!
so sad to have to return this one."
1,"Awesome! Love marrakech for their jackets! this piece is wonderful! i usually wear an xs or s in this brand in jackets. i went with an xs as the sleeve are a little loose. the body still fits buttoned up- nice and tailored. the stretch keeps in comfy with the tailored fit in the trunk. looks great worn open too. i think the best part is the cut and material. i am 5 '4 and 125 lbs, curvy."
0,"High hopes that were dashed... I was so excited about this top, as the picture of the model it looks beautiful and drapey in just the right way. unfortunately, this top feels like an old grandma's polyester suit, the sides are much shorter than the front & back and the combo of the inner lining and the outer fabric feels awkward with the inner piece being significantly shorter the the outer. it also puffed out a bit at the top of the shoulders in a strange way, due to the layered fabric. 

sadly, going back."
1,"Breezy and sexy I received this top in my normal xxsp size and it fits perfect. it's roomy so i'm glad i went with the smallest size. the color states pink but it's really between a red and raspberry so it's better looking than pictured. as with most off the shoulder tops, if you raise your hands it slips up, but it actually looks good that way too and forms a square around the neck that appears like that's the natural design. overall, great value, light and flowy, plus the fabric is a soft linen so it breathes"
0,Unflattering This dress was really odd. i loved the quirky mixture of the blue stripe and the floral but that's about it. the shape was unflattering but honestly that could be because this dress ran large. i was just very underwhelmed with this dress. also the hidden button zipper at the front was an amazing idea but not the best execution. overall its okay just hated it on me.
1,"Not so much I carefully read the reviews and decided to order a medium since that size works for me generally with floaty styles. the neck was a bit small but once over my head it fit and looked nice. the deal breaker for me is the huge droopy armholes that showed half my bra. the colors are deeper than shown. but the pattern and length overwhelmed my shape feeling a lot like a maternity top. i liked that the sides are shorter but overall it's just not my style. better suited i think for taller, slimmer bod"
1,"Too itchy I ordered the blue stripe and white in size large. i didn't like it worn off shoulder but it does stay in place, which is a good thing. and it looks okay worn on the shoulders. i find the fabric so uncomfortable and itchy that i couldn't wait to take it off, immediately. i tried them on again a second time, still hopeful, with the same outcome. sadly, returning."
1,"Perfect top Everything about this top is perfect! quality is great which is number one in my book. color is awesome! perfect color for fall, summer and spring! a must have!!"
1,"Waiting for summer days I love linen i know it's a pain with the wrinkles but it's just a very nice crisp clean feel. this vest is wonderful it fits very nice, once you size down, and can work as a bathing suit cover up. i'm using it with my linen pants and skirts and everyone has asked me where did you get that...i think they're all gone by now but if they aren't grab it while you can it's a must have for any woman's closet."
1,Good for d cups This suit is so flattering on! great support and slimming for my post-three times baby body. i ordered this suit and the skirted maillot by swim by retailer in the white floral. i loved the pattern of the floral more but don't think any chest size larger than a c cup would be supported in that suit.
1,Great top Was looking for a cute off the shoulder top and this is a fun one. can be worn both on or off the shoulders. nice length and the pink is a beautiful raspberry color. love the linen blend too. i'm a size 2 and i ordered the xs. flows away from body - -it's a bit big but i like the style.
1,Great top! This top is great. it hangs in the perfect way to hide imperfections. the orange/red is a great accent and i received compliments when i wore it.
1,"Cool and comfy tunic Really like this tunic a lot. it is comfortable and easy to throw on and look put together. i'm always a fan of pockets too! i ordered the xs -- i'm 5'4"" about 118#. it fits loose but not in a bad way. the fabric allows it to fall well over the body. if you are tall it will probably be too short for you as it was a few inches above my knees. glad to have snagged this right away! more tunics like this please!"
1,"Top of the season If all the tops i ordered from retailer this summer, this top is my fav. it is a crowd pleaser! my friend called it my ""art shirt."" the fabric is nice and the cut hangs nice on my 5 ft 5 170 pound frame. the armholes are a little big, so i just wear a red bra with it and it's great."
1,"Love I'm about 5'5"" and normally about 120 lbs so i purchased the small. i'm currently 9 months prego, but i couldn't resist this jacket! i purchased anyway and although it doesn't fit over my belly right now, i'm looking forward to being able to wear it soon! it will be perfect for the chilly office or a casual day. the fabric is beautiful with just the right amount of stretch. like others have said, it has a bit of a navy-ish tint to to it, so it's not truly black. thanks retailer for offering anothe"
1,"Runs big and short This dress is shorter than it looks on the model. i'm 5'8"" and it hits about 1 inch above my knee. it also runs a little big in my opinion."
1, I love purchasing these tunic/ruffle dresses because they can be worn anywhere.....this dress is definitely a little on the heavy side for winter wear...the color is beautiful...i am 5'4''. 138 pounds and always purchase a large for a relaxed fit....i plan to wear it out to dinner for my birthday and to a house party on new years day....
1,"Pretty off the shoulder top I was looking for an off-the-shoulder top and chose this one. it is pretty. the bottom of the shirt is fairly billowy, so i can only wear with skinny pants. takes a little getting use, somewhat restricting my arm movement so the shirt pops off my upper arms."
1, Loves it!! this is my new favorite top. it's pretty...it's perfect:-) cannot find any bad to say about it.
1, This top is well made for the price! the colors are beautiful and will work well with jeans and a leather jacket if it is cooler.
1, Just gorgeous . this is one beautiful top. the colors are pretty and vibrant. i wear either a large or xl and the large was great in this top. dress it up or down.this top flows and it drapes beautifully in the back. it looks fantastic with jeans. as a bonus it is lined so no need for any type of piece under it. it's an all year round top. throw a cardigan or wrap over it when the weather cools down and you are set to go. a great top for your wardrobe . i would not hesitant to buy it.
1," For me, at 5'9"", the top was not long enough...it appeared longer in the photo. i'll be returning it. other than length, it is cute."
0,"Cute off the shoulders, meh in reality Pros: soft, quality top, true to size, and would look great (a little tucked in) and off the shoulder

reality: it will be hard to keep the shoulders from sliding up, and (on me at least) it looked really meh...kind of dumpy.

i'm 5'6"", normally a medium/8, and i bought the medium here...fit was good. it's billowy and accurately displayed in the pictures, so as an hour-glass shaped gal, i'd need to tuck in the front (or all) or accessorize to give it a little shape. i really liked the feel a"
1,"Great top for taller gals Tried this one because the ruffled detailing at the collar and sleeves appealed to me, as well at the cute button details along the back and the overall color and look of it.
_____________
pros:
- love the ruffle trim along the collar, bottom, and wrists. it gives it a really romantic feel to it.
- a definite winter piece. it's extremely warm and very thick and heavy, which i found covered any lumps and bumps nicely.
- ran tts. i'm 5'9"", 36c, hourglass, and 170 lbs and tried on the medium and fo"
1,"Great casual jacket I'm glad i took a chance and ordered this jacket. i love military inspired jackets and this one is very cute.
it runs a little big, so i'm glad i ordered a size down. i like that it can be worn open or buttoned. it looks great with jeans and boots but i can wear it to work as well. it's definitely more on the casual side, but still a very versatile piece in my closet. love it."
1,Cute idea but so big and long even in petite This truly is a dress and not a tunic. i normally wear a medium but they were sold out so i thought i would try a l petite. i am only 5'4 and the large p was really long. i could definitely wear as a dress with tights. i am hoping it comes back in stock so i can try a medium p. unfortunately it is going back. cute sweater as pictured on the model!
1,"Soft halter top for longer waist This chambray halter top is a good summer staple from cloth and stone, but, it is better for longer waists than mine (and, smaller busts). 
fyi: 36c, broad shoulders/back, short waist - normally i wear a m in c&s, and that is what i tried in this halter top.
oddly the overall length was okay, but the armholes were very low. in the m, the bust area was tighter than it should have been for a easy summer top. i think that this is due to the overall length of the bodice. in other words, the top ha"
1,"High quality, size up This skirt is a beautiful fabric, heavy and soft, and fully lined. it has two sets of snaps on the inside so you can adjust the waist size. i purchased a medium, but found that there wasn't enough of an overlap in the split to be decent (it flaps open when i walk, revealing nearly everything!), so i will be exchanging for a large. for reference, i typically wear a size 10 or 12 in pants and skirts. the color is true to the photos, with a matte finish. i am 5'8"" and length hit me below the knee."
1,Soft & pretty Bought the blue/gray - love the color. just the right amount of cling. adorable alone or under cardigan. super deal on sale.
1,"Versatile and cute! This cardigan is very cute and versatile. the knit is medium weight and will work well for moderate weather. i would say that the sizing is pretty true to size, but maybe runs just a bit large. thus, if you are in between sizes, order the smaller size."
0," I loved the actual design on the fabric. the flowers are gorgeous and i was really looking forward to wearing them, but the fabric was much too thin for me. i was surprised because another review said they were thick. to me, it felt like tights material, almost. however, they were not see through, which is great. overall, they just didn't look great on my body. 5'9"" size 6/8 curves, medium was a bit too loose."
1,"Beautiful relaxed sweatshirt Love this sweatshirt! i'm 5'2"" 110lbs and ordered the x-small. it's a little boxy but very comfy. it's definitely light peach in color and not pink, as shown. very happy with this purchase!"
1," I wanted these jeans so badly! i originally ordered them in my regular size -a 27. they were too big even for a tomboy fit, so i ordered a 26. the size 26 order was backordered and then cancelled. i am so sad! i would absolutely buy these if i could get them in my size. they are so soft and beautiful. i love ag's quality."
1,"Beautiful I bought one of these as a gift for a friend and i loved it so much i had to get one for myself! it's beautiful material and has lovely detail, a little sheer so best worn with a cami underneath. probably better for those with not too ample busts as it doesn't have a lot of stretch."
1, Even more beautiful in person. runs large as i'm usually a medium and bought a small. great for summer/fall transition.
1,Dressy casual Great sweater with gorgeous detail. fits tts. works best in someone with smaller bust like me. pink is peachy pink like other reviewers have commented. pairing it with gray ag jeans! will work great for fall/winter in louisiana.
1,"Delicate and dress up top Very pretty and delicate top. it is fresh and with a delicate embroidered ""bib"" style. the fabric on the front is silky and the back is a blend of silk and cotton, just that part (the back) could be a little thicker so more durability. still as it is, it's a niece piece and good quality.
i find it you can wear it with dress pants for office or formal gathering and to dress up jeans and either to leave it our or tuck in. since the bib is focal point you can skip any necklace and war dainty earrin"
1,"Pretty, but... When i first saw this top online, i thought it is very common beach like cover up, give or take. the main point of attraction for me was the cobalt blue silk trim. very vibrant looking color and very attractive. cough my eye for sure. however, when it arrived i was really surprised, how the top turned out to be. 1. much larger than expected, very roomy. 2. cobalt blue turned out to be not so bright, in fact, not even that interesting as it stands out in the photo. not too bad, but unexpected, i"
1,"Beautiful dress for fall This is a beautiful dress for fall. the fabric is gorgeous and drapey and the skirt is swingy. i ordered this in an xl because that size always sells out first. i think a l might fit a bit better, so i will see if any more come in and order another to compare. it poofs out in the back above the elastic and the waist slides down a bit. it is also very long, i need to hem it about 3-4"". i never know which size to order with this brand, i vary between l and xl."
1," Nice thin tank. back half is a jersey knit (different fabric than the front). good layering piece. at 5'4"" 140 lbs, the medium is a nice length, reaching my hip flexors in front ...although, i'm rather short waisted..."
0,Silly short This top was very cute but super short- and i am a short waisted petitie person-the waistline hits above your belly button- looks very silly.
1,Love This sweater is really fun and even cuter in person.
1,"Great sweater Colors are much brighter in person, fits well (not frumpy like a lot of open-front sweaters). colors make it perfect for neutrals but maybe hard to mix with other colors. pricey, so still considering whether to keep it."
1,"So cute, but not for me This suit is so adorable! i love the retro style and the two patterns and i really wish it worked for me. the suit is comfy, seems well made and fit nicely. but, although it fit technically, i don't like the way it cuts me off at the thigh. it's not flattering for me at all. 

the suit is kind of a neoprene material, so it's thicker than a normal bathing suit, so i think even though it isn't lined, it might not be see-through, but i didn't get it wet to test it out. in terms of fit, i think it"
0,"Cute design, impossible fit I tried this on in my regular size and was able to get it on fine, but the cup portion of the suit was just crazy! with the straps tied tightly around my neck, it was like the cups just flipped out and open. i am a regular b cup, and i don;t think it was sizing (though i did not have the opportunity to try multiple sizes). the cup did not right and, for this reason, would make this absolutely impossible to wear. unfortunate, because the design is so pretty."
0,"Short mumu On me, thsi was ginormous, looked like a mu mu. it is pretty, but there was just too much fabric, even in the smallest size. the quality seems nice, and it looks pretty, but overwhelming. i will say, i think it would work on tail lean people, i have pretty muscular shoulders, so the off shoulder look with that much fabric made me look 30 pounds heavier, no joke. fabric is soft though. give it a try, just not for me...

ref: 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist."
1,Love these I love the unique design and the fit. they are very flattering. they might be a little too thick to wear in the summer but the rest of the year they will work out great.
1,"Runs small This is a well made and nice looking top.the gathering around the neck adds to the overall look of the shirt, but it also affects the way it fits. i got my usual size medium and it was tight in the shoulders and arm holes. i regret that i had to send it back."
1,Cups too big This suit itself is adorable. i usually have to get a size large for length but in this case the cups are way too big. it says light padding but there is no padding. just a giant empty cup. i'm going to order the size medium.
1,"Lovely for late summer/early fall This dress is just lovely. beautiful drape, comfortable material. it is a print that looks like embroidery. i am usually an xs or s, and i'm glad i got the xs as i can tell the s would have been too large. the back waistband is elastic and it is easy to move in. beautiful neutral colors. i think it can be dressed up or down easily with the right shoes and jewelry. only negative comments- there is only a half slip and i wish it was lined more, although that will make it easier to wear during the"
1," I was surprised how much i like this shirt. the fit is really pleasing. at first i thought it would be a ""whatever"" shirt, but i think i will actually wear it a lot more. it will look cute dressed up with a cute necklace and flats. the price is a bit high for this top, but i felt it was worth it since it is so hard finding a casual shirt thats not your basic tee."
1,So cutest Ok. love this top. i'm 5'4 106 34b and the 0 reg fits perfect on the top half. i am going to have the waist taken in because i love the top. it is very short. i usually need a petite but the regular is just barely long enough. i thought it was red and white but it is red and beige. great with jeans or navy for work.
1,"Great fall piece The colors in this cardigan are not what they look like on line. the top is navy and the lower arms are grey. the sweater overall has more punch than pictured. this is a cotton sweater and a great fall layering piece. it will look great with a tee shirt and jeans. it is a long sweater, but not too long as to swallow a smaller person up. i also really like that the front is not too flowy. i am looking forward to wearing this all fall."
1,"Pretty piece This is a pretty everyday piece to add to your wardrobe. the color is a little less pink and more peach than depicted in the photo and the top is just a bit on the short side but i was afraid that if i sized up, it wouldn't give me more length but maybe look boxy instead. i'm 5'7"", 140lbs, 32dd with an athletic build and ordered the small."
1,"Comfy & casual This sweater is super cute. it has nice weight to it and is just a nice casual but attractive piece to wear with jeans or white pants. love that it zips and just a really cute pattern of marigold, mint/teal and grey/dark gray."
0,So cute but design failure I am usually a size o and ordered and xs ...due to the band in the center (not much give) it was a little difficult to shimmy over my hips but the body fit perfectly when i got passed that part. that being said the cup design is a hot mess. i am a b/c cup size and the top on this could not handle it. i felt fully exposed. i thought maybe if i went a size up i could get a little more coverage. the body felt ok on the small but the cups were still just too small. i still felt to exposed. they are
1,Love this top Loved this top when i first saw it online and when it arrived it didn't disappoint at all. dress it up or down.
1,"Beautiful dress This dress is so beautiful! i ordered it online and when i received it i was so pleased with how it was even better in person. the fit, the embroidery, the lovely fall colors - makes this a perfect dress all the way around!"
0,"Runs very small Am typically a size 0 and could barely get the extra small on, which is a first. was very cute in theory, but i'd suggest sizing up (maybe 2x)."
1,"Cute weekend top Not as pink as pictured online, definitely more of a pale peach. fits loose, so i'm glad i went with my normal size, or would seem boxy. cute top, and will wear it around town running errands..instead of my activewear!"
1,"Great sweater The photos really doesn't do this sweater justice. when i saw it in store ii was really drawn to the colors which are a bit brighter than they appear in the photos. this will be great over jeans or slim pants. i usually wear a l or xl and i went with the l which is still roomy enough to layer but not too big. at 5'5"" it drapes nicely and covers my rear end. the arms are a bit long on me but it is a common issue for me as i have short arms. others have mentioned the arms being big but i think the"
1,"Super cute * runs small I love the design of the suit and decided to take a chance and order despite the mixed reviews. i'm so happy i did! i couldn't be happier with the fit, quality and design. for reference, i am 5'8, size 4 and smaller chested (small b cup) and went with a medium. i could see that this suit might not work for everyone but i love it!"
0,"Bad cups! The cups on this suit are  ridiculous.  unless you are going to a nudist beach i do not recommend.  the construction of the suit itself was also vey poor. seams were messed up, a big pull right on the front-- i brought it back. sad because the design was adorable- just poor execution."
1," I just purchased this blouse in store! the fabric has a nice weight and drape, feels nice to the touch and is opaque. i'll be wearing this one as a dress and a top. i'm 5'2"" and this fell a couple inches above my knee. i typically wear an xs at retailer and opted to go with a small for the extra length and because i hate when off the shoulder silhouettes pop up and become not so off the shoulder. i laid the xs and small out to compare sizing and didn't notice a major  difference width wise. i typi"
1,"Cute but hits a little short I really wanted to love this top! it's cute and fitted- fits well, but just hit me a tad higher than i wanted. i tried a size 2 and it fit perfectly--but with no extra room. i'm 5'5""-34c. normally wear a 2."
1,"Updated basic Loving this top! feels comfy and casual like a sweatshirt, but pairs great with a pencil skirt or dress pants to wear to work. easy to dress up and down and i get so many compliments on it! it's fraying a tiny bit on the front, but i think that adds to the not-so-precious vibe. i'm 5'10"" 160# and the m works great!"
1,"Great shirt I love this top.  the fit is great for me. i ordered a small. the color is a bit more peach than the pink in the picture,  but still very cute."
1,Fabulously comfortable and stylish Love this gorgeous off the shoulder top! very comfortable and stylish. you can wear it either off the shoulder or not!
1,"Pretty top This top is really cute for the right body shape.
it is tight around the bust area if you select your size and sizing - you lose the shape."
1,"Beautiful lace I loved this blouses when i saw it on-line, but when i saw it in on me it looked totally different. it runs really large and i didn't like the material of blouse."
1,New fave pants! Love the look of these- casual or dressy depending on what you pair with them. they are so comfortable! edgy but relaxed - joggers with a leather look- what more could you ask for?
1,Wonderful quality Received a lot of compliments when i wore this sweater. quality is wonderful. only thing i noticed is that it's a little shorter in length then what i was expecting.
1,"Size down! I ordered this item before seeing the july 25th review. i ordered in a s and need an xs. now the xs is sold out unfortunately. my waist measures 27"", hips 32"", and i am 5'4"". the material very nice, has elastic for movement and comfort. i would wear this all the time if i had the correct size. it would be cute dressed down or up."
0,"Disappointing The skirt in person is not like the picture. baggy and runs large. i wear jean size 25 and the xs is two size too loose. there's no pocket which is surprising on a denim. the slit in front makes the skirt  look even loose , no shape near what's in the picture. and there's no petite sizes. i am going to return it."
1,"Great suit! This suit is the most flattering suit i have owned in a while, as well as the most comfortable! though the suit is not lined, the light wetsuit material holds me in and is supportive, despite the open back and the slight looseness of it. if you do any water sports, i think this is a perfect suit. i did purchase some silicone covers for myself, however, to avoid looking like a farrah fawcett throwback."
1,"A perfect short sleeve top I've been scouting retailer's store, looking for short sleeved tops at a reasonable price point.
this fit the bill. the flouncy sleeves are a bit much for my typical wardrobe, but a fun addition. i love the fact that there's extra fabric built in to make the armholes smaller, therefore no need for a cami underneath.
i purchased the black and white in medium (typically medium to large, 5'4"", 34g)."
1,"Bettors off the shoulder top is a must! I fell in love with this top online and was even more pleased when it arrived. it's pure romance in a top. i went to the store and they didn't have it in yet, so i ordered it at the store. free shipping if ordered from store. i was extremely thrilled with everything about this purchase."
1,"Adorable top with cute details This is a charming sweatshirt top with extra details to make it stand out! the front panel has lovely art nouveau style embroidery and cut outs. i'm going to enjoy wearing this with jeans - it looks great with gray or black denim. the colors are fabulous for someone with ""spring"" coloring - the front panel is a very pale peach / peche. i'm 5'4"", 128lbs, with small shoulders and 32c chest, i'm typically a size 2-4 or size xs-s, and ordered an xs. it fits well, a little tighter than on the model -"
1,"Unique top I love, love, love this top! the cutout pattern in front is such a unique look and is a great way to add some fun to your usual t-shirt and jeans look. it's well made and the fit is great. i got it in petite s which worked great length-wise."
1,"Too small Love the top, but very small to the size. ordered a medium and had to send back in exchange for x-large."
0,Short I also wanted to love this top but sadly had to return it because it is very short and the peplum piece is very wide. it was not flattering at all.
1,"Great staple for fall In the fall and winter, i live in my uniform of skinny jeans, boots and a long sweater. this cardigan will be perfect! the fabric is very nice quality and the colors are gorgeous. i can see myself wearing it over and over!"
1, Love this shirt it has a femine look with a casual style.
1,"Bright stripes/ rich material My local retailer store didn't have this item in stock so i ordered it online. maybe it's my perception of color, but in the photo the top block of color seems to be more of a muted blue/purple while in person the color is navy and the other stripes are far bolder than the muted colors of the photo. i still really like the look overall (even though i usually go for more neutral tones) and it running a little large made the sleeves of the size small long enough for my 5'10'"" frame so i may end up k"
1,"Great cut, gorgeous material This is the weirdest, greatest material. it feels as soft and as buttery as leather, but doesn't look like leather. it looks more like coated denim. only lighter. and stretchy. so you don't get the vibe you get from the vast majority of vegan leather--thick, rubbery junk trying to masquerade as the real thing.

also gorgeous: the cut. it's straight and slim, but with pleats so hip-less ladies like me look like we have some shape.

i got my regular size, and they fit beautifully, but they are not"
1,"Comfy, elegant, slimming I got compliments the moment i walked into the office with those. they look like leather so much, that i had to ensure some people that only some polyester had to ""die"" so i could wear them ;). i am slim, but i think those pants are cut so well and hang so nicely, they make everybody look slimmer, they are also super soft, very comjfortable and the pockets are big enough to hold my beloved smart phone securely without showing a bulge. the pants look very elegant when paired with the right shoes"
1,"Glad i got this in time Gorgeous flowy dress that's great for three seasons. thank you to the previous reviewers for the fit advice. size small was only available and it fits perfectly on me (i'm an m/l on top). i'm short and will have to hem because even with 3"" heels i kept stepping on the back skirt. bodice opening is wide and gapes too much so i will wear a cami bra or fashion tape or have an additional fastener sewn in. there are bright little balls of red trim and unexpected pops of violet embroidery, adding to t"
1,"Fits true to size - high quality I ordered the floral version of this swimsuit - what you can't really tell from the images is the darling, lavender stripe design that is in set opposite the floral. it's truly a darling suit, and very well made. the fit is very flattering, with oddly enough a conservative yet sexy appeal. i ordered a medium after reading the ""size up"" recommendations from other consumers - but, i've exchanged it for a small. the cup size was over-exaggerated in the medium - and, i had plenty of breathing room i"
1,"Cute but.... I purchased this top online, love the off the shoulder trend and this looked like it would be perfect for fall. nice fabric and lace detail but the top definitely runs big! i ordered an xl and it was beyond swimming on me. definitely order a size or two down! also, it is very long / tunic length. i love a tunic but it almost wore more as a dress than a top! overall, cute item and fabric but definitely order down!!"
1,"Great fall cardigan Very comfortable, well made, great with leggings or skinny jeans."
1,"Cute sweater This is a very well made sweater. it is a nice weight, great for cool mornings and evenings. i don't think you can dress this up but it is perfect with casual pants and jeans. i found it runs large but that makes it suitable for layering over other tops."
1,"Love! Love the lightweight fabric! looks great with skinny jeans. it is flowy, but flattering.
wearing it on my shoulders for work -"
1,"Cute, but feels cheaper than asking price I purchased this skirt on super-sale but i'm hesitant to keep it. it's not poorly made, just not as sturdy as i would expect a skirt of its price. that said, it's cute and comfortable. i wish it came in numbered sizes because the m is snug but i expect the l would be too big. has a good amount of stretch. shows underwear lines. love the style!"
0,"Cute but not comfortable I was wondering whether to purchase this top and decided last weekend during the 20% off event, i would splurge!!! i got the m as i'm tall (5'10"") and it does look a little strange on the arms atleast on my body. the sleeve is cut too high for me. i wish it was longer or even a long-sleeved item! the peach-apricot- nude colored fabric is a little uncomfortable and the fabric close to the neck is a different grey from the other sweatshirt pieces. the sweatshirt pieces aren't particularly soft eit"
0,"Cute idea, bad cut I wanted to love this top to go with a pair of red flats i also bought at retailer. but it's almost like a peplum crop top because the cut is short. the peplum piece also flares out rather dramatically. had to return it even though i love other tops from maeve."
0,"This product is deceiving This product looks great on the model, but for anyone with a normal body type, the band in the center is way too tight. i'm a 34a and wear a 27 pants and it was huge in the bust and too small in the waist and hips. the violet one looks much more blue in the photograph, it is truly lavender and purple. i really wanted to love this swimsuit, but instead i had to return it, pay for return shipping, and i am out about $20 now. very disappointed."
1,"Like wearing a hug This wrap is awesome. soft material, perfect length sleeves with thumb holes (!), and warm, great for layering."
1,"Beautiful tank When you order online, you can't always be sure of the quality or sizing you will get. like the other reviewers, i found this piece to be beautiful and well made. it's made from rayon and not sheer. the coral, cream, green, and light gray flowers really pop against the black fabric. this piece is meant to be swingy and loose. however, i started with a large but exchanged for a medium. it still feels a little loose so if you're undecided about sizes, order down."
1," Cute and comfortable. not sure i'd say it's worth the full price as it's not a very heavy jacket. it did suit my needs though and was otherwise what i was looking for, so i kept it and have enjoyed wearing it."
1,"A sweet embroidered top I just purchased this adorable tank on-line and already received it in my regular size small (34d-27-35) and it fits me tts. the material is actually made with 100% rayon, not polyester as it describes above which makes it even better. the embroidery very beautiful in person as well and the arm openings are just right, not too large for a nice change. if you need a cute tank in black with a little something special, this is the top for you!"
0,Very cute online I bought this because i loved it online but in person there is another level to the shirt that i did notice in another picture. i didn't like the second level on me since i am a shorter person. just didn't fit my body quite right.
1,"It's a big, beautiful sweater Without seeing the 'online exclusive' notation, i went into my local retailer store to try on this sweater because sometimes i wear small and sometimes a medium. once the very helpful retailer employee looked it up and advised they don't carry it in stores, i ordered it at the check-out desk in a size medium. i was so excited with anticipation because i love stripes and i love the color gray... this sweater was right up my alley. i was very disappointed when i decided to return it. first of all, i d"
1,"Gorgeous top, perfect for summer To be honest, i bought this as a pregnancy top since i can't bring myself to buy actual maternity wear. it is gorgeously made of lovely light material, and i can actually see myself wearing it even after baby. i find the asymmetrical hemline to be really chic - overall a fave."
0,"Baggy I loved the lines in this jacket, but ended up returning it because they didn't show up how i expected. the jacket had a surprisingly baggy fit (s on my usual s/4/6) and wasn't quite what i was looking for."
1,"Super soft I saw this online and loved it, then when it was on sale i went into the store and tried it on and i couldn't resist. the only size that was left in stores was an xs petit and i didn't think that it would fit me because i am usually a regular s/m but it was super comfortable and very stylish. it wasn't too big or too small, it fit me just right without any awkwardness."
1,"Yup, no ruffle. Sooo this adorable blouse is indeed different than pictured. no ruffle, such a bummer, sleeves are much longer, and yes it's teared in the front and back. also the button opening on the back is much longer/larger, in my opinion. i'll most likely keep it, but consider the mentioned if buying."
1,"Everything about these joggers is positive! The fit, the length, the color, the fabric... cannot say anything negative at all! the sales associates at the store where i tried them on said they had just gotten them in, and she could not wait to see how they looked on. they were just as awed as i was! the pants can easily be dressed up or down.. the brown color is so, so, beautiful! i would expect these to be twice the price for such a high quality pant.  i consider it a timeless cut and can worn for seasons to come."
1," Cute, comfortable dress. great for work and more casual events. the neckline is more mock style than i was expecting."
1,"Beautiful detail I am in love with this top! i saw it online, and i was a bit nervous to order it because it's a little pricy for a tank top, and i was worried it was going to be too short on me. i was so wrong! the detail on the top is so beautiful, and looks even better in person! it hit me right at mid hip, and looks so cute with jeans and sandals. i sometimes get frustrated with the cut of the arms with retailer clothes because they are cut so low that you see your bra when you lift your arms, but this top is"
1,"So comfy and cozy! I love to layer and this is a great layering piece. it is wonderful for cool crisp mornings . this cardigan looks great with skinny jeans and a cute tee. the model in the photo shows a super way to look great for a casual day. so soft and comfortable, i did not want to take it off on the cloudy day it was worn. very happy with this purchase and delighted i was able to get it on sale."
0,"Pretty but runs way too small I really was looking forward to this piece but unfortunately it was too small to even pass through my head nevertheless i couldn't even get both arms in. i got a size small and probably needed a large; but as far as the quality and color, it's really pretty! just go up a size or two if anything and try it out."
0,"Meh This dress has very pretty colors on the embroidery, there is nothing wrong with the dress, other than the fact that there is nothing special about it. very blah fit. the fabric feels very polyester. no real shape to it. the embroidery on the dress i tried was lined up like the photo, so no problems there, just nothing about the dress made me want to wear it. perhaps at a much lower price point, but at this price point, its disappointing. size 2 fit perfectly, and i am 5'2"" 112. in general, just"
1,"Cute but not as pictured So this is still a pretty cute shirt, but my xs is missing the ruffle in the front and has layers on the bottom front of shirt. it doesn't seem to be defective, just a different version of the shirt. i'm curious to find out from others if they have gotten the same shirt as i have. still deciding whether to keep or not. no more left in xs to place another order and see what's up. i do wish it had the ruffle in front, as that is what caught my eye."
1,"Another greatcsweater So, i really like this sweater, as you'd expect for this price point, it's stylish in a very single way. so glad i read the review before mine to size down. the xs is great and i wouldn't want bigger. i love the length: how it goes long and cones in a little at the bottom, and the pockets are higher(i always need pockets for my phone). the stripes are well draped as the sweater transitions from shoulder to arm. the cuffs are fun, too. 
bottom line:  i'm really glad this came on sale and i snatc"
1,Feminine and pretty Beautiful top that will go with anything. looking forward to wearing it.
0,"No ruffle but cute I was very disappointed to receive this and to note that the blouse has no ruffle down the front as pictured. there is no ruffle anywhere on the blouse. i am likely still going to keep it because i like the pattern, but the ruffle was what interested me for a cute work blouse and i want other shoppers to know that the blouse actually includes no ruffle when you order it."
1," This caught my eye, purely by accident as i was in the dressing room. immediately attracted to the pattern, the color, the quality and the shape of the skirt. lo and behold, it turned out to be maeve, one of my favorite designers at retailer. this skirt does not disappoint at all. i normally try to wait for sales to make a purchase, but this is well worth the full retail price. the skirt is very well made. the material is structured but not stiff. i also don't normally like high waisted ski"
1,Best cardigan This is quite long on my 5'1 frame but it's wool and will be amazing in the fall and winter. so happy i finally ordered this
1,"Classic and feminine I bought this skirt in the store a few months ago, because i anticipated that retailer would sell out of my size considering how great the fit/look of this skirt is. sure enough, they've sold out of the size 2. normally i wear a size 4, sometimes 6, in skirts depending on the cut and where it's from; just last year i bought a skirt from retailer in a size 10! for me, this was a skirt i needed to try on to get the perfect size, but it's absolutely adorable and a great deal at the sale price! it's mod"
0,"I would keep it if it was not asymmetrical I wish there were be fewer asymmetrical tops in the store. i see many tops i like until i discover they have an asymmetrical hem and are longer in the back, which i do not prefer."
1,"It is versitle and sleek design. I personally like light garment and simple design for my daily dresses.  it meets my needs.
i personally recommend it to customers."
0,"Unflattering Even in my usual petite small size, this looked bulky and made me look stumpy. disappointing because the style looks so good in the picture and the material looks to be good quality. i don't even know if going down a size would have helped. as others have mentioned it looks like a frumpy house robe."
0,"Eh. There's just nothing special about it. it runs small and the fabric is itchy. the design with button caught my eye, but i didn't like it well enough to keep it."
1,Love pilcro Always love getting pilcro pants and these are just as good as previously purchased ones. i got the grey in 32 and i'm glad i did - i've ranged from a size 30-34 so i wasn't super sure which size would be be best.
1,"Almost perfect The cut and print of this dress is beautiful. however, the armhole is way too low, which is a reoccurring problem with anything sleeveless from retailer these days. please don't drop the armholes so low, most women do not want their bra completely showing every time you lift your arm!"
1,Love it Wish they had more colors avail in my size when i bought this one. you can easily dress it up or down.
1,Great top!! Bought the gray and peach in the store and loved it so much ordered the other colors online. this top is very comfortable and stylish. it stands out from the crowd as just enough different to be very unique and trendy but still a classic look. the sweater front is very soft and the back has a bit of a silk feel but not sheer. i also like that the back is a bit longer than the front.
1,"Tts but smaller than the pilcro high rises It's true to size but as an fyi for fellow pilcro high rise wearers, don't size down like you might with them. i had my regular and my high rise pilcro sizes and my regular size fit in these. the down side for these is they are clingy and a bit prone to a camel toe effect until they stretch out during the day"
1,"Not petite I ordered two colors of these in 25p.  i am keeping them because they feel wonderful on, but they definitely have to be hemmed! i measured the inseam on both pairs to be closer to 29 inches.  29 inches is not a petite length."
1,"Great cords Corduroy fabric is historically difficult to fit well....even with stretch added. so imagine my surprise when i tried on the pilcro serif mid-rise corduroy pants in the saffron yellow shade and they fit great! they were long enough as well. i loved them so much that i ordered the aqua shade as well and when that pair arrived, it fit just a nicely as the yellow ones. how wonderful that there is finally a corduroy pant that truly fits well. these are not old lady pants either...how nice!"
1," This sweater is so lovely, i bought it first in navy and then came back for it in grey. very soft and comfortable. the back doesn't wrinkle the way you might think it would from the pics alone. very flattering. i highly recommend it!"
0,"So sad! this year's pant is sooo much shorter! I ordered first the green, then the grey (in case the green was mismarked.)
so short!!
is this to be in keeping with the ankle pant trend??
anyone who wants a shorter pant could easily hem them. but there is no way to lengthen them.
i held the new pants up to an older pair from previous years. they are a full 2 1/2 inches shorter! wow!
note how in the photo of the golden color pants they barely skim the model's ankle. that's how they are in real life.
i wear these pants in a tall, and live"
1,"Fabric was itchy for me The blouse looked better on the model. i liked the way it fit, just not how it looks. the fabric made me itch, which was one of the other reasons i returned it. i wished it had looked good and the fabric didn't make me itch. i really liked the unique look to the shirt."
0,"More like a bathrobe Big pockets make it look more like a bathrobe than a coat. there are no internal pockets and the loops for the belt are pretty skimpy - just a bit of string. the color is great, but the quality leaves something to be desired."
1,"Midi dress I ordered this in large since it was the last one available. i normally wear a med, but i do enjoy the oversize look in silhouettes like this one. the armholes are very low, but since i have hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) this does not bother me one bit. i'll just wear a super lightweight tank underneath for coverage/protection. also, the oversize fit allows me to wear a long sleeve for layering if i desire. i love the flow and fluidity of the material and will be wearing this one a lot."
1,"Fantastic &  fun I saw this top online and fell in love with the overall casual look.
i ordered all 3 colors, and they just arrived........love love love !!!
they are soft, comfortable and a have a very flattering casual fit.
the understated ruffled details add the special ""something"" that is so retailer.
they are sophisticated yet pretty.
the orange is more vibrant in person and is a beautiful shade.
the plum/purple is a rich, unique and pretty color.
the navy is a perfect ""denim"" color.
a fantastic basic"
0," Very boxy top, not flattering on. i will be returning."
1,"Great peasant dress! Good dress to wear with heels, flats, tights. versatille!"
1,"The perfect skinny cord These got me so excited for fall. the teal is a color i'm really into right now and was the real reason i decided to order these. when they arrived though, i was delighted to find that they are light weight and have the perfect amount of stretch. the fit is snug, but hugs all the right places and are so comfortable! these will be a staple in my wardrobe. i want to order more colors!"
1,"Perfect cords! they do run short! I am in love with these. bought the regular length last year and loved them despite the shortness (hit right above the ankle). that length looks good with ballet flats or tucked into boots. this year i bought the burgundy and the teal in the long length. i am 5'7"" and the long fit perfectly! they come to the bottom of my ankle without extra fabric. 
please restock the ""carbon"" in the long length! i want to buy my 4th pair!"
1,Great pants I love these pants the only thing i would say is that they don't run small! i read reviews saying they are small in the waist so i ordered a size up and ended up regretting it. other then that i love them
1,"Great cords! At 6' tall, it's hard to find pants that fit my inseam (35"") and these fit the bill. i normally wear a 30 or 31 tall in pants (from brands like ag or paige), but i bought these in a 29 tall as i find pilcro tends to run large. they are soft and comfortable and don't stretch out 3 sizes by the end of the day, which is great. they feel like leggings! the wine color looks just like the images. for those who find measurements helpful, i'm 6' tall, 160lbs with about 42"" hips and a 35"" inseam."
1,"Love these pants! Bought my 3rd pair of pilcro cords in the dark turquoise. the other 2 are from previous seasons. love these pants for fall because they are extremely comfortable and stylish. the dark turquoise was paired with the poppy tunic (in blue) at my local store. i liked the pairing and ended up buying both! i find these to fit true to size vs other items at retailer that fit larger. i am a 29 (8) while in most other pants at retailer, i am a 6. i am 5'7 and 135 lbs."
1,"Perfect I love this dress, is perfect in every way. no complaints. very pretty colors. will wear it with a belt."
1,Softest pants These pants are so soft and comfortable!! the colors are great too. can't wait to buy more in other colors!
1,"Peplum top The picture is accurate. i got the plum version. the color and effect are really unique. the fit is tts. i wear an 8 in tops and the medium is fine. the sleeves are flattering-  belled but not ridiculous. the fabric is soft. if the body of the top was a little less wide it would be a 5 star item. with flare legs, i think it will balance out the volume of the cut."
1,Fabulous cords These tight cords are perfect for fall.
0," Unfortunately, does not look anything like in the picture. looks like an oversized house robe. i expected much more but was disappointed. i am definitely returning it."
1,"Nice top! I really like this top. it is made of cotton and linen blend, so the fabric is not as soft as i would have expected. however, it did not bother me at all, and i am really liking it.
the fabric is on a sheer side, so it is a bit see through. nothing too revealing, however it is a thin fabric.
overall, i am happy with this top!"
1,"Lots of stretch, nice 4 layering Although this isn't a soft top, i didn't find it that scratchy or bothersome at all. it's 55% linen! and, for linen it's soft. it's also got tons of stretch which makes it very comfortable as far as movement. 

i bought the black, and i do not find this sheer or see-thru. it's a light thickness which makes it perfect for layering under a jacket or sweater for a cool spring or warm fall day. i found it running tts, with the sleeves and length a little long (i'm petite) making perfect for the av"
0,"Seriously? I am a sucker for a peasant dress. i love anything i can toss with a pair flats and head out the door, but this dress is ridiculous. i look like a schoolmarm. the white bib collar takes this dress into costume territory. i love one september and have many items from the brand that i wear regularly, so i'm bummed that this wasn't what i expected. i knew it would have flow, but it's more billowy than i wanted. stay away unless you want to look like a little girl on the first day of school."
1,Fall cords More of a legging than a true pant. fits really well. grey color is great and will go with lots of things.
1,"A+++ I fell in love with this top in the store and ordered another online. it is very soft and comfortable. the petite tend to run a little short in the front, but the regular is perfect. it's oversized without being frumpy or boxy on my petite frame."
1," These cords are great, the fit, the style, everything! my new favorite fall pants!"
1,"Easy I first bought this top in the dark grey, loved it so much that i ordered the navy too! the quality is amazing as always, and fit is perfect (some may say it runs large, but i'm pretty sure it is meant to have a looser fit). i love the material of the lighter color blocked back. it's so versatile and easy to throw on. i've worn it simply with jeans, and i've also paired it with a pencil skirt and overlapping skinny belt and heels for a great work outfit (received compliments!)."
1,"Love this piece!!! This piece fits true to size and is very flattering on. sometimes i worry about my stomach not being perfectly flat, but this wasn't an issue at all, probably because of the intricate lace details. the fabric is substantial enough that i don't feel like it'll get a hole in it after multiple wears."
1,"Not for a 34g This tank is lovely: understated but well-made of nice fabric. i love viscose because it drapes nicely on my curves. but this is a swing shaped tank. shoulda known better. and it's cropped so... giant fabric tent hanging from the biggest part of me. if i put in big french darts, it'd be too too short. no way to make it work so it's going back. (p.s. i clicked ""true-to-size"" but what does that mean?? sizes vary from brand to brand, from decade to decade... i don't understand how anyone could thin"
1,"Pretty print! This print/color combination is really pretty. i think it's a little muted compared to the picture, but still very pretty. it is definitely longer than expected - i'm 5'-5"" and it almost touches the floor. will definitely need to wear with heels. colors will actually work in the fall with boots and in spring with heeled sandals. it actually has a shorter underskirt, so there's no accidental show. i really like the dark blue wrap #extra fabric at top# - sits below the waist and will help hide imp"
1,"Lovely summer into fall top! Such an adorable top. very flattering despite it's rather full style. just be sure you get the correct size since it does indeed run quite large. i normally wear a small, sometimes medium. i ordered both sizes to be sure but they were both too large! i sized down to xs and that fit perfectly."
1,"Gorgeous, unique top I purchased this top in the store, intending only to go in and return two tops i purchased on sale that did not fit. i had been looking for a red top to wear with navy, and this one couldn't have looked more perfect on the hanger. from the front, it looks pretty traditional, but the back is just gorgeous! the multi-colors and the pleating give the top a lot of interest and depth. the fabric is also super soft and comfortable. the top does run quite large, though, as i purchased an xs and still h"
1,Long and wonderful I am six feet tall and this sweater is a perfect fit for tunic length over skinny jeans. if you are shorter i assume it would be longer. i bought the green color which is a beautiful dark hunter green. the bodice is fitted and doesn't show any bra straps and the bottom is slightly loose and forgiving . love this sweater!
1,"I never write reviews, but... This dress is amazing! the fit, style, quality of fabric is just perfect. just the right amount of ""v"" in the front and back to be flattering and sexy without being too exposed! will be looking for more styles from this designer!"
1,"Dressy or casual I love this top!! it is flattering in all the right places. i struggle with shirts the are too flowy however this is forgiving yet looks more fitted and flattering. i bought the shirt in blue and am buying it now in red! i typically buy a large or xl, in this shirt a large is perfect!"
1,"Beautiful print, so comfy! Love these - the colors are perfect for fall. originally ordered a small which fit fine (i'm a 6-8) but felt the black color would look better if i sized up and the material wasn't as stretched - i'm glad i exchanged for a medium for that reason."
1,"Gorgeous dress I am truly heartbroken that this dress is sold out in my size -- it's is incredibly flattering, glamorous, and interesting. and it has sleeves! this is such a hard combo to find and i wish more than anything i can find my size to wear to a wedding. retailer, please please make more dresses like this one that flatter all figures and are classics."
1,"Gorgeous! I saw this dress online and i ordered immediately!
it has everything i love: my fav color, a peplum and feminine cut out details.
i ordered my usual size medium, and it was too tight in the chest, and i am just average... 34c.
loved it so reordered in a size large.
if you are thinking of purchasing this beauty i would suggest going up a size if you are on the upper end
of your size (medium 8/10 and i am usually a 10 so needed to go up)
the reason i gave the quality a lower rating is that the med"
1,"So beautifully done... This is a lovely, well-fitting, embroidered, navy tank, i cannot find a flaw in this. i am 5'5, 142 lbs., 34d and the size 6 is a fantastic fit. one of those tops that is so well-cut that it feels as if one is wearing nothing. the lining is impeccably done and is cut perfectly for the blouse. it has a small cut-out in the back at the v. it fits just as the photo shows and is so versatile-it can be worn with everything from jeans to a formal skirt. six stars!"
1,So comfortable This is such a cute top. it runs large...i bought an xs and usually wear a small or medium. it's flowy and comfy. looks great with dark jeans.
0,"Love style, not quality The color of this top is lovely. however, i felt the quality was lacking for the price. the fabric is thin and the top i tried on in the store had some loose threads already. fit was tts for me."
1,"A head turner! Bought this dress for my daughter to wear to a rehearsal dinner and i couldn't believe how beautifully it fit. fitted through the top, falling to a gorgeous flare. hit her at knee (she's 5""6'). classic, elegant, femme fatale look that will work for a range of occasions."
1,Party in the back I saw this top on a store mannikin and was drawn to it by it's color and print. it looked great with blue jeans on display and a lariat necklace. then i noticed the different design on the back below the yoke. the surprise was its being pleated into very fine pleats. i liked the funky quality this added. the design is a good transitional piece to wear early fall or under a jacket. it is machine washable and that finalized the purchase of it. i bought the necklace too. i often wear a small but go
1, Adorable with black pants or jeans. covers the part of your arm you might want covered :-)
1," The fabric is incredibly soft and has a good weight to it. this is also pretty warm. it's not a down jacket, but it's as least as warm as a sweatshirt. it fits close to the body in typical bomber jacket fashion. i'm 5'6 155 lbs and went with the large, which fits well. i always find myself wishing bomber jackets were just a tad longer and this is no exception, but i can't really fault the jacket for that, it's true to the style."
0,Weird arm holes The arm holes are just weird .. a little too big for me was just 'off'... back it goes.
0,"Ripped after one wear I have purchased many dresses from retailer for weddings and events.  this is the first time i have been disappointed with the quality.  however, the sleeve on this dress ripped after lifting up my toddler son in the middle of a wedding.  the size 4 seemed to fit perfectly, but the fabric had no give.  it was not overly tight in the bust as i am bra size 34aa.  for the price, i expected better.  the color and style of the dress is gorgeous, so perhaps ordering one size up is the answer. . ."
0,"Lumpy on the sides Usually wear s and xs, tried this in s at store but the sides were still lumpy after zipping the size zipper up. if i tried xs it would have looked better but may be bit too tight. the sides of the arm holes were also cut very low. it also has a dusty grey sheen to it that makes it look like old velvet in a bad way. two layers, green on outside, and a polyester beige layer underneath.

but definitely a showpiece that can be paired with a short jacket."
1,"Comfy sweatshirt! This sweatshirt is really nice!  it's oversized so best worn with leggings or skinny jeans. it's very warm, without being too thick. it looks almost exactly like the picture.   the quality seems pretty good, but we'll see how it holds up after it's washed."
1,"Love these pin stripe chinos I am in love with the pilcro brand. this pair is gorgeous. i love the how versatile these will be in my wardrobe. i can dress them up with a nice blazer, sweater or dress them down with t-shirts or tanks. these will be a staple in my wardrobe. they are a nice navy blue."
1, Very cute top! even prettier in person! i ordered it by mistake but i am definitely keeping it! the regular xs size fits perfectly (i was concerned about my twin sisters!)
0,Beautiful silk dress A beautiful silk dress - light and cute but not worth the price. this dress is extremely thin and no lined at all. it's very light and i'm afraid would be completely see through.
1,"Beautiful dress - sleeve problems This dress is stunning.  it is a great classic, that i wished had worked out for me.  i went through 3 different dresses, and each time, the cap sleeve would tear.  there is not much room, if at any for arm movement without the fabric tearing.  i am so disappointed.  it wasn' even tearing on a seam (so there was no way to repair it).  if you do not intent to dance in this dress and are wearing it for a low key night or dinner, it would most likely work....it is not for a wedding with dancing!"
1,"Great bomber for cool, not freezing, weather This bomber does have a partial double layer with 2 zippers, one for the partial inner sweatshirt, and another for the jacket itself. the material is soft and cozy and the color is exactly what i was looking for, true to the picture. i find it very good for colder west coast nights, and the hood is cute, but not as functional in rain since it's made out of sweatshirt material. i am a curvier size l to xl and the large fit me very well and gives a nice shape zipped."
1,"Beautiful and simple dress I bought this dress for my bridesmaids and it fit all 6 different body types wonderfully! it is a very classic look. the material is very nice, a little heavier and more formal."
1,"Best pick for the fall ! Super cute blouse- great with a jean jacket, - sleeved or sleeveless. pleating is neat and a nice unique detail, without getting to full. usually a 4 or small in blouses, bought the xs. made this decision based on the arm hole openings, seemed a little large and set low on the small. ."
0,"Only looks good in photos Dress was a disappoint. very thin and cheaply made, not worth the money at all. pictures make it look much better than in real life. top area is also made small so if you are busty, this is not the dress for you."
1,"Nice but large I love this top. the design is very good, i love the pleats at the back, and i tried both colors. i prefer blue even though both look good. the fit is very loose mainly due to the pleats at the back. i usually wear xl but bought this in an l, which was also very loose. i think an m would be too tight across the shoulders but loose lower because of the pleats. i am keeping the blue because i like this style, with fitted pants it would work well."
1,Lovely tank for fall This tank caught my eye in the store yesterday. i was taken by the design contrast of the front and back. the colors are beautiful and rich. i see this as the perfect tank to transition into the fall season. the top does run a little big. i sized down to a medium. i am just under 5'5 and am a 36g.
1,Totally cute and unique Saw this hanging in the store. it is cute front and back.  it is flattering as well. i plan to wear under a jacket for work and without a jacket at night.  looks amazing with a denim jacket
1,"Favorite new top I love this top!!! i usually wear a medium but all that was left were larges, so i figured i'd take a chance. it is gorgeous, and not too big! the quality is fabulous, and the color is very soft and complimentary. i am so glad i ordered this. can't wait to wear it!!!"
0,"Pretty but not enough for the price I don't have a lot of pink or lavender in my wardrobe, but any time i do try a shade like this on i always think it compliments my skin tone and hair color. i generally wear a mauve-ish or coppery eye shadow and the color of this shirt looks beautiful against that makeup too. unfortunately, i just don't find the shape of the top to be flattering. it's really long, so the way the model has it partially tucked looks best but i'm not really thin like her and i have a larger chest... it just doesn't"
1,"Cool beach pants I was looking for the full legged pants with a slit, light enough for the beach. they have my size finally! i'm a regular 12 and m worked well for me. can't wait to wear these with a nice top."
1,Cute tank I love this style of tank top with the wider straps. very flattering but yes the armholes are big and i noticed the sizing is different with each color. i normally wear an xs but in the gray and blue i bought s to have a little room. i also bought the black color but the s was huge! i exchanged for an xs so hopefully it will fit better. it had to be ordered. it definitely stretches out as you wear it though.
0,"Not sure I purchased this to wear on the same day. it did have a strong smell ! i tried airing but didn't help much so didn't wear. tags are cut so will probably give a try after washing (by hand, my fault for not checking this part). it is a bit over my price range for a casual top, so hoping i'll end up loving it!"
0,"Petite frames will love this! The shirt is beautiful, but fits much too small. the stitching limits the space in your shoulders, and the hem too short. a petite frame would be able to pull this off- but i am a 5.10"" medium, and the shirt didn't work in every direction."
1," Cute top, good color, fabric is a little rough and scratchy"
1,"Love!! I'm in love with these tanks. so in love that i bought four of them (black, grey, blue, and the black motif). they are so flattering on. i love the low scoop neck and the wide straps. the cut is interesting enough to wear the shirt on its own, but also perfect for under a cardigan. i purchased a nearly identical one from retailer (which was made by velvet) several months ago and it was much more pricey. these are a much more affordable option."
0,"Not for curves This top is very pretty on the hanger. however, i have a curvy bust, and it was incredibly unflattering on my body. boxy, too high of a neckline, unattractive. the plus sides to it are that crochet detailing is lovely, and the color is nice as well. maybe if you have a 1920's frame it would work."
0," I love the wide straps but it runs small and is short. still great for layering. great, soft material. i hate that it is so tight and short but if i size up them the arm holes would be way too big."
1,"Surpassed expectations ! Wow! this skirt blew me away out of the package! i almost had to wonder if i received the right skirt i had ordered! i thought the skirt was mostly an oatmeal isth color , but irl the skirt is predominantly purple with real and beige colors weaved in! the skirt itself is also a fine sweater knit which makes it look more luxurious! i'm thinking this skirt will look awesome in the fall, but might be a bit heavy for some in the summer weather. the skirt is also longer than expected... i'm 5'6"" and"
1,"Summer love I wish it was a little bigger.i kept this,for it will be wonderful for summer."
1,Fun top...pretty color...pinkish lavender I ordered this cutie before i read any reviews and i am so glad i did. mine does not have any weird smell at all. i ordered a medium and i wear a size 8. it fits perfectly and is long enough to wear with leggings ...with coverage. the detailing on the yoke is so pretty. i bought it with a discount promotion so it made the price better. i am really glad to add it to my wardrobe!!
1," This tank top runs big. i?m usually a xs and i ordered the xs and pxs due to reviews and the pxs is still big. i kept the pxs because it?s very cute and i love the color (ordered the canton). i?ve been taping the tank to my bra so it does not slip too far down. however, not sure if i will order this again."
1,"Ok for the price I ordered the black (not yet available ) through my store, as the xs was too big, and we tried ordering xs petite but it was not yet available. so we ordered xxs. (i am 115lbs). it fits nicely, but - as mentioned in previous review - it is thin. not see through in black, but thin. cut is nice though, i still think petite would fit me better i n length, but xxs was good... got a think if i will keep or not as htis is a nice summer basic..."
1,White tank I bought the white tank and the small fits me but it's very low cut for me. the white is sheer as well. i usually wear an xs or a small and i would be curious to see what the xs would fit like in the sense of how low cut it is.
1,Perfect romper I always look at jumpsuits but they never seem to work for me because of my height (5'1) and petite stature. i ordered the xxsp and it fits perfectly! so comfortable and made of high quality silk which you can really feel is well made. love that there is no zipper- just a hidden elastic tube top and a hook and eye below the nape of the neck. plan on wearing this for my 30th birthday with heels or booties and a cropped leather jacket!
1,"Great dress This dress is adorable and professional at the same time. i was worried that the print would overpower me but it's a nice fabric. i'm 5'2"" and the petite small is perfect. i don't like to wear form fitting clothing for work and this fits right for me. plus it's hand washable. i haven't worn or washed it yet but i'll easily wear it to my ""creative professional"" workplace."
1,"Lovely top I was in the store looking specifically for long sleeved tops that are cute and found this! pretty color pinky purple and my usual xs is perfect. i'm 5'6"", 127 lbs, 34b. love this--definitely unique and feminine. and--no--nary a smell in the mix!"
0,"Strange cut, pretty idea I bought this in size xl and it ran small along the waist & bottom hemline. i'm pear-shaped so it's an awkward fit. i'll wear it tucked in or belted. they used a lot of material in the sleeves & through the top portion. i wish they hadn't made it such a narrow cut along the bottom.

the sleeves are very pretty. the embroidery they used for the cutouts is a little rough & scratchy. since i got it on sale & like the color, i'm keeping it. i recommend trying this on if you can."
1,"Beautiful blouse This is a beautiful lightweight sheer blouse. the front has a liner and the arms and back are sheer. i usually wear a s or xs - the xs was plenty roomy. i'll wear a cami due to the sheerness of the back .the cutouts in the long sleeves are quite pretty. overall this is a classy blouse that can be worn with any number of jeans, slacks or skirts. thanks retailer!"
1,"Hit or miss I tried this in the black and white in the store. the material is very thin. you cannot wear the white without a cami which defeats the purpose of wearing this tank in the summery. the arm holes are cut very inconsistently. some are very big which creates a very unflattering gap under the armpit. others are cut fine. i tried on 3 different smalls in the black and found one that was cut just right. this does fit snuggly, but is more flattering that way."
1,"Please bring back more!!! Love this tank! prettier shade of yellow in person. love the strap width and length. wish they'd bring back more in lots of colors. i sized up one from my usual size and will have to shorten the length of the strap myself, but it's an easy alteration and is totally worth it! especially good at sale price. i really hope they make more in the style in lots of colors. great find!"
1,"Love the detail! I bought this top in my usual size large and it is slightly big, but not so much that i would want to size down.  the material is slightly itchy, but i think that it's worth it because it's such a pretty top. i absolutely love the detail at the top.  it is beautiful!  if you wear a nude bra, you can't see the strap lines through the material.  i also love the coloring of this top.  this is a great top that i can see myself wearing with dress pants for work or with jeans for a more casual look."
0,"Nope I'd been waiting to snatch up this jumpsuit as it looks so cute online, so when it went on sale i ordered it right away. well i was thoroughly disappointed. i agree with some of the other reviewers, the fit is odd, huge on top and too snug on the bottom. being made of flimsy silk it has no give and didn't hang well on my curvy body, being too loose in some areas and too snug in others. also the top is embroidered while the bottom isn't. the material is thin and and it definitely isn't high enoug"
1,Perfect for hot summer nights! The picture doesn't do these justice! they are beautiful and a must-have for summer date nights. i am 5'2 and hover between 115-120. i tried on the regular size in-store and they were way too long. so i ordered the xs petite and they fit perfectly! i like to pair them with a flowy top that hangs over the waist band. (not styled like the pic). they literally feel like you are wearing nothing. you'll receive so many compliments - trust me!
1,"Awesome basic tee I bought a similar tee by velvet by graham and spencer a couple years ago and have been searching for another one ever since. the wide straps are flattering on me because of my broad shoulders. i love the price too, very reasonable. i want one in every color."
1,Great fit I bought the fuschia colored tank to wear under a sweater for the fall. great color. fits well.
1,Awesome tank or layering piece! I really like this top. perfect underneath cardigans or on its own. the fabric is a bit thin so light colors may be see through. love the wider style so there is no bra show. versatile. i see myself purchasing more of these!
0,"Pretty, but extremely thin This item is pretty, the print on the fabric is nice and reminiscent of embroidery, but only the top portion has a few embroidered accents. my issue with it is it's very impractical. the fabric is extremely thin, and you wouldn't want to wear it in any weather below 75 degrees. it's ridiculous to advertise this product for a fall/winter season. the tube top underneath doesn't work very hard to stay up, and isn't a very practical way to hold up the jumpsuit (why wouldnt they just stitch a lining"
1,"Gorgeous maxi dress This dress is absolutely stunning! the colors are vibrant and it flows very nicely touching the floor. 
 it runs very small, i ordered size medium and i could not even zip the dress, i normally wear size 10. i had to return it and order again in size large. i love the fit this time!! but be aware if your normal size is higher than 10 this dress will not fit and larger sizes are not available for this dress. it is nice addition to my wardrobe and i am planning to wear it to the multiple occasion"
1,"Could be great I have bought 4 of these, but after 1st wash on 2 of them and they were in a lingere bag, there are little holes on the front of each, now they are bum around shirts. if they go on sale i will purchase, but the material needs to be better."
0, Very sheer inexpensive material. even on sale i'm returning it
1, Great tank top! loved it so much that i ordered 3!
1," The color was a little darker than it looks online, but i like it!"
1,"Beautiful but small I made the mistake of ordering a medium instead of large and have the same fit issues as other reviewers. it is tight in the back through the shoulders, so if you're considering it i would stick with your larger of your size range. the print is beautiful as is the fabric. it looked okay on me from the side but i am short waisted. it fell at the perfect length on me too. there's just something about the fit that didn't wow me so i don't plan to reorder, but i do think it would be lovely on thinne"
1,"Nice tank Like the look of this tank, ran a bit larger than expected at the neck but overall happy with the purchase"
0,"Chemical smell This shirt smelled so bad when i received it (and i am not at all sensitive to smells). is it from the dye? 
i tried it on anyway. it is shapeless and nothing special. at almost 80 bucks it is so over priced."
1,"Pretty top!!!! Lovely top with details and a unique color. i have read some other reviews and i honestly don't know why it is getting bad reviews. it is linen but not scratchy by any means, like linen it does give with wear, so i recommend sizing down as it does run a little large. with a nude bra you won't see your straps and i would dryel this, no washing of any kind, linen shrinks! overall great top and i was glad i snatched one up."
0,"My recommendation is a ""maybe"" This top is for someone flat chested and skinny. i really like the styling, color, fabric and everything except that it's not for my body type. i am a 36dd and have a little bit of a stomach... so it makes me look fat from the sides.
the pictures taken on the model are from the front and back - but i will bet she would still look good in it from the sides! will be returning it."
1,"Great spin on a basic tank This is a super flattering, cute tank! i've purchased it in several colors because it's such a great fit. somewhat thin material and slightly sheer (especially the white). i like that it has good coverage on the sleeves so that bra straps nor 'side boob/armpit' fat shows. looks great with pilcro capris for a cute, casual summer look! i wish they would come out with even more colors!"
0,"Dye stains everything! The turqoise color is pretty, however, it did smell bad out of the package. i wore it once and it transferred the dye to my skin and white pants, bra and cami! hope it all comes out in the wash. i tried to hand wash the shirt and now have blue hands and a blue tub."
0,"Unflattering fit This is a rare review for me, i usually love my retailer purchases, even at times when other reviewers aren't fans, but this top is terrible. 5'4"" 103, 32 b for reference, small frame, athletic, bought the xs in black. the length could have been longer, but i could have lived with the length. the arm hole area, however, a different story. because it's boxy, and the fabric is stiffer bc of the large flowers, the top sticks out on the sides under the arm holes leaving a gape, it did not fit snuggly"
1,"Great basic tank The wide strap style is very flattering. this tank is fitted in my normal size small, it fits like the model in the cobalt blue color. i'm 5'7"" 120lbs. if you want more room, i'd size up. it is low cut, but not inappropriately so. fits like the picture shows."
1,"Heavenly Looks just like it does on the model. i am 5'130lbs and the ps fits perfectly. i wore mine with a t and wedges. adorable and more importantly, comfortable! flows nicely without being distracting. got lots of compliments."
1,"Prefect little tank Great soft basic. low scoop neck makes this tank flirty while the thicker strap keeps it modest. i absolutely love this top, easily dress up and down!"
1,"Perfect spring skirt Knitted midi skirts are part of my daily uniform so i was drawn to this one. its high quality showcases intricate details: the pattern on the front is different from that on the back, the hem is asymmetric and is reverse high-low, the flat waist means the skirt is not too voluminous. the colors and pattern are reminiscent of missoni. it should be easy to coordinate with solid tops. wonderful quality and machine washable. i'm 5'5"" and the petite medium fits me as pictured. since i want the back t"
0,"Cute styling but... This shirt had an overpowering vinegar odor when i took it out of the packaging.

the mint green color was appealing but the styling did not look good and the smell was too much."
1,"Good basic but runs a bi big I love this tee, and am a picky tee person. it runs big, the striped colors are even bigger but i washed in warm and dried them and they are great. super soft and sexy for a tee! i bought the xxs and i am 115 lbs and 5'2"". i like the longer length -- cute with leggings. not 5 stars due to stretched out arm holes."
1,"So cute, runs large!!! Love the material, pockets, length (i wear petitie - i'm 5'3) etc. i usually wear a medium, but this dress runs incredibly large. i was drowning in it and sadly had to return it. size one or two sizes down if you want to purchase!!"
1, Awesome basic top for your wardrobe. it's a little sheer but not too much.
1,Sexiest t eva!!! I love this tank! basic but super sexy! i'm an a cub and this tee makes them look a lil bigger so i'll take it!! i bought the dark grey in small and went back for the striped grey and purchased small. i bought the black one too but i feel like the small in black is too big and the xsmall is too small. i'm torn because i want the black to tuck in a pencil skirt.
1,"Nice surprise I took a risk on this one. i wasn't sure if the shirt was more green or more blue. i look better in blue. it turns out that the shirt is a bit more green, but i think it still looks good! i'm 5'3' and 125 lbs. i got a medium. i could have maybe gotten a small, but i like the medium. the shirt has a bit of a vintage look to it, which i like. all in all good."
1,"Stunning but small This dress is stunning. i loved the cut and seam detailing. it is very flattering...if it fits. i have a curvy athletic build and usually wear a size 10/12. i am also smaller busted and this dress was too tight around my ribs, back and tummy. i bought the large and it doesn't' come in a bigger size :( it is very well made and completely lines. i highly recommend this dress but again only it if fits you."
0,"Lovely color Lovely color and sweet top, but the fabric was so itchy i couldn't wear it."
1,"Sheer but great fit I wish there were 100 colors, i'd buy them all. the white is super sheer, but i'll use it as a bottom layer for something."
0,"Runs large...until you wash it I bought 3 shirts in gold, black and red. they arrived larger than expected. after the first wash and air dry they shrunk. i would have been thrilled but they shrunk to be shorter while staying too wide. also my black shirt faded a lot with one wash."
1,"Comfy and cute Love this shirt, it's so comfy for fall/ winter, but has the really cute detail at the top. love the color too!"
1,"Great tank, love the wider straps I saw the tank at the store and was so glad to try it on. i got the small?i'm in between xs and s (34b) and try to get petites when i can but the small fit great with a longer cut. i bought the green and did not find it sheer. i actually thought it was thicker than most tanks and tees these days. i found the arm holes were fine. i usually need to go with a petite just for this reason but no need to this time. planning on getting a couple of more colors!"
1,"Great comfy skirt First of all, the photo online doesn't really do the colors of this skirt justice. it is a heathered knit, with colors of white, gold (deep yellow), raspberry (or almost maroon), and teal. i have never seen a color combo like this before, and its really fun. i am wearing it today with a burgundy color sweater, but i anticipate being able to match it for summer with any of those colors i just mentioned, or even navy or tan. the skirt has a lining in it, and the wide ribbed knit runs at varying an"
1,"Fun tshirt design Actually you would think just another tshirt but actually with the wide straps it changes it up enough to really be cute.  i like the look it adds.  i really want to get more colors.   i normally wear everything from retailer in small , and even though this fit it was small for a small.  i will keep it but i think i will buy others in medium."
1,Love this simple tank! I tried this on in-store in white and in grey. it is so super comfy and really cute. i love the wide straps! i ended up getting it in white and black. the grey looked a tad bit more casual than the white and black tanks.
1,"Gorgeous This gorgeous dress really does bloom before your eyes. the silk is light, airy and very delicate. the bodice runs large and the length runs long (i have to wear my highest platforms) but i would not return because it's an exquisite piece of art."
1,Love this shirt This is a great fall shirt. great for dressing up casual wear!!!
1,"Wide-strap tank The size s arm holes are a little too over-sized and i find i keep adjusting the shoulders so the sides of my bra won't show (and sizing down to an xs made the body too tight). it's a bit pricey for a basic, thin tank, but it's a good every day, wear all the time staple."
1,"Beautiful color! I bough the blue color and love it. the neckline detail is fun and make you take a double take when looking at what is otherwise a relatively simple top. it drapes nicely, and paired nicely with dark skinny jeans and ballet flats for work (i'm at a tech company, so casual to business casual). the ombre color is gorgeous! (the lavender is pretty too but seemed to wash me out and not fall as nicely).
regarding what other reviewers said: yes, it has a slightly vinegar smell when it came shipped, b"
1," I ordered the red motif in size m based on reviews this top runs small and it is too big. i'm 5'7""/ 34c /132 lbs and usually a size s in this brand. this top was large through the body and the arm openings were huge. i washed it and dried it but it still fits a bit large, it did wash up well though, no pilling."
1,"Perfect cut, very thin Love love love the cut of this tank top. it's is super thin and see thru however. wish it was made a bit thicker. i got it in white and you can see right thru it. however the cut is so fabulous i can over look that."
1,"Great skirt! Just purchased this skirt. it is absolutely the most comfortable skirt for every season......every color imaginable will go with this skirt. great with denim shirt too. lightweight cotton knit makes the skirt comfy with any temperature. waistband is wide and slimming to the tummy. i stand 5 foot 10 inches, 174 lbs and it is perfect in length. platform or flats, dress up or down. my favorite is a v neck tee with a couple necklaces and your good to go......"
1,"Special tee There's something special about this tank that makes it uber-flattering. the fabric is perfect, the colors (green and fuchsia) are spot-on gorgeous and brightening, and the cut (length, wide straps, and scooped neckline) make this the perfect staple. it flattered my figure, skin color, and really hid my flaws. i wish i could get away with wearing this every day..."
1,"Great summer top! I purchased the turquoise in a petite- xs. normally items at retailer run on the larger side and this shirt fit just right (i am 4ft 11inches and 100lbs). the material was a little on the lite side which makes a great summer fit, but it is a bit weak (so it can tear easily). it looks great with all types of skirts and jeans. i just wish retailer would sell more of the petite sizes. i went back in to buy more in other colors and they are sold out already!"
0,"Not worth the price Fits large, wrinkles easily and not what i expected for the price."
1,Very cute top! It definitely smells like vinegar but it went away after a few hours. i don't think its itchy. its kind of baggy and kind of has an ombr茫漏 look to it fading down to darker. it looks casual in the pic but i can wear it out at night with cute earrings
0,Color transferred to my skin This is a cute top but i wore it for around 5 hours and lo and behold i had smurf skin. i did not sweat in it but the color transferred to my underarm area and bra and it did not come off in the shower!! i guess it's going to have to wear off. thank goodness it was not a hot day!! i hope that i can return it.
0,"Cute but too long I like this top but unfortunately i will be returning. it's way too long. the color is pretty as is the design minus the length. it makes it look frumpy. maybe if they offered it in petite or if you're taller, it would work for you."
1,"Work-appropriate and classy This is a very flattering pencil skirt. i found it in the store and bought an xs, and have been wearing it to work. it is not too short, and the wrap fit looks great."
1,"Fall luxury Its a pleasure to wear this sweater! it feels like you are wearing a hug! it's that cozy! yet, it's almost weightless, which is nice for me because i get overheated easily. the only slight downfall is that it is dry clean only. i got this in charcoal but both color options are so pretty and you will be pleased how dressed up and flattering they look without giving up comfort!"
1," Super soft and comfy, with stylish look"
0,"Super huge top I have to return this top. the armholes are huge. the material is on the thin side and not what i expected. i can't size down. i got an xxs. maybe if i had been able to order a petite, it would have fit better. i ordered the red and i liked the color."
0,"Sad but true I too will be returning this sweater. love the style, shape and fabric, but after one wearing it has pilled terribly and now looks old and cheap."
1,"Warm wool Thank goodness i packed this on a recent trip to adirondacks because it kept me warm in the cool mountain weather. i love gray so i was drawn to this open stitch sweater. it is a boxy bulky look but a great layering piece. most bulk is in front, so it can camouflage areas. i wore this over a gray and black flannel plaid shirt. perfect!"
1,"Nice fit I was surprised at how much i liked this sweater. i was watching it for awhile and when it went on sale i decided to give it a try. i couldn't decided on the rose or black so i ordered both since they were such a good price, figuring i would return the color i didn't want. boy was i happy i ordered both. the rose is very flattering and the fit is so much better than i expected. i am 5'9' and usually take a large in size. i could have gone down one size, but the front drapes against your body it"
1,Special pattern unique design Runs a bit tight around upper arms. love the collar.
1,"Not for me... This vest is a really cute idea for layering, so i ordered my usual size medium. and while it fit, it just added about 5-10 pounds onto my frame! ehhh the front just has this extra fabric that you are supposed to bunch up and then tie down, but it just made me look so bulky! sizing down wouldn't have helped as the back would have been squeezed in a small. it's a shame because it seems pretty well made and comfortable too. i'm 5'6"", 140, and usually wear a 6 or 8."
1,"Easy, beautiful and different I stumbled upon the blue version in the store. i immediately liked that it was easy, chic, and just different-enough. after wearing it for a birthday dinner, i saw it online and realized that i had styled it almost exactly the same way the blue one is shown. black sandal wedges, silver cuff, silver earrings. it is flattering in an unexpected way, which may be partially because i am really small-chested. the front v is deep compared to what i usually wear, but double-sided tape easily kept my bra"
1,"Pretty but not perfect This is a thick jacquard fabric and the colors are stunning. this would be best for very thin petties or tall women. i'm 5'4"", 125#, 27/4, and it was just too much fabric so my waist looked thick. the length was great though. sad it didn't work out"
1,"Jury out for pilling (from previous commets) I saw the xxs petite in green in my store, adn decided to try this on only becasue it was a petite and in the store. i don't see green as an option nline anymore, so it must have been a old return... it is extremely soft, as others mentioned, and the fit is really flaterring. i bought it then read abou the rebviews, so will see... the fact that i bought the xxs, means it must run big!"
1,Pretty colors more for fall though This was returned in store in an xs. i tried it on and it fit. shorter so it was probably meant to be a mini. i will hold on to it for now. on sale so worth the price. colors are nice and bright
1,"Amazing quality, beautiful design I absolutely loved this the minute i saw it. the quality is impeccable, and the fit is amazing. i will agree with the other reviewer in that the fabric is very thick (back to the quality of this piece, amazing!!) and some women may not like the extra ""bulk"" to that part of the body. however i'm still on the hunt now for the perfect white top to go with it. thank you retailer for always providing unique, quality pieces :)"
1,"Get this now! This dress may not be worth the full price of $138 but on sale it is one huge bargain! so easy to wear and so incredibly flattering! seriously, i don't know why it's not sold out at this price! it hides all flaws without looking oversized or bulky. i totally disagree with the reviewer who called this dress ""sack"" like. found this tts. looks great with pumps or flats."
1,"Adorable but overpriced The print of this dress is what enticed me, and it did not disappoint. the fabric is a nice shade of medium grey with cream printing. however, the fabric is very thin. thankfully the top part is lined, but the bottom is not and it should be. this lightweight dress great for hot summer days, but for the price it really should be lined on the bottom as well. 
the dress is more a-line than pictured, which i liked. the bust is fitted and there is elastic in back. the skirt is fairly loose and flare"
1,Way better in person I was not expecting to like this. i tried it on in the store on a whim. it happened to drape beautifully. this will be a great work dress for the summer with something underneath the bring up the neckline. the blue color is soft and pretty.
1,"So in love I have been looking for a long jacket with personality for a while now. i got one from retailer 5 years ago and i've been looking for something just as great. walked into the store and fell absolutely in love. the fit is true to size, i prefer my jackets pretty fitted. the color seemed a bit rosey in the store, but now that i'm home seems more tan and brown. it's not going to be super warm, perfect for fall in colorado and warmer winter days. it's soft, so soft, not bulky at all. if this is your s"
1,"Perf for casual outing I saw this shirt in store a while ago, but could not believe the price and was not about to spend my money on it. however, when it went on sale and there was an extra 40%, i decided to get it. i like the top, it's cute and fun. however, it does poof out a little in the midline. this top goes great with jeans or shorts, and it is cute, but definitely not worth full price for this."
0,"Sack dress Unfortunately, this dress is shaped like a sack and has no shape to speak of. i have sent it back for a refund :( too big, too shapeless."
1,"Very pretty This top is very pretty. it's a bit more voluminous than the picture would let on, but otherwise as expected. you can adjust the ties at the shoulder."
0," Love the silhouette and coziness of the fabric. for the first few wearings, i was in love. then it began to pill horribly . . . would not recommend. my mother said, ""that's going to pill up."" and i ignored her. and she was right."
1,"Stunning This is stunning. it's almost snug for a 2 (i'm 5'6, 123 lb) but that might be because it's strapless. it's constructed with a bra inside so you can get away without wearing one. i can't wait to wear this and i'm going to have to find an event good enough to deserve this dress. i feel like audrey hepburn in this."
1,"Basic top with frills! The pattern attracted me to this top in store and when i tried it on, i was pleasantly surprised it has a slight swing shape to it which i love. i'm a 36c/d and normally wear an 8 or 10 and bought this in a large. the front buttons don't peek open and actually lays flat which is unusual for me with button up tops. i'm actually wearing it today with some printed green shorts. the stripes on this top make it easy to mix patterns, too :)"
1,"So cute in person! The material of this swimsuit is amazing. the swimsuit is expensive, but it is high quality in person. definitely one i'd recommend buying!"
1,"Sexy and comfy This robe is exactly what i was looking for.  it's perfect for lounging around while getting ready and also good for post-shower while i'm still drying off.  it is a little shorter than it looks on the model, but that's fine for me.  only downside is that it has to be hand washed."
1,"Love it I bought the deep maroon which is beautiful. absolutely love the softness, length and the casual look. you can dress it up and dress it down. it does run big. i got the medium but could wear the small easily enough. since i am 6 feet tall, i wanted to length to be where it is. the only part i did not like is the 3/4 length sleeves as it is tough when wearing a jacket over it."
0,Not recommended for girls with curves The fabric is soooo thick. the pattern is very spring/summer but the heavy thick and lined fabric says otherwise. the pockets are great and the fit was true to size but that fabric killed it for me
1,So soft! Love this sweater! i have it in the raspberry and the charcoal color. it's so soft and comfortable. looks great with jeans or leggings. it's casual but you can dress it up a bit and you still looked polished. it's a little oversized. only downfall is that it piles easily.
1,"Cute top I think this shirt is so cute. it is well-made. it's a flattering fit, and it's unusual. it still is a neutral though so you can wear it with lots of things. i'm really happy i bought it."
0,"Pull over sweater Looks beautiful in the photo and the color in person is beautiful but it runs so so large that i think even an extra small would be too large for me. just for comparison, and i wish all reviewers would include this, i am 5'5"" and weigh 120 pounds. i ordered a medium which a small to medium is my usual size but i ordered the medium because i wanted to have room to wear something under it. i could have worn two sweatshirts under this sweater. unfortunately i have returned it."
1,"Very pretty--runs very long though! This is long--as it is shown in the picture. i am five 8, and it's actually too long for me. it looks a bit matronly on as it's just so long. i loved the fabric--it's not heavy and it's super soft. i think it runs one size big. it's made very well, and as i stated, it is a nice fabric with a soft hand. it would be nice for a crisp fall day. that being said, the length just isn't right and does nothing for me. i'm five 8 and slender . i definitely do not think a petite woman would like this or be"
0,"Pilling problem Soft, cozy, and cute, but pilled badly after 1st wearing and now will be relegated to wearing at home only.
for this reason i cannot recommend. felt like i wasted my money.
i purchased the xs petite ( i'm 5'1"". 95 lbs) and i could have gone down to xxs, but i was ok with it being looser."
0,"Cute, but... Wanted to love this dress, bit it wasn't to be. strange fit, and doesn't drape nicely, as in the photo. also, the blue color was much darker in person. wouldn't recommend."
1,"Easy-fitting dress for casual summer days I ordered this dress online and didn't really know what to expect. but to my surprise, it's exactly what i had hoped it would be. the dress is a fantastic fit and has a modern, interesting print. the fabric does seem thin for the price. but i am not returning it. it's a casual summer dress that kicks up my look a notch on weekends. i wear it with beige sandals, and the gray and beige look good together too."
1,"Super soft way to change up a basic outfit! Like the other reviewers said, it has a lot of bulky fabric if you wear it as pictured. i tried it on and tied the string around the back so it's an open vest. i love if!"
1,"Love this dress! I really love the fit of this dress. i said it runs true to size, and it really does--even with the stretch fabric around the back and adjustable straps, i would not recommend sizing down as i normally do at retailer--there is no stretch to the actual fabric on the dress. i'd never bought anything by this brand before, and i would say that the fabric is quite thin for the price of the dress, and it is not lined (i'm still hoping it's not see through). however, for me, the style makes up for"
1,"Runs very large The shirt is great, aside from the fact that it runs very large. i ordered an xs when i usually wear a s and it is still very big on me. the color is great though, and the fabric is more comfortable than i expected. i still wear it occasionally with pants or skirts that i can easily tuck it in to."
0,"At once matronly and sexy? So the dress is interesting. has an asymmetrical wrap look, short, sexy length (i'm 5'3"" and the petite barely covers my assets), and a neckline that implies sexy without actually displaying the girls- it crosses over and stays closed, but looks sexy and plunging. but the shoulders are what make it look matronly. they're wide- from neck out to the outer edge of my shoulder/upper arm. they show no shoulder at all, which is really an odd design when the rest of the dress is sexy-ish. i looked back"
1,"Lovely dress and fit This dress is extremely flattering on and looks a lot better when worn than on the hanger. the cut drapes very nicely and is true to size. i am 5 feet tall / 95lbs and the xxsp fit perfectly. it is a bit short however, so i would caution that it may not be work ""office"" appropriate if you are taller. like most hd in paris dresses, it is also quite thin although lined. this dress would look lovely with a either delicate jewelry or a bold statement piece and is casual enough for a lunch outing or"
1,"I own this top in 3 colors! I bought the gray and white to take on a trip. i wore it nearly every other day. looks good layered with a cami or short sleeved t-shirt. also threw on a blazer one chilly night and it looked nice enough to have a dinner out.came home and bought it in red and white and solid white. true to size. not clingy, not baggy and comes down just long enough to cover the tummy."
0,Nope I was looking for a casual dress for quick errands that was trendy but comfy.  this dress had a lot of potential [i was drawn to the print]  but the material is awful. so thin and scratchy! immediately went back.
0,"Cute but not right for me I really, really wanted to love this dress. the v-neck plunge is way too deep. i needed to pin it to keep it closed. the blue color was pretty, and the front was flattering, but the back was not. it was super clingy in the back and didn't hang in a flattering way. sadly, i sent it back."
1,"So soft and cozy I love wearing this sweater, it is unbelievably soft and cozy. usually a sweater like this sits like an unflattering sack on me, so i was pleasantly surprised by how flattering it was on my petite frame. i purchased a grey xs regular in store and i am 5'3"" 120 lbs and it was long, but not at all overwhelming. it sat very flattering on my figure and kept me warm at work on this rainy cold day. i wore mine with skinny capri jeans and purple suede kitten heels. would look great with leggings and bo"
1,"So comfortable! I bought this sweater in the gray color and love it! it is so very comfortable, very soft. it looks great with jeans or leggings."
1," I ordered this bra in my normal size 32d, and it fits me perfectly. this bra is beautiful. the material seems to be very high quality, and the comfort of this bra is amazing. it's definitely a keeper."
1,"So comfortable I love this sweater. i bought it on sale in maroon and it is the most comfortable sweater ever. i like to wear it with leggings. it has a nice, oversize fit and is perfect for ""fat"" days. or any day."
1, I was looking for a top to go with leggings that didn't look like a sack and this is perfect. the v-neck and unusual cut on the bottom makes it more interesting than a typical tunic and the fabric is so snuggly. love it.
1,"Gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous Beautiful piece! the model actually doesn't do this piece justice. it is stunning. a light, yet quality fabric that drapes effortlessly and ties comfortably. great with a white tee and sllm jeans. runs ever so slighty large, but i took my normal size (xs) and for the type of piece it is, it works."
1,"Awesome Wonderful, slimming leggings. snappy and a great accessory for any professional outfit."
1,"Detailing is amazing I have tried this on several times now and have yet to pull the trigger. i like the coral color the best for its versatility. the detailing on this cardigan is fantastic. i especially like the back, the stitching is already very flattering, but then the pleats really add an extra touch. the only reason i have not bought it yet is that i wish it was slightly longer-especially with it being a cashmere piece. i am slightly worried about it shrinking in any way, which would make it much too short an"
1,"Gorgeous versatile velvet top I love this top-it fits true to size, hits at the low hip so its not too short, and can be worn casually or dressed up. i wore it with ripped ag stevie ankle jeans, freebird by stevie worn brown buckled ankle boots, and a glittery silver necklace, but it would have also looked good with turquoise jewelry. i also plan to pair it with the cabernet-turquoise cecelia prado sparkly skirt, tights and boots, and a jean jacket or black moto jacket. this top would also look amazing with the sanctuary arm"
1,Cute style This jacket is cute and comfy!
1,"Love this romper I had never tried on a romper or jumper. the print of this changed my mind and i'm glad for it. it looks amazing on is easy to wear. i kind of wish it were lined but it's probably better unlined to keep it light and cool for the summer. 

i did end up using double stick take bc the front was so low but it was worth it."
1,"Great versatile top Pictures do not do this top justice. looks much cuter in person !
it caught my eye right away in the store.
perfect top for when the weather starts getting a little cooler."
0,"No Just a ginormous, shapeless shirt. runs extremely large. i am normally a medium to large in shirts and the medium was huge. i can only imagine an xs would work and i am no xtra small!"
1,"Perfect light jacket for fall/spring This jacket is exactly what i was looking for! it is a lightweight and comfortable material that will be perfect for fall/spring (and for layering during a mild winter!). i am 5'3, 128 lbs, and generally wear a small - but i ordered a medium in this jacket and am happy i sized up. the jacket is roomy, but the cinched waist makes it flattering rather than shapeless. i'd definitely recommend this anorak to anyone!"
1,Perfection I loved the contrasting design of this sweater. i loved it even more when it arrived. its soft and true to size. i received so many compliments which sealed the deal.
1,Sweet sweater It's maybe a bit longer than i'd like but cute-great with slacks or dresses!
1,"So soft I happened upon this one in store in my xs size. online it would not catch my eye, but in person i love it. it fits like a glove and is so soft and elegant with the knit detailing, pleats, and length in the back. i couldn't pass this one up. i also agree with the other reviewers about colors:/"
1,"Love I'm usually a small or medium in retailer tops, however, jackets i tend to wear a small......liking a more fitted look. this jacket i also purchased a small, but there is plenty of room, so might have even worn an xs. anyway, the material is great, is well made, wonderful pocketsi, super comfy, but maybe a little too warm for summer nights. i cuffed up the sleeves......had no issue with the length. i'm 5'6"", 36c and i couldn't be happier with this purchase. happy mother's day to me!"
1,Gorgeous! Can't wait to wear this during the holidays. beautiful embroidery and detailing.
1,Perfect for summer evenings I love love this sweater it's beautiful on and super comfy. my only complaint is that it had a snag and a hole in the back. so i can't say it's good quality.
1,"Very nice This coat is very soft and flattering in design. good quality and very comfortable. i usually wear a small which is what i got and it fits well. if anything, it is a little snug across the shoulders when i reach forward, so if you plan on wearing a heavier layer underneath, go up a size."
1,"Sorry i returned these Pants were super comfortable. a little too large. and the fabric was a little too heavy. i sent them back, and i'm regretting it now that they're completely unavailable."
1,"Great piece I bought the ivory in my usual size xs and the fit is flattering and quality is good. it is a good weight for spring, summer and fall. i love that it is a natural cotton/linen blend. the turquoise was not available in my size initially but when it restocked for a short time i ordered it, also! i know i won't be disappointed. beautiful sweater with great details."
1," The fabric is very nice and it is completely lined, except for the sleeves, which are sheer. i expected the dress to be lighter, so wearing this on a hot day won't work. i ordered an xs because of the former reviews it said it ran large and it does. it's roomy, straight, and quite flowy.  i wanted a casual non clinging dress and it's just like the picture. it hits below the knee."
1,"Timeless black velvet top This is a classic, well made, velvet top. it fits true to size, is very flattering ,the on- line photos don't do it justice. very pretty in real life. 34a 123 lbs ordered the xs."
0,Not for the full figured This would be a great blouse for flat chested person. i am a size 12 and busty. i ordered an xl and it was ridiculously tight across the chest and the fabric is see through. you would need to wear a cami under it.
1,Beautiful jacket This is a really lovely jacket - silky soft fabric in a pretty color and quality construction throughout. i am so sad that it runs very small - especially in the arms and across the chest. i will be returning it .
1," This top is exactly as described. it can be casual with jeans or dressed up for evening wear. i would have kept it but it was slightly tight across the chest. i am 5' 1 1/2"" tall, 112 lbs & purchased a petite small. my bra size is a 34a."
1," Love it! cute, flattering, and even though the material is thin - it is still very cozy. i have no complains about the quality; i haven't found any loose threads or other issues.

the cardigan runs tts. i got m instead of my usual s (because s was out of stock), and it's a little loose in the armpits. but i still like the cardigan and i'm keeping it."
0,"Has potentail I was really excited about this romper and when it arrived it looks just like the picture. the torso was abnormally long and i get this is supposed to be a relaxed fit but it sagged way too much for my liking. i'm 5'9"", 32c and i wear 28 size pants, usually i struggle with too short of a torso in romper/jumpsuits but not this one. i ordered a medium and felt like it was way too big. i probably could have gone down a size but i wasn't loving it enough to try. the fabric is nice but the tiny clasp"
1,Great spring/summer cardigan Was looking for something lighter as we go into warmer temperatures and this one is greatz looks just like pictured and ha a flattering fit.
1,"Just what i was looking for. I had been looking for a green jacket with a hood just like this one and was thrilled to find it. i found the fit to be true to size. i am 5'4, 107 pounds and i bought the xs, which is my usual size in retailer jackets. i love the material and the way it hangs so casually."
1,This is a wow!!! Went to the local store today for something else and left with this in the cream color. it is just simply awesome. i could have worn the s but felt that the m would be a little better. i'm between a s and m most of the time. can't say enough good things about the quality and versatility of this sweater. great piece for cooler summer nights and for a cover up for pilates/yoga. can't wait to wear it and now i'm tempted by the teal.
1,"Fun pattern These pants are a fun way to mix it up from the usual dark, solid colored pants. the print is a perfect balance between subtle and bold. the fabric is soft and stretchy and i love that these pants are washable. i i'm petite (5'2"") but my petite size was sold out so i bought these pants in the regular length. they are soooo long that i think even the petite size wouldn't have ended up cropped on me. having said that, i like them enough that i plan to keep them and have them shortened. i usually s"
1, Just bought this weekend and had to size down. i'm usually a small in jackets and went with the xs. retailer has had this style for the last few years and i've missed out so finally was able to buy before they sold out!! well worth the price point. i think it will be a very versatile jacket. for sizing reference i'm 5'7 and 135lbs.
1,"Intricate knit stitches Cashmere is soft as a feather, yet warm, easy to wear and the pointelle stitches are lovely. i feel lovely wearing this and i'm really not that kind of ""lady"". so, if you imagine a side of yourself wanting to try out feeling lovely, bite the bullet and buy this cardigan. it does run small in my bust area, but all the rest fits well."
1,"Cute and comfy This jacket is so comfortable and high quality fabric. i love the color and style and easiness of just throwing it on. the only thing that i wasn't completely satisfied with is that it is a little bit bulky around the hips with the pockets. however, i am 5'0"" so that may be more of a length issue for me. overall, this jacket is really nice."
1,"Lovely and comfortable I finally bought this top after eyeing it in the store for sometime. the design adds a bit of edge to a top that could get matronly very quickly. it goes great with a nice pair of jeans and some pumps - you're ready for a night out! my only critique is that i'm a bit busty (38c) so in the center of the top where the v of the neckline meets the shirt, there is some pulling. it's not completely noticeable, and doesn't make it uncomfortable in the least. love this shirt and so happy i finally indul"
1,"My first romper This is the first romper i've ever purchased and i'm instantly in love. it's flows, the colors are vibrant and the pockets are practical. looking forward to wearing it for the rest of the season as well as next year."
1,"Super cute Was excited to find an retailer pkg awaiting in my mailbox. ripped open the package and immediately tried on the sweater. it did not disappoint. i bought turquoise in size medium. my regular retailer cardigan size. i am 5'3"" medium build and i find the regular size fits me true to size. it isn't too long on me at all. i think the way the sweater drapes in a curve shape as it flows downs to the length of sweater makes it very accommodating for various heights, figures and is a flattering style for cu"
1,Buy it! I love this jacket and can't get enough of it. it has side pockets as well as the buttoned-pockets. i love the cinched waist option for a more fitted look.
1,"Great pants; run large I am 5'5. 125 pounds, size 4-ish (sometimes a 4, sometimes a 6), athletic build. these pants fit great except they are pretty large around the waist, about 2 extra inches of space. i don't think the problem would be fixed by sizing down since only the waist was large. i will need to get them tailored."
1,"Nice cardi I wish i had sized up on this one. you can't tell from the photo, but has kind of a weird taper thing where the sides are shorter than the back. the back is extremely flatteringly, but the front... not so much. the shorter sides are a little awkward. there is no attached way to fasten this cardigan, and it lays kind of strange. the material is a medium thickness and i think will be very versatile. very soft, of course. i got the blue/ teal color. i found the color to be true to the color on-line"
1,"Great print I'm 5'5"" 120 lbs and i bought these in a 0. they fit great. i wore them for upwards of 12 hours and i was very comfortable. i received compliments on the print and cut. very flattering."
1,"Great dress The detailing on this dress is beautiful. the cotton fabric is good quality and has a nice weight to it. i love the print.
as for the fit, i sized down one size because of the reviews, and the s fit perfectly. i am a 34 d, and the dress is slightly snug in the bust and perfectly fitted in the waist. i line dried the dress because of that. the zipper does stick a little at the waist when zipping. i can't wait to wear it."
1,"Runs super small Holy cow does this run small-like really small. i ordered the normal size i would wear and couldn't even get it passed my legs-until i supplied the most amount of effort i could (against my better judgment) and managed to get it on-but it was definitely too small. i would classify myself as petite and my normal size was way too short on my torso. it, of course, was a mistake to force it on because it was just as hard to get it off.

that said, i love the suit and am going to try in one and 2 siz"
1,"Stunning one piece suit I just received this beautiful suit. i have purchased a boyleg from seafolly before and loved it!
this color way is totally different. it is a white background with a floral pattern that is not over the top.
i am a 32 dd and wear a clothing size 4. i purchased the 6. this suit definitely will accommodate small bust too.
my sister is a 34 b size 4 clothing and it fit as well.
way to go retailer with another winner!!!!"
1,"Perfect jeans I am 5'6"", 130lbs, size 27, short-legged, and these jeans fit perfectly. i've learned that pilcro's serif fit is my go to, and these did not disappoint. not only are they a flattering fit, they are the ideal medium blue denim, and they aren't covered in excessive whiskering, which seems to plague most jeans."
1,"Easy, breezy style Good quality dress, except the lining is very sheer and thin. the inner strap of the lining ripped when i tried it on, so be careful putting it on. once on, it fits true to size, the lining is nice to have, so i kept it even though the strap ripped. if you are on the fence between sizes i would recommend going smaller to avoid having this style of dress look maternity on you."
1,"Great fitting jean. I could live in these jeans, they are so comfortable. they are have the perfect amount of stretch and the fabric is so soft. i was skeptical because that usually means they lose their shape and i'm yanking on them all day, however, i have worn them 3 days now and on the third day they may have stretched a little in the waist. i am normally a 28, but can get away with 27 sometimes; i chose the 28 and felt the fit was perfect. by the way, i'm wearing the jeans with the cubanas ciara glitter boots,"
1,Comfort and style I love these jeans! the perfect amount of stretch. very figure flattering. perfect for lounging around or a night out.
0,"Wish this worked for me... I absolutely fell in love with this dress when i saw it online, but unfortunately, it just didn't fit right. the bust and bodice not designed for curves, and the dress just didn't fit correctly, i think it would work better on very slim figures."
1,"Great suit for many body types I felt compelled to write a review to tell everyone to size up. i am 5'4"", 130 lbs, 34d and normally wear a size 4 (give or take). i debated between the 6 & 8 after reading the reviews and went with the 8 and so glad i did! if you're in doubt between sizes even after sizing up, go up one more, especially if you're bigger up top. mine fit *okay* in them but probably could have even done better with a larger cup. what's weird is that they sew in liner cups so you can't remove them without cutting"
1," Love this top! so soft and sweet! only complaint is that it's a bit short and a tad boxy for my 5'9"" 140#  frame (i also have boobs, so that doesn't help the fit of this piece).  going to tuck in the front into high waisted jeans! keeping it!"
1,"Great purchase I adore this top! the tencel fabric feels like a nicely worn out denim shirt that's been worn for years. it is a versatile piece that can be worn year round.  even if the sleeves are pulled onto the shoulders,  it still works and looks just fine. i'm broad in the shoulders, and we'll endowed,  but the large was perfect."
0,"Odd fit Agree with previous reviewer. i am usually an xs p in this brand (5'3"" 115 lbs) but i could not get the internal slip over my head. the chest area was fitted (i am a 32b) but then the skirt was very full and loose. i could have cut out the slip, but worried it would be see through and just not worth it at full price."
1,"Beautiful dress, runs large I bought this dress to wear to my low-key backyard rehearsal dinner. the dress it's self is beautiful, good quality, and a perfect summer maxi. however, it was way too big. i'm 5'6, 118 lbs, i typically wear an xs/0 and felt like i was swimming in fabric. i loved the style and make of the dress, so i choose to get it tailored."
0,"They look great but are poorly made I purchased these in january and today i am going back to retailer to request a refund; the fabric on the inner thighs are absolutely thread bare. i am 5'6 and wear a size 28. they fit comfortably with great stretch, but apparently the fabric is so cheap that if your thighs should happen to touch, you will wear holes through the thighs in very short order.

first they started piling, which i had never a pair of pilcro pants do before, and within 2 washes i could actually see through the f"
1,"Soft and fabulous I love these jeans, but they do stretch out! i was surprised at how loose they were right after washing/air drying the first time."
0,"Too small and too large at the same time Quality piece except the fit is way off. i have a 32 c bust and long narrow torso, larger on the bottom. i ordered the small. i frequently wear a small/extra small on top and i was busting out of this in the chest area. however, the fit then flares way out from the torso and it just looked dumpy and overpowered my 6 foot frame. i marked it as running small, which it does on top, but then it runs very large on bottom. wanted it to work, but didn't."
1,Great jeans! The jeans are even better in person. great fit and the color is nice. my new fave!
1,"Love love love!! Hesitant at first to spend so much on a swimsuit. definitely worth the money, quality all around..style..fit. appreciated the review i read prior to purchase, to size up! so happy i was able to get it on sale as well! $120.00 roughly but can see why it cost so much!"
1,"Versatile off the shoulder Cloth & stone has to be one of the best brands at retailer! they consistently produce versatile, comfortable and quality pieces time and again. off the shoulder is back and here to stay, and without a doubt, this is one of the best i've tried on. the denim is a perfect, summery shade, but will transition well into fall with some darker denim or black jeans. i am 5'7, shoulders that are neither narrow nor broad, and a little busty - i got a size m and it fits great. i absolutely love my shir"
1,"Perfect fit! These jeans are perfect in every way. the rise is perfect, the stretch is perfect. we need more washes in this exact fit. i wish there was more consistency between pilcro denim washes of the same style!"
1,"A great off the shoulder top that ......wait... It stays on .... i mean off the shoulders. the price is shocking, love the low price, but by no means id cheap. really love this little beauty"
1," I purchased this dress while vacationing in florida and cannot wait for the midwest weather to warm up so i can wear it. i am tall (5'8"") and love how this dress fits me. i found the slip to work well with the dress and that it was not too sheer. the length was perfect, not too short in the front and just enough drape in the back. i love that the slip is attached so it lines up perfectly."
0,"Wanted to love I've been looking for the perfect white eyelet maxi, feels like a perfect summer staple...but sadly this was not it. quality isn't great which is surprise on a $168 price tag. top of dress is lined but cheaply so it's somewhat see through. the dress was returned."
1,"Best jeans I am short and curvy and pilcro has the best fitting, most comfortable and most cute jeans around. i buy exclusively pilcro now. these jeans were excellent."
0,"Not truly legging jeans I really wanted to love these, i bought them in a rush because i needed to replace my skinny jeans asap. they were a little long and didn't quite hug my calves but i figured with hemming they would be fine. i was told they wouldn't stretch out much. well, they fit great at the waist but the legs are now huge on me and i can't get them to shrink. wish i spent a little more on a different skinny jean. too late to return, so my hoping to be going out jeans are now lazy day jeans."
1,"Great vintage inspired bathing suit I love seafolly boyleg bathing suits. i find them very flattering and just universally appealing. this one has beautiful summery design as well. i found it to be running slightly smaller than plain colored editions of this suit. i normally wear size 6 (us size) of this suit, but this particular design 6 was too small and had to exchange for 8(us) which fits perfect."
1,"The denim god's answered my prayers! I have been wearing joe's jean's for years and have a hefty stable of varieties in my wardrobe. recently, 3 pairs of their skinny leggings have worn out much quicker than expected which has caused me to question their construction and overall durability. i have had my eye on these pilco legging jeans for a while but every time i have gone to pull the trigger, my size has been sold out. finally, all the stars aligned just as i bid my final pair of joe's skinny's ""adieu"" and i was able to purchase"
1,Love these jeans! I love these jeans. they can be dressed up or dresses down. super cute with tall boots or loafers. i wear them all the time.
1,"I think i'll just live in these permanently! Ok, so to be honest i just bought these two days ago so as far as wear and tear i'll have to get back to you on that but i seriously think i will just live in these. first they are so so comfortable, soft material, stretchy but not so thin that they accentuate every little curve but also very flattering. i'm 5'4"" 127 lbs, curvy in the bottom with a smallish waist and purchased size 28. there is a little bit of room, which i'm happy with, so they don't squeeze the love handle area or make it unco"
1,"Perfect one size down These jeans are really soft, comfortable, and flattering, but only after you go a size down. all the other pilcro jeans i've bought have been a consistent 30, but when i got these they were baggy. i exchanged them for a 29, and they were just the ticket."
1," I liked the jeans, but exchanges them for ag's stevie ankle jeans due to the difference in length. i love pilcro, but these were just a bit too long on me."
1,"My new favorite jeans! I cannot say enough excellent things about these jeans...they fit beautifully, have just enough stretch and sit high enough on my waist to cover any unsightly rolls. this was my first pilcro purchase, and i will definitely be adding other styles to my closet in the near future. typically, i'm a size 32 or 14 in denim, but i sized down to a 31 in these after the sales associate made that suggestion. i'm so glad i did...they are a perfect fit!"
1,Great fit These are form fitting and have a great wash. the size runs large so i would say consider to go down one size than you usually wear. the bottom tapers so they are great to wear wtih flats or can easily fit into boots.
0,Disappointing Ordered this vest on line and returned it due too poor quality .
1,"Great sweater, but color is inaccurate This sweater is really cute, and comfortable - but the color is a tad off from the picture. it's a deeper blue than i was expecting, and the pocket is not a ""rust"" color as depicted online. it's definitely closer to red. other than that, i still do like it - the speckles are a nice touch, and it is true to size, and not too short."
1, This dress is so pretty. the tulle underskirt was a fun surprise and the subtle striping in the dress so classy. the dress is true to size. my main concern was making sure the top part would fit around my chest. it fits perfectly.
1,Petite fits great! I received this as a gift for my birthday in the navy blue and it fits great. i'm 5'2 and the petite medium was the perfect length.
1,Flattering style I purchased this dress in the store and then realized i could get a petite size. i ordered it in a pm but had to return it. i reordered it in ps and it's perfect. i love it for a casual evening out of wearing around town in the summer. it's supper figure flattering.
1," Gorgeous! this dress fit so well and it super flattering. i got it in green and the colors are just lovely. i had to get it hemmed because i'm short and i couldn't find it in petite, but definitely worth the extra cost. i love, love love it."
1,"Runs large, esp. in black! Just received two, the red and the black. the black is a great print, very versatile. both run large, but the black most significantly so. the red is close enough to fitting to keep. the black shows my bra b/c it is so large and the armholes cut far too deeply. (the red also shows a fair amount of the armpit area, but (barely) covers my bra.

the material is somewhat thinner than expected, but not so sheer that a skin-toned bra wouldn't be sufficient."
1," The print on this is gorgeous, and it's incredibly comfortable. ultimately, i didn't buy it because the length was weird for me (i'm 5'7""); it just looked strange, like it was cutting me off at a weird point."
1,"A sweet top I just purchased this adorable top at my local retailer store, not really expecting to find anything, i saw this one so i tried it on in my usual size small and it fit me perfectly (34d-27-35). i bought the black with the colorful print and think it's even prettier in person. it looks cute with the ties either open or closed and the material is nice and soft. also, the arm holes aren't too large which is always a nice plus:)"
1,"Dress perfection I don't think it's possible to say enough good things about this dress! the fit is beautiful (i'm 5'6"", 130lbs, and am a 32h,) the material is soft and swishes around your legs in a delightful way, and the length has all the positives of a maxi dress without dragging on the ground. it doesn't show bra straps. it looks good with either heels or a trusty pair of birkenstocks. the pattern is fun. essentially, it's the perfect summer dress."
1,"Love it!!! I bought this item in store, in the loden green color. i absolutely love it as a light winter dress or tunic. the material is thin, but provides a nice coverage nonetheless. it is super duper comfy, and very figure flattering! i wear it mainly as a dress, and looks great with tights and ankle boots. so pleased ordering the other color."
1,"Nice addition to spring pieces I like this top. it provides a nice pop to the fall/winter dark wardrobe pieces. the picture gives off a blue hue, but the top is black, kind of a dusty black. the picture also gives the impression that the leaves are turquoise, but they're actually more green. at any rate, it is nice addition to my very dark winter wardrobe. i cannot wait to wear it with white denim like the model and something in the green family. i definitely recommend it."
1," I ordered this pullover in green, size large. the color is lovely and the fabric feels great. however, it was tight (even though i often wear a medium). unfortunately it will be going back."
1,"Love!! more colors please!! I love this dress! it is beyond flattering! i tried the south shore dress on earlier this year but found it too short for my taste. this however.. is the same cut on top, but longer in the skirt! yes, please! i purchased the turquoise, which is exactly as pictured! just beautiful! hits at my shins. for reference, i'm 5'6"", 136 lbs and ordered a size small."
0,"Cute but... Cute top in theory...ended up looking a little sloppy. the sleeves are a bit too ""blousey"" for my taste and i really wanted the lace-up to be cuter, somehow. still a cute top, received several compliments, but not for me."
1,"Great fit and so comfortable lightweight jean! These jeans are great for the summer, they have a great high waist fit and stretch with you.  very very comfortable.  rinse is light making them a little casual but they can be dressed up with heels.  love them!"
0,"Tighter than expected I ordered this in green when it was on sale and was so excited to get it. i thought the color would compliment my complexion perfectly. i read the other reviews who mentioned this item fit closer to the body than what is shown on the model - i wish i would have listened. while it is a very comfortable piece and stretches, it is a lot tighter than i wanted and because of that it is a bit see through. i didn't want to have to wear a cami underneath and i am pretty curvy. this top does show many of"
1, I normally don't care for rayon clothing but the fabric feels nice and it is flattering in the way it fits. i got my usual medium and it fits well. it has a nice drape and is not see through.
1,"Beautiful fit! As a teacher, it's so great to be able to find dresses that are modest and beautiful, that i can wear to work, as well as on the weekends."
1,"Comfy top I bought the black and love it. i bought both the medium and large but am going to keep the medium. it was plenty roomy. i'm 5'2"" and about fluctuate between 125-130 lbs. i usually wear a medium or large in retailer-wear but i like things roomy. have to hide a little extra these days!"
1,"Easy breezy summer top I absolutely love this blouse! it's easily one of my favorite retailer finds in several seasons. it is quite roomy, so anyone hoping for a more form fitting cut won't find it here. this is the type of fit i prefer for summer though, as missouri is just disgustingly humid and i can't stand to wear anything clingy once it heats up. it's sheer, so a cami is required. it's also wrinkle prone, but the fabric is almost like a gauze and is not meant to be perfectly pressed and crisp. it's perfect to thro"
0," I would not recommend these pants if you have a curvy or athletic figure. these pants seem to be cut straight up and down. the fabric is not soft, the color is slightly more muted in person, and they are not as relaxed as they appear to be on the model."
1,"Pretty but a bit shapeless I got this top in the black floral print. the print is very pretty and so is the neckline, but the body is very loose and shapeless. it's not flattering. i think the shirt is a little too short as well. it would be nicer if it was longer. nevertheless, it is a pretty top."
1, Very flattering cut. only con is that is seems to snag easily. extremely comfortable and don;t need to wear a cami under it like i originally thought i would.
1, Pants fit great. true to size. did not stretch like some of the retailer pants that you need to buy in a smaller size. love that the calf is bigger than most of their pants which are usually too narrow for my bigger calves. very comfy look great with a white shirt and tie die is subtle. they will be a staple summer pair of pants.
1,"Flattering fit! Wow this dress is very flattering! i have a fairly small waist and not-so-small hips and this dress is slimming. it is also soft, light, airy, gorgeous! exactly what you need on a beautiful spring day! i wore this dress yesterday and have not felt that beautiful in a very long time! thank you so much retailer for the brilliant design:)"
1,"Perfect fit! Purchased this maxi dress in blue print, size petite xxsmall. even in that size i have some difficulty finding dresses that fit. but this one does perfectly. no complaints at all. length is a bit longer than pictured on model, but that's fine for a maxi summer easy style dress. i am quite short besides being petite so this fits the bill. am sure it will be worn quite often for many different occasions."
0,"Meh It just isn't that flattering on me. it looks kind of old and dingy, even though it's brand new. it fits fine, but doesn't do much to highlight my curves. it just kind of hangs there. the length is somewhat awkward (i bought the petite version). maybe it would look good on someone tall and skinny, like the model. it's gathered around the stomach area and longer in the front, which reminded me of maternity wear. it does appear to be pretty well made; top part is lined. overall it's not terrible,"
1,"Darling dress! This is such a darling velvet dress. understated, yet eye catching, i am very fond of it. the cut is flattering to all and the gathered fabric does not add bulk to the waist. there is a fun tulle underskirt to give just the right amount of volume. the straps creep ever so slightly toward being off shoulder, but fear not because there are loops and fasteners to hold your bra in place.

i am very thrilled to have found my holiday party dress so early and can't wait to wear it!"
1,"Elegant, graceful, lovely This dress has a really elegant neckline combined with the wide fitted waist and under-the-bust gathers which really flatter the body. i have a fairly straight body and this dress gives me shape. i usually wear xspetite but the turquoise didn't come in petite and that was my preferred color. so i tried the xxs which i could barely get on and off but once on, it fit fine (34aa, 26"" waist, 34"" hips). i'd probably be better off with the xs. the length of the regular on me was fine, like a normal ma"
1,"Perfect dress! This dress is the perfect length and so comfortable! it's conservative enough to wear to work as a teacher but also so cute! i'm 5'6"" and the large hits right above my ankle. medium fit as well but i wanted a little extra room in the torso."
1,"Love this top I desperately needed some new work clothes, so i ordered this and a few other shirts online. this was the only one that fit me really well and that i really liked! it's a bit pricey for a tanktop, but it feels really well made. the material is soft and comfortable and the ruffle details and the print are beautiful. the small fits me perfectly (5'7"", 150 lbs, 36a) and it's not short like a lot of other shirts i try on, (which my coworkers probably appreciate since no one wants to see me flashing"
0,Unimpressed This top was much more fitted than expected and was not flattering. i would not recommend.
0,"Wrong for me This is really a cute top, nice fabric, the print (the version i bought) is lovely though the colors are different than pictured. the problem for me is that i am 5'8"", 36b with a longer torso and the proportions were just wrong on my body. the blouse does not have much shape at all and fell a bit too short for my liking, especially in the front. it hit at hip level, as in photo, but would look so much better if it had been a couple inches longer. looking at the other reviews i see that most of t"
1,"Lovely tank This was a bit of an impulse purchase but i'm glad i added it! it's a pretty standard tank, but is thoughtfully and well made. for example, the arm holes are not enormous like they are on some tops. i wish everything fit like this. the cut at the neckline isn't too modest or too low and the fold over of the drawstrings are structured enough that they don't flop over."
1,"Perfect summer tank! I just received this in the mail and i was so surprised how flattering it is!  i ordered the print and i can see wearing this to work, out with friends or for date night!  perfect summer tank!  comfortable and flattering!  a great addition to my wardrobe! it fit true to size for me!"
1,Print looks just like the photo This is a really pretty print on a decent top. the only reason i returned is because it didn't look good with my skin tone and the fabric is thin. i'd planned to use it as a later under cardigans.
1,"Love this dress This dress is gorgeous. flattering, comfortable, and machine washable!

for reference i am 5'5 145lbs, 38-30-40 and 34dd. i got the medium and it fits great! only flaw is that the armholes are a little large, but not enough that my bra shows so i am okay with it."
1, This dress is very comfortable. the fabric is really nice and the dress flows when you move. classic and pretty. i ordered a xs and i'm 5'3 135lbs 34b and the fit was great.
1,"Stylish top I really liked the lace up details and embroidery. the sleeves were too long for me and i was not a fan of the elastic on the sleeve...made it tough to push sleeves up. i took to my seamstress and her cut elastic out and hem the sleeve. 
now its perfect!"
0,"Not as expected The material was thin, showed every lump you'd rather hide and clung to the body. even the sleeves were tight. looked inexpensive."
1,"Easy elegance I wanted this dress in the turquoise motif, but it sold out so quickly! i tried on about 10 dresses in my local store and this was the clear winner. i got the blue and white motif, which has enough visual interest with the way the pattern flows across the dress. i found the dress to be slimming and very comfortable. you can throw it on and not think about flashing anything when you bend over, or the skirt flying up in the breeze, or needing a strapless bra. the skirt flows really nicely and over"
1,"Cute & comfy Really cute top, comfy, with just enough flare that it can be dressed up a bit, or worn just casual. not clingy at all...in fact, maybe just a tad too flowy around the middle, but not so much that it kept me from going back to buy it immediately in a second color! i typically wear a large, but suspect the arms on the medium might be a tad small if i sized down."
1,Casual comfort chic I saw this top and loved the pattern. meadow rue is one of my favorite brands for tops at retailer. the pattern is lovely and the fit it tts. this top is comfortable for running errands and can be dressed up too. very versatile for spring.
1,"Must have summer dress for any occasion! This dress looks way better on you than sitting on the hanger! the design really flatters your body and the waist area, makes you look very skinny! highly recommend! the length is also perfect, just the right length for a maxi dress, long enough but short enough to show off your shoes as well!"
1,Loved it and wanted it but... No size fit me. i'm normally a s to m. the small had huge armholes on me and the xs was just a wee bit off somehow. perhaps in length. so i ended up without it sadly. it's really a very nice top and great quality. i was unhappy to leave it behind.
1,"Lovely interesting white top I bought this in my usual size small, and love it. looks great with skinnies or pencil skirts. not sheer enough to need a cami, but enough to look cottony and breezy. very elegant. it falls flatteringly on my shape - 34c, 28-38, 5'3"". it has an elegant, arty vibe. if you have a long torso or big chest, i would say try it on in the store to make sure the chest area falls well for you."
1,"My new favorite dress Got this dress in the blue and cream and it's gorgeous. i love that it's work and date night appropriate, but so comfy. i am 5'4"" but have very short legs, so it's hard to find a maxi dress or skirt that doesn't drag on the ground. this floats beautifully above my ankles - a little lower than on the model, but still high enough that i am totally comfortable wearing the dress without heels. i got the small and it fits great. the print is lovely - the cream fabric is speckled in gray dots in some"
1,"Bring back the turquoise please!! I have this in darker blue and it is my favorite dress of the season. i didn't realize that there was one in turquoise until it was already sold out. please bring back or be so kind to contact me if an xs comes in as a return, etc. 
i love this so much!"
1,"So in love The turquoise print is absolutely stunning. i love the feel of the fabric, the drape"
1,"Love the feel, love the fit! I hesitated to spend the money on this sweater but somehow knew it would be my go-to sweater for the season. when i tried it on, i knew i made the right decision - it feels luxurious and fits like a dream. the pop of color on the pocket is perfect to make a statement and to add something different from all those other sweaters! the fit is tts."
1,Fit is spectacular! This dress is more adorable on then sitting on the hanger. the material clings to all the right places and feels really good. i must say this is one of the most comfortable dresses i have ever put on. would never tell from the photo that this dress is so adorable. if you like a fitted dress in the waist and bust that subtly accentuates your curves - try it. adorable!
1,Amazing Sticker price was a shock but it is so worth it. it is the best little black dress i have ever owned. the lace is so soft and the dress is flattering. it is fun and flirty. this is a closet staple piece for sure!!! love this dress so much!
1,"Not true to size These run really small..almost 2 sizes up. so if you order these, i would order a few sizes to cover your basis. otherwise, good quality, good coverage. hopefully sizing up will fit me."
1,"Beautiful color and texture; fun shape This top is flowy and feminine. the pink is slightly more vivid than pictured online but is still a beautiful, soft pink (definitely not red). i was afraid the shape would be unflattering on my not-so-skinny figure but it's not. it's baggy all over, and there's plenty of room in the arms. note that dark pants/skirts will show through the fabric, so i like the shirt better with an untucked cami/tank top underneath it (so the gorgeous neckline isn't disturbed but the pink color runs true throughou"
1, I really love this shirt and bought it in several colors. i wish it came in white and in black because it's a great basic. i think it also works well for business casual attire.
1,My new favorite work pants Great trouser pants for summer with pretty jacquard print and neat denim detail at hem and waist band. usually wear a 6 in retailer but went up a size to 8 with these for looser trouser fit. fits my backend nicely which is always a plus. can't wait to wear them!
1,"Great design I spotted these on the sale rack and loved the design, the almost regal fabric toned down to casual by the cropped denim cuffs. they weren't my size, but, to my surprise they could be ordered in my size, still at the sale price.
the fit was perfect. they will surely make a statement wherever i choose to wear them."
1,"My carrie bradshaw jacket I'm always on the lookout for pieces that look polished, but aren't fussy. this is *that* blazer. i'm rather petite and bought the xs, though wish they had the petite in store to try on as xs is not very fitted on my frame. the perfect weight for 65 degree summer days."
1,"Love these pants! So so cute. i am 5' 7"" 150-155lbs and the 10 fit me perfectly. i expected the m or 10 to be too small. wore them the first day i received them. i have a large waist 34"". hips about 39"" and the 10 fits great, not tight. love the material and the workmanship is tops. i think they are a great buy especially on sale. wore them with a hei hei jacket also on sale, can't get much better."
1,Definitely runs small I bought the blue and it is beautiful. it definitely runs small and i agree with the other reviewer who stated to order 2 sizes up.
1," These are simply the best of everything i love about charlie trousers. great fit, classic styling with the pop of the unexpected. the fabric is thinner than it appears--perfect for spring and summer. the pattern of the damask is not overwhelming, but it works very well as a neutral if you want to mix patterns (which i do a lot), or if you want to pair it with an ivory blouse and a simple blue sweater or jacket.. roll down the pants for a more professional look during the day, roll them up for ca"
1,"Absolutely fabulous Wearing these for the first time today. the way the pants are made is the way a pair of quality pants should be. the fabric is gorgeous; the fit is excellent. the tone on tone flower is subtle but visible and creates a lovely pattern. the denim treatment at the ankle and waistband is a nice added touch. true to size, too. these are not your run of the mill above the ankle pants - they're something special and worth the money...the fact that i did get them on sale makes it an even better purchase"
1,"Nice material , but runs large This top looks real cute on the model! wish it looked like that on me! way too big, so not flattering on my petite frame. sadly going back!"
1,So soft Love this t. i now have all the colors. it is so soft and comfortable. great with jeans or dressed up with leggings and boots. and when i feeling lazy i just keep it on and use it as a night shirt to sleep in. it's that comfortable! i found the size to be spot on.
1,"So soft and flattering The deep v doesn't gape, and flatters the neckline, while the waist-high side slits reveal enough to keep this drapey shirt from looking shapeless. the material is so lovely and soft and comfy, but clings in the right places to really flatter, while problem areas get draped in the most perfect way."
1,"Comfortable and cute Love these jeans as they look great with dress shoes, running shoes or boots. fit well and true to size."
1,"Full sigourney weaver This jacket doesn't look all that special in the photos provided. i found it at my local store and i knew it was mine the moment i tried it on. it has that boxy shoulder look i associate with 80s power suits. i call this look: ""full sigourney weaver"" and it is marvelous! perfect for a lunch date with harrison ford circa 1988. so happy with this purchase. highly recommend!"
1,"Excellent pair of trousers I received the pants and they are really nice. you can dress them up or down. i ordered a size 0 in regular and they did not fit me well around my thighs, as they were loose. i will have to return them as they do not have my size in petites. i am a size 0 in petites and ordered the size 0 in regular. the only downside to the pants was it was hard to undo the buttons and found it rather difficult."
1, I just picked this up in store the other day! i absolutely love it! it is so easy to throw on real quick for a cute outfit.
1,"Perfect for petites My first review and first full price designer denim purchase....

i recently lost weight and in need to replace all my pants and in search of a dark wash high rise jeans (preferably in black), finally decided to buy this at full price online coz of all the fab reviews. i decided to purchase the 25p, thinking that i may return after receiving it in the mail since i wasn't able to try at the store and not sure if i got the right size, also it's not the high rise denim that i was looking for. but t"
1,Nice sweater. This was a very nice sweater but i had to return because it came too late for a birthday gift i was giving. it also was not the sweater i had originally thought i had ordered. my mistake. it was very soft and would be suitable for any type of figure.
1,"Perfect size! I was looking for a pair of ankle jeans to wear with booties. i love my regular length paige hoxton jeans but they are too long me (5'4"" 120) if i want to wear booties. i decided to try the petite size and.... perfecto!!! just the right length and the rest of the fit was just like my other paige jeans. i love when you can count on sizing to stay true across styles."
0,"Clown jacket. 1. this looks so cute on the model, doesn't it? i have no idea where you wear a suit with hot pants, but it looks cute.

2. that said, keep in mind the model is probably 6 feet 10 inches tall. i'm 5 feet 6 inches tall, and this jacket came down to my knees. i'm not kidding. the 3/4 length sleeves were at my wrist, so more like 7/8 sleeves.

3. i'm normally a size 12 in cartonnier jackets, but this only comes s, m or l. the medium is really a size 10, which was too tight across the shoulders and"
1,Pretty top Ordered the nude color for my daughter. love the color and the style. it's a.comfortable looking top. i pressed it before giving it to her. seemed to wrinkle easily. that's why i gave it three stars. probably wrinkle less if it had some polyester in it.
1,"Order down Cute shirt, it looked big so i ordered a size smaller. worked fine. would have liked the option to go even smaller so i would suggest ordering down. ultimately too baggy on my frame so sending back. fun shirt though!"
1,"Exactly as pictured, adorable spring top Love this top. it is exactly as pictured online. it's a beautiful coral pink color - perfect for summer (i think the description says ""red"" but it is definitely pink). i love the swiss dot material, the bell sleeves, the ruffled bottom. they all work perfectly together to make for an adorable top. it almost seems as if it can be worn off the shoulder, due to the elastic neckline, but i prefer it on, as pictured on the model. 

the fit is tts. i ordered an xs and that is what i usually wear fro"
1,"Size it smartly I loved this jacket when i tried it on in the store, and brought home a size med. it's a nice weight of material, lined, and very classy. i liked the idea of adding it to my collection of suit-jackets for business meetings. but when i tried it on again using actual outfits from my closet, i realized how much it looked like a lab-coat. i am not giving up-- if it goes on sale, i'll order a small, to see if it is more flattering. but at this point, it's a no-go."
1,Comfortable Hands-down one of the more comfortable shirts i've purchased from retailer.
0,"Length is far too short I ordered an xxs and it is extremely short in length. another customer had a similar review, but i still took a chance that it would fit well. the sides of the shirt have slits, and because the shirt is too short, it shows the skin on my hips. the rest of the shirt fit fairly well, but i'll still need to return this top."
1,"Pretty, comfortable, functional Feels great, flows nicely, and love the pockets that hide pretty much everything from a lipstick container to a phone."
0,"Cute colors, cute tee I was really looking forward to these tees working, after reading the reviews. unfortunately, they had slits on the sides that came up higher than i was comfortable showing my sides just above my jeans. trying to keep it age appropriate."
1,"Love these! When i spotted these online i knew i had to try them out! in the past charlie pants have always been too baggy in the legs for me when trying the regular sizes on in the store. well, these are described as 'slim, tailored' in details, so decided to order my usual size 6 regular. upon arrival, they were baggy in the thigh area, the rise was fine but the crotch area -pardon me- was a little on the short side. buttons were difficult to slip into the buttonhole & unbuttoning was a job! guess the hol"
1,"Pretty and unique Always get compliments when i wear these pants (my mom has the exact same pants and loves them too). they are great for work and transitioning to go out after. i like my pants tight, but these run a little small."
1,"Casual, cute, easy Excellent dress. usually i wear a oop, and this did fit great. a little snug in the chest (im a 32c), but the buttons are covered by material so it doesnt show. the waist hits perfectly. there is the right amount of skirt material to make a dramatic silhouette without looking silly. awesome dress! wish the blue or white with icecream were still available! the hot pink is a wonderful summer color though."
1,"Pretty and casual top I got this i n regular xs (i am xsp or xxsp), so it fit fine considering is boxy. it is very cute and delicate so despite being casual, it gives a nice ""dress-up"" kick to any jeans, shorts, capris. im very happy with this top and like it very much and definitely recommend it to everybody. just be careful since is delicate
:-)"
1," This dress is very versatile. it is comfortable and very flattering. the armholes were not too big. you do need to wear a bra that crosses in the back if you do not want the straps to show. i purchased the red/pink color and it is very vibrant and not see through at all. the length is great as it is above the knee by a few inches, it accentuates the best part of the leg. it also can be dressed up with heels and jewelry or more casual with flatter shoes. it is a classic style, not trendy so it wi"
1," I love my blue dress, i'm a pear shape to the top fit fine on me. i know reviewers complained that the top was too tight, not so on me. it was also not sheer on me because it has a cotton lining underneath. got a lot of compliments!"
1," I ordered this dress in raspberry, the color is beautiful in person. i am usually a petite size 2, and it fits perfectly. the only thing about this dress that might drive me crazy is that it seems to wrinkle easily. other than that, i think it's a great dress for summer!"
0,"Cute, bad fit! I so wanted to love this jumpsuit but unfortunately the fit is so off. it runs small and the crotch is to high. the color is beautiful and the design is great. it's really sad i waited two months for this and it was definitely not worth the wait."
0,"Nice fit but there are issues I am 5'2"" and i typically wear a 2 or a 2p. lately i've been finding that petite is just a little too short to wear with wedges so i often order a 2 as i did in this dress. it fits well and it's flattering. my two complaints are that it gets wrinkly fast and looks sloppy. yes, linen is a wrinkly look and that's normal for linen but somehow this dress just looks sloppy to me. more importantly, while wearing for the first time, i realized that the seams on the side were very lightly sewn and there"
0,"Sizing is off I have to agree that the fit is unfortunate. i am using a size 2 in retailer and most dresses. i knew to size up based on reviews here. i tried the size 4 and i could barely button the top. the waist fit fine and the underarms was fitted nicely to the body. i sized up to a size 6 and the dress was oversized in the top, with gaping armholes. too bad because the color is beautiful and the style is adorable."
0,"Pretty but sizing and cut is way off Runs small. i'm usually a size sm for retailer clothing (for reference, i'm 5'4, 129lbs, 36b). the tie around the waist of this dress is not a functional tie that you can relax a bit to give yourself more room around the waist. i could not fasten the buttons to close the dress on the size 8. the size 10 fit enough to fasten the buttons but there was a lot of extra fabric and the arm holes were very large. pretty, vibrant colors but size up and be warned of the large armholes."
1,"Flattering, but odd feeling This shirt is thin and probably not worth full price, but it was flattering to my figure. covered my post baby tummy and complimented/minimized my g size chest, but the cut was off. the seams for the arms were almost in the front at the chest, so when i moved my arms i had limited movement forward and it pushed the embroidered panel out and was just irritating. an entire day of readjusting my shirt would drive me crazy. i tried the m and the l."
1,"Great design, unfortunate zipper I loved the jumpsuit the moment i saw it in the catalogue and luckily there was one returned to the store near me! i am 5'10"" and 140 pounds. the small fit perfectly, but the zipper on the top section was so difficult to use that i would need help every morning to get dressed. the zipper was missing a couple prongs and i had to make the return."
1,Perfection This top looks great and feels great. got lots of compliments when i wore it for thanksgiving. i pretty plan to wear this for every holiday event this year and will layer it with sweaters and scarves to mix it up.
1,"Better in person; size up This is a really adorable top!normally i shop online, but ended up in a store today. i bought it instantly, but never would have purchased this based upon the pictures. as all the other reviewers have said, this does run small and you need to size up, especially if you are busty for your size. i am a 4 or a small  (34c) in just about everything, but had to go to a medium. the sleeves attach too far out on the front of the top, restricting arm movement. thankfully, i didn't see a significant size"
1,"Size up This dress is everything i imagined it would be. lightweight, flattering on my hourglass shape, and comfortable. i am a true 4p in retailer dresses (5'4"" 32d, 27 inch waist, 28 denim size) and purchased this dress in a 6 regular. i imagine the petite size would be way too short, as the regular size hit about 3 inches above my knee. might be a problem for taller girls. definitely size up on this one to avoid button gaping."
1,"Too boxy This top has a really pretty pattern and is good quality, but was just too boxy for me. i also felt like the sleeves were a little odd/big. 

the fit is tts, though slightly shorter then it looks on the model."
1,"Classic Love this top.
the fit is perfection!
the fabric is wonderfully soft.
i ordered the green, love this color.
will be ordering it in the grey also..
fits very true to size."
0,"Darling but disappointing I bought this sweater the minute i saw it, and waited for over six weeks for it to come off of back order (it was further delayed from even what i was told when i first ordered it). 
i was beyond excited when it finally arrived and wore the sweater the day after i received it... i had a long flight and thought it was the perfect option for keeping comfy on a plane. 
i was so disappointed that by the time i got off my flight four hours later, the sweater had not one, not two, but three differen"
1,"Tight in the chest I'm 5'2 and based on some other reviews i opted for the regular rather than petite and am glad i did. even the regular is kind of short. if i raise my arm(s) all the way up, skin is typically exposed. i originally ordered a medium and i liked the fit everywhere except for the chest. i'm a 34dd and i felt like i couldn't move my arms. i exchanged it for a large to sacrifice some of the fit for some more arm movement. the cut is already a bit boxy so having it a bit boxier with more arm movement w"
1, Gorgeous colors and great shape for a mini dress. stunning on. the only con is how low the back goes. a bra alone underneath is not possible. will need to wear with a finer shirt underneath.
1,"So cute, but tricky fit This top is adorable and looked pretty on, but when i raised my arms the top wanted to rise up and then stay there above the breast level. it didn't settle back into place when i lowered my arms. maybe a larger size would have helped, but then it would have been a boxy fit. i also found it hard to take off, even with the button on the back of the neckline. the length is cropped, so you would want to wear it with a high-waisted skirt or pants. i like the details in the fabric a lot, but i didn't"
0,Almost perfect I wanted to love this dress because the fit is so flattering and the color is so great however i could not get the button along my bust to lay flat. normally this can happen if the fit is too tight around the bust but i promise there was still plenty of room. the fabric just bent in a way that left a gaping hole at my bust. unfortunately it's going to have to go back.
0,"Runs small This top is beautiful in the model shot, but average in person. it ran really small, i usually take a medium in retailer tops and ordered this in a medium. it barely fit over my chest, and was pretty short (i am 5'7""). also, the material is very thin, not so much that you can see your undergarment, but if you get cold everyone will know it. also, for the price, i expected a sturdier fabric. i would recommend holding out for sale, if you are interested in this top."
1,"Darling well made dress After reading the reviews, i was a little afraid of the fit before the dress arrived, having ordered it online. it is a darling dress. i am big busted (36d) and it fit just fine. also, it has an cute attached slip, so i didn't find it see through. the color is gorgeous, i chose the blue, and it will be perfect for summer. no problem at all with the armholes!"
1,"Very pretty and comfortable A very beautiful, flattering, and breathable/comfortable mock neck turtleneck that's great for layering. for those unfamiliar with weston, this top - like many of their others - is essentially made of panty hose nylon. it makes for a super comfy and stretchy top, albeit a delicate one. be mindful with your hair accessories and jewelery when wearing this!

1,Perfect cover-up This cover-up is perfect for the beach or the pool. it is see through.
0,"Unusually poor design by hd in paris Normally, hd in paris brand is spot on for their dresses. this dress is a big thumbs down. as most of these reviewer's and myself point out, the large arm holes do not allow you to wear a regular bra because you don't just get a peak of your bra, you get to see the whole side of it. secondly, the bust of the dress would work only for an a-cup bra, too small for the average woman. the only bright spot with this dress is the brilliant colors available and the quality of the fabric itself - excelle"
1,"So charming! This dress fulfills a gap in my wardrobe that i've long wanted to fill: that of the perfect springtime dress. i got the sky blue color in a size 4 (for reference, i am 120 lbs and 34-26-37) and it fits like a glove. the color is vivid and the overall effect of the dress is simple and romantic. i'll be wearing it with casual cognac sandals, a floppy straw hat, and minimal makeup."
1,"Perfect summer dress I wore this dress to an outdoor farm wedding and it was perfect. it runs small (i'm 5'5"" 125lbs with 34c bust) and i got a size 6. i tried on blue and pink, both were great but the blue won me over. it wrinkles easily so i had to use an iron on low to medium beforehand. will wear many more times!"
0,"Armholes too big, gap This dress is lovely fabric, generaly nicely tailored, but weirdly large around armholes, which gap. i'm sending it back. also this 'red' is more like a fuschia.
 dress was generally a a bit too big on top, oddly both too long in the torso, and the shoulders cut too far in--they didn't cover bra straps--as well as unattractively large armholes. you can even see it on the model. i i'm a size 10 to 12, fairly busty but not extremely, and with a slightly short torso, which is party the problem (th"
1,"Short wasted and fun Fyi the neck does have a hook and eye closure so there is room to get it on and off. the fabric is not stretchy. the lining is a nice navy. however, the sleeves are not lined. the cut outs have a beautiful blue lace behind it. it hit me at my waist. i'm 5' 3"" , 118#. i loved this top. worked with a pair of the new essential skinny trouser by retailer, and the nansen pointelle cardigan in yellow. this also paired well with a pair of rust colored skinny pilcro with a long necklace."
1,"Xs fits like 00p First off, i adore this jumpsuit.  i love the mixed stripes and i love that the fabric is structured, textured and substantial.  and for me, the xs fits perfectly, however the sizing is way off from standard sizing. i'm 5'2"", 110, 24.5 waist, 32.5 hips, and usually 00p-0p, and this is fitted on me.  the wide legs aren't too wide like most wide legs (which wear me instead of vice versa) and the structure of the fabric make this piece so flattering for petite ladies.  if you are petite, this jumps"
1,Super cute! I had bought the pull over in the same fabric and now this zipper jacket style. so fun and love the texture. i waited for markdown plus promo and it was worth waiting.
1,"Perfect little classic summer dress Tried this on just for fun today and ended up taking it home in the glorious blue. many have commented on the sizing issue. for reference i am 5'5, 120 lbs, 32a, slender athletic build. i bought a size 2 and it fits like a dream. no large arm holes, no gaping buttons  and the length is perfect. yes it will wrinkle, it's linen. that's part of the look. i feel this will fill a void in my closet that was missing. i was wearing flat ankle wrap espadrilles when i tried it on and it looked super cute."
1,Lauzet t-shirt dress Very comfy dress that you can wear in the summer if it's not too hot and in the fall/winter with boots (tall or ankle).
0,"Adorable but runs small I agree with others that this top runs small. i am usually a 2/4 in retailer tops and the small was very tight around the chest area. however, it looked so cute on! i wanted to buy it so badly, but it just didn't work for me. the design is absolutely adorable but i could not lift my arms without the whole top riding up. they did not have a medium in the store so i couldn't see if a larger size would work. overall, such a cute top, just not appropriate for someone my age or practical for someone ch"

pros:
- great breathable fabric.
- cute look overall.
- sash in front brings it all together.
- buttons are hidden under a panel of fabric, which is a nice touch.

1,"Beautiful but not quite right I was very excited to get this piece, but it wasn't quite right for me. very well constructed and nice material, but the open sides were a bit too open toward the front. the top zipper was tough to do on your own."
0,Loved the color and fabric but fit was not great I really loved this dress in the store when i tried it on the color and fabric were perfect for summer but once i got this home i noticed the placket wouldn't lay flat across the bust like shown in pictures. when i went up a size it was too large under the arms so this one will sadly have to go back to the store.
1," Adorable top! sweet but not too sweet, can go either casual or dressy depending on what it is paired with. i was looking for cropped tops as that silhouette works better for my proportions with the plethora of cropped bottoms that are in stores. as another reviewer mentioned, it is lined so no cami is necessary. the label says dry clean only however, i have washed it in a mesh bag on gentle in cold water and hung to dry without any issues. the dry cleaning warning may be because of the lace on t"
0,"Not what i had hoped for On a positive note the dress was very well made, great quality as usual from retailer. however. this dress looked like a sack, i believe it may have been the combination of the drab color and the sack like shape. very plain and unflattering. for reference i am 5 5 140lbs 34c ...so i do have a shape it just did nothing for me. it had to go back."
1,"Runs small and short waisted Thick material and cute design. i am typically a size 2 and the small in this fit but was snug in the crotch and just zipped at the waist there is not much if any stretch. i am 5'6"" with a 26 1/2 in waist so that was unexpected. it does have cinchers at the waits but they are more for aesthetics than functionality. it is a very cute design and the fabric is nice as well as the direction of the stripes."
1,"Perfect summer coverup I have to be honest, i wear this away from the pool more than to the pool. it is extremely lightweight and comfortable, making it the perfect loungewear to tackle this california heat, and the style is fabulous- love the hassles and beads on the ties."
1,"Loved! Great fit, easy to dress up or down, lovely shade of blue--this will be my default dress this summer."
1,"Beautiful surpise backless sweater Always looking for sweaters that are wearable in south florida, stumbled upon this gem. from the front gorgeous silvery gray, soft sweater and stunning open back with romantic silky black bow details. bows will hide bra easily underneath. so comfortable, classy and sexy."
1,"Perfect in theory, good in reality I needed this dress as soon as i saw it on a mannequin in the store. unfortunately, when i tried on my usual size (4 regular), the armholes were so big that you'd be able to see my bra no matter what. i purchased a 4 petite online later that day. it fits perfectly! i received so many compliments on this dress. a few issues though: (1) this dress wrinkles like crazy. i know it's linen, but i looked like a mess after wearing it for just a few hours. definitely don't wear it to work and expect to l"
0,"Not exactly as pictured I received this dress in the mail yesterday. right away, i noticed the coloring wasn't quite the same as it appears in the images online. in person, the hints of brown appear more bronzy and shiny, as opposed to more muted. i was willing to look past that, but then i tried it on. i ordered a small, which is my typical size in retailer dresses. it ran quite large and was way to long for me (i am 5' 4''). overall, between the coloring and sizing, this dress wasn't a hit for me."
1, My friend and i bought the same dress we love it so much we get so many compliments great purchase
1,"So so lovely! I have had my little eye on this dress since it came out! lucky me i found it sitting pretty in my local retailer lost   found! it runs a tad big, when i first tried it on with the sleeves off-the-shoulder i was disappointed in the length (past my knees); but i tried it on again with the sleeves sitting on my shoulders ... so so darling"
1, This is a beautiful blue color and a fun swing design. it is very short so will be limited with what you can wear it with. looks very cute with higher waisted jeans and pencil skirts. it is wide but has a lovely flow/swing to it. love the fabric and it is a nice change to everyday style in wardrobe. so if you want something fun and flirty and feminine and you do not mind short this is your top.
1," The reviews i read scared me a little about this top being super cropped. it is on the short side, but will be adorable with shorts and pants that aren't low cut. the multi-textured fabric is gorgeous!"
1,"Great pants that go with everything I purchased these pants on-line in my usual size petite 4 and they were a perfect fit for me. i have a 27"" waist, 35"" hips and i'm 5'4"" and found them to be a little long but not so much that i want to hem them as i'll be wearing these with my clogs and platforms anyway. if i want to be able to wear them with flats, i'll need to hem them but i bought them to go with my higher shoes so it's no bother. these are very slimming pants and zip up at the back. they are a tad difficult to zip up but not"
1,"Absolutely beautiful, great quality I bought this for an event, and when it arrived, i realized it was probably too dressy for my event. there are some large sparkly clusters of ""stones"" that are beautiful, but do make the dress more cocktail attire than i needed. if i had something to wear it to, i would keep it in a heartbeat. the fit is flattering and the quality is reminiscent of old school retailer pieces. there are cups already in the bodice, which is a huge plus imo. it's unique and beautiful!"
1,"It's still too short.... I was so pumped to see a slightly different version of last years, military swing shirtdress, because i loved the idea of it, but it was just was too voluminous and short for me... well, this year, i ordered a size up, remembering that last years dress ran right in the chest and shoulders. i guessed right! this time, in a size up, i had breathing room and was much more comfortable. this dress is also a lot less billowy. there is sting definitely a swing but a much less dramatic version! my issue"
0,"Beautiful design; but, disappointing quality It's a beautiful lace designed tank top in a vibrant navy blue; however, the lace on the hemlines were snagged.  the top was much shorter than i had anticipated.  i'm returning it to the store, unfortunately."
0,"Bof. (aka meh) As the other reviewer said, this top is pretty short. nice design but i wish it was a little longer, and i am short... i tried on xxs regular, xs petite and xs regular.

xxs was closest to flattering around the top part (shoulders, cehst), but stil la bit short. the petite was jsut too short and xs regular, a bit longer, but a little loose... os hte fit jsut ddind't work. i may wait for sale on this, but probably something beter wil lcome along.

great for those who want to show their assets"
1,"Wide and comfy Fabric is the nice comfortable hh fabric they have been using to make dresses and shirts. it wrinkles a little though. also feel ""heavy"" though not too warm. i like the collar not being a fold over. teh dress wasn't too short on me (00p) in front, and does go longer in the back (high low) - not an issue for me. i ordered the navy

i decided not to keep it only because i don't really need it and they make a similar version every year. but if you don't have it yet, good to have.

i am 115 lbs,"
1,"Lovely dress This is dress is great for an occasion - such as a wedding.

i wanted to keep this dress for such occasion - but there were 2 drawbacks. i ordered the dress online and when i opened the package, there it had some sort of oil/petroleum based product smell. the other drawback is the hips - it just flared out more than i wanted. i think that a belt would have solved that, but i usually don't find belts in my size.

as for the fit, it is true to size. i'm a true petite and the 00p fit great!"
1,"Pretty This is a full swing top. because the top is so full, it should hit at or slightly above the waist (and it does on me) so that a pant or skirt waistline can be seen and balance out the proportions. will look great with a pencil skirt or any pant that as a mid or high rise fitted waist and flat front (no pleats or draw string, for example). the fabric has weight and hangs nicely. color is true to photos. easy way to look a little dressier during summer. 5'3"" 120lb 34b - small regular fit me perfe"
1,"Nod to mod I love the weight of this dress, the mod color blocking, the pockets, the detail down the side of the skirt, the cable knit, everything! i wear it with a caramel cardigan and brown booties, it's perfect. it's a sin to pass it up, especially for this price."
1,"Classy Maeve once again created another beauty! love, love, love. i purchased the crocheted cape in cream and have received numerous compliments on the dress. get it while it lasts! i typically wear a 4-6 in maeve and got the 6 in this one."
1,Cuter than i expected I didn't really pay this dress much attention online or even in store. an associate suggested i try it on. it's so much cuter on than it appears online. the button detail is great and i love the pockets. it does bunch up a little but not too bad. i tried on my normal size 2 or 4 and the 4 fit me perfectly. it was a tad long and maybe the petite will be better. i have fairly sensitive skin and the wool pieces were a bit itchy so i had to take it back. but if you aren't sensitive then this is for
0,"Lovely...not on me I saw this dress worn on the street and thought it was lovely, the perfect work dress. i then found it in the store and my size was already sold out, so i visited another retailer, and another to find it. unfortunately the color blocking on the chest was not very flattering for me, it seemed to overly accentuate it. i am 5'9"" a 36 dd size 12.
the colors, the fabric are all wonderful. but this dress is not for me."
1,"Paris runway dress! I have a closet full of dresses and very few have the quality and attention to detail as this gorgeous dress!
often times when ordering online the dress that you actually receive will have a different fabric placement than the online photos.......and it can detract from the overall look.....but the one that i received is exactly as pictured. the gold details hit in all the right places.
the quality is shocking! looks like a $2000 dress.
true to size however, the chest/bust runs a little big."
1,"You need to try this one on! From the online pics, i would never think to try this on, but i was looking for a shirtdress with pockets, so glad i did! i purchased in green and navy... i love the neck line when buttoned up, almost military jacket'ish and i like the idea of wearing over jeans and a shirt and leaving unbuttoned almost like a light layer or jacket. super soft material... i purchased a size 6 and i am 5'9 and 140 lbs."
0,"Love the design, hate the itchiness! My title perfectly describes my attitude toward this sweater. the print is super cute and the price point is great, but this sweater was so itchy that i couldn't even keep it on for longer than a minute. it may be okay with a long sleeve underneath, but don't even think about wearing it by itself!"
0, Unless you have the body of the model - tall and very thin and wear a really small size - don't even think about getting this dress! it's literally a heavy sack. it hit right above my knee in the front and basically mid-calf in the back. the material is nice but it's an awful shape!
1,"So much to like This dress will take you through fall, winter and spring. i love all the stitching and design detail. it has a nice swingy skirt that is quite a bit longer in the back."
1,"Cute, but... I loved the dog on this sweater, and i rushed into the store to buy it. once i tried it on, like others, i did find it to be itchy, but that i could deal with using a tank or something. what bothered me the most was the way the arms were cut. my arms looked much bigger than they are, so sadly i left it at the store. it really is a cute sweater though..."
1,Very flattering fit I love this top. the design is beautiful and the fit is flattering. it's so pretty. the top has great movement and pairs well with so many things. the top hits somewhere around my waist but wasn't too short. i highly recommend this top.
0,"Very unflattering! Given that i am petite with thighs (take a size 6p or 28p) these were not for me! the run small, are really tight from the thigh up, run longer that a petite should and are fairly thin. on top of that the zipper and hook in the back are really inconvenient. i was looking for something i could wear to work, and these were not the right style for that. plus they seemed cheaply made, like they wouldn't stand the test of time. i imagine if you are tall and skinny like the model, they would look good"
1,Has pockets I love this dress! it has pockets in front. timeless. fun. dress up or down.
0,"More of an a-line than straight There were no reviews when i purchased this dress. from the picture with the model, the dress looks to be a straight shift dress. i received mine yesterday and the dress flairs out and isn't straight. it is also pretty large. i ordered a medium as the smalls were sold out and i'm not sure i will keep it. still on the fence. dress is shorter than pictured as well. sleeves are shorter than shown. now, after having seen the dress and looking at the online picture, i think the model is holding her a"
1,Perfect fall/winter Material is heavy enough to provide warmth on a crisp day or evening.  add poncho or large warm scarf to keep colder temps @ bay. sure wish this came in blk. i bought mauve & just love it!
1,"Wardrobe staple I'm 5'10"", 140lbs and this dress fits exactly like shown on the model. hits right above my knees in front and an inch or so below my knees in the back. i didn't find it to be too blousey at all. i'm more pear shaped so i like that this is flowey around my hips and bum. purchased a size 6 and it fits well over my chest and arms. if you're busty or have muscular arms i can see how this might feel more restrictive. great staple to my wardrobe!"
1,"Unique design I really wanted to like this sweater. it was featured in the dressing room and i am a sucker for animal prints. the dog print is unique, a ""mossy"" fuzzy print, and the grey really shows off the dog print. i like regular xs because i like the fitted look (i am 5ft2in, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), the hem falls at my upper hip and the sleeves fall a bit pass my wrists. but, if you do not wear a turtleneck under it, you will scratch all day long. the designer should try on the fabric before selling it!"
0,"Too itchy I was excited to order this sweater. when it arrived, the green didn't stand out as much as the picture here. it also felt too itchy. i usually wear either very soft wool or wool with cashmere because i can't stand plain thick heavy wool. this one was just too itchy for me, it is going back."
1, Awesome flares and very flattering! a wardrobe staple!
0,"For long slender legs I ordered a six 6 petite. the pant leg was still very long. and if i have it tailored it will not preserve the whole point of these pants having a flare. this is a slim fit. i have heavy thighs and this was not for me. i'm 5' 120 lbs. also the tag warns that the fabric may leave color on lighter clothing. which i don't get, because it's spandex blend. also wasn't too hip in the zipper on the back."
0,"Really, really bad Okay, so this top has its redeeming qualities, i promise! which is why i gave it 3 stars when i really wanted to give it two. but it's just not worth 2 because i'm sure it works for some people and the quality is just impeccable. for people who purchase this, it will last forever. it's sturdy cotton, not thin like many retailer tee materials. the lace detail and texture is on point and the neckline is very nice. it's a great looking top. my issue though, wasn't with the bust as other reviewers hav"
1,"Perfect for wedding season I just scored this dress the other day and i don't regret it for a second. the bodice is beaded with some sea-foam green beads and they are sewn on really well, so i am not worried about dropping them all night. from the pictures, i couldn't tell if this was going to look like a cotton skirt or i fit would be chiffon looking-it is neither. it has a shimmer to it which makes this a more dressy looking dress than i was originally anticipating-i thought it was going to be an everyday wear type of d"
1,"Cute style This is a really cute style of t-sihrt. i totally disagree with the reviewers who thought this was too short in the torso and/or overwhelming. i'm 5'8"" and about 145 pounds and this fits just fine. (i ordered a size small.) beautiful drape and (i thought) relatively slim cut. the only reason i'm not giving this 5 stars across the board is that the fabric is a little too thin (not sheer or see-through, but not as substantial as i would expect for the price."
1,My new favorite top! This is my new favorite top! it's so comfortable and looks great. i wish i could order it in more colors!
1,"The perfect summer tee! I love this top! its so comfortable and light weight! it drapes beautifully, with an overall loose fit but a little slimmer at the bottom. so flattering! i only wish i bought them in every color before they ran out!"
1,"Different than pictured I really wanted to like this top, just got it in mail today, but unfortunately it did not work well for me because i'm 6 ft tall and the blouse was too short. i like the look and how it feels and i haven't completely decided whether to return it, but here are the issues i have encountered with this top. the blouse is very pretty and has a nice refreshing style with good print and color, very soft too, unusual for rayon of this type, feels more like thin delicate cotton. i got my top in red, size"
1,"Runs small I loved this top when i first saw it. i tried on my usual size l, and there is no stretch through the bust, so it totally flattened my chest. a few weeks ago i noticed there were some xl's that must have been returned. i tried them on and they fit perfectly! i suggest sizing up if you have a chest, this is a very flattering top and it looks great paired with scarves as a wrap, skinny jeans and boots."
1,"Fun embellishment! Now this is a summer staple! love the design of the bib of this tee. super soft, great neutral charcoal color and can be dressed up or down. it is loose, i'd recommend sizing down."
1, Got this shirt in black so i can wear it to work.  more personality than a plain t-shirt but still comfortable.  got lots of compliments.
1,"Perfect button down Button down shirts usually aren't my thing, but the soft fabric of this top makes it feminine and comfortable while still keeping that classic look. it's also easy to dress up or down, which is great! i am 5'4"" and small-framed, and the size 0 fits just right."
1,"Great top This top is super comfy and easy to wear. i found it to be a bit darker tan than it looks online, but still quite cute. it's flowy but still gives you shape, overall it was a great buy."
1,"Darling I ordered the ""london, paris, milan"" print red top in a size 4. i go back and forth with ordering 2's and 4's but i figured that with long sleeves, i'd rather have a little room than it be fitted. my boyfriend asked if i bought it for valentine's day- the red print and the cities struck him as romantic. anyway, lovely top. lightweight material will be nice for layering during winter, and wearing on it's own in spring and next fall."
1," The perfect tee. this is exactly what i have been looking for. flattering fit,looks great dressed up or down and has just a touch of unique detail without being over the top, the top is just slightly thin but can definitely be worn without a cami underneath. this reminds me of old retailer tops from several years ago that i just loved and wore to death."
1,"Beautiful basic for mild fall weather Unfortunately, i am not toned enough to truly show off this beautiful blouse. armholes are cut in a bit too far for my 60 year old arms. was hoping for a pop of color as a basic sleeveless top to layer under sweaters and jackets for traveling, but the neckline wasn't layering as i had hoped. i am only 5'2"" but want a bit more length.
i think this blouse is best worn uncovered as shown, on a toned body that does not require the longer length i prefer. seems to be well made, sadly i must return."
1,"Loved it The photo doesn't do it justice. the detail on the neckline is adorable and looks fantastic with jeans. texture is light and gauze-y, but i don't find it too see-though. sizing was tough- i'm 5'10 but thin on top- usually between xs & s, and went with the xs on this (ordered both to try), sacrificing some length for a more flattering width. great for the sale price!!!"
0,"Looks like maternity wear First, it's huge. i'm not big busted but it's so roomy that i looked like i was pregnant. not exactly what i was going for. nice color and soft fabric but would only work if you plan to tuck it in--and i'm short waisted so no tucking for me. back it went."
0,"Not that great This top is on the boxy side but the design is cute and i love the pink color. the problem i had with this shirt is the huge arm holes. one side you could see the top of my bra, the other side was below the side of my bra. you could also see the inside back of the shirt through this arm hole, it was that big. this went back, will not re-order. i usually order xs or xsp, this was an xsp."
1,Great for all shapes This is a great blouse for all shapes!   you can wear it under a suit or with jeans!
1,"Soft versatile=heaven Super soft and super chic! this sweater wrap looks great at the mall, at church, and even just curling up with a hot drink on a cold day at home. i'm still in love with this after a year!"
0,"Terrible fit This blouse was so cute, i really wanted to love it. as others mentioned, there is something wrong with the fit. i'm not a large person, but the top was tight even though i ordered a medium and a small."
1,"A good, all purpose summer shirt True to size, and adorable. very lightweight, will be great for the long, hot summer ahead!"
1,"Maybe i have a long torso I wanted to love this shirt. i like the style, the material is soft but it was so short on me. perhaps i just have a long torso but it fit everywhere else. i wasn't even able to tuck it in because the sides just were so short."
1,"Little overwhelming on me I had high hopes for this cool top. i ordered it in xxs because no petites were available at the time, and i think the size is just right (i'm +/- 105 lbs, 34aa). i just suspect it looks better on people with broad shoulders, like the models'; mine are kind of narrow. plus, crew necks aren't the most flattering neckline on me. i would say it's fairly short, just barely covering my belt, so on taller people it may be cropped, and the waist is kind of fitted, as shown. i love that it's cotton, mad"
0, Received this product with a gaping hole in it. very disappointed in the quality and the quality control at the warehouse
0,"Top has a broad neckline. I liked this top (in black), but it didn't fit me well. had to return."
1,Fun work shirt I wear a lot of solid dark colors for work so i liked this was dark blue but had more pop than the basic navy. able to pay it up with other colors too. the sides are a little shorter so have to watch throughout the day so belly isn't showing. not a bid deal overall.
0, So unflattering! really disappointed. made me look 6 month pregnant and i'm a petite size 2.
1,"Nice blouse Got this on sale, in three colors! love the look of the blouses, great for work. only con is that the sides are shorter than i would like."
1,Versatile and pretty I love this top!  it does run big and maybe some won't like it with the elastic waist.  i think it's the perfect weight and very comfortable.  i love the detail around the neck line.
1,Lovely fabric Soft fabric and hangs nicely. washes well. purchased in the orange /red and love with jeans.
1,"Tts! thin fabric! just ok! Lost some extra weight, and decided to venture into styling territory i haven't tried in years. bubble hems will never flatter my thick midsection, but the drawstring with tassel ties make the hemline easily adjustable.

size: i'm currently between a small, and xs. the armholes appeared to be on the small side, so i ordered a small. i'm 5'5"" tall, ~130 lbs, 34d, 35-29-37, long torso and narrow across the shoulders. 

fit: the top is tts. the length hits slightly above hips. i didn't need to"
0,"Something's wrong I really loved this top. however, i couldn't get it on. i tried on a medium (my usual size.) it's not that it was too small. something else is wrong with it. the large was way too big. too bad, i really wanted this look."
0,"Horrible fit This shirt looked cute until i tried it on... worst fit ever. im thin, and this style of top is usually quite flattering, but this one missed the mark big time."
1,"Great button down, runs small I purchased this in the red & love the fabric and overall design of the top. i have returned it for a larger size. it is very small through the chest. hopefully, a larger size will give me more room though the chest without being too large in the rest of the shirt. i'm a 34 c and ordered a size 6 for reference."
1,"No stretch I love this top! the color is quite unique (a reddish color), but the cut really makes it stand out. i love the square neckline. i feel it accentuates my bust without showing too must breast. i notice a number of other reviewers had an issue with the tightness around the bust: this top looks like it would have ample stretch in the photograph; however, in person you can see that the embroidered area does not have any stretch. for me, this was not an issue, as the top suited my body type well rega"
1,"Black and white is navy? I love this top and find it flattering, but the black and white polka-dotted motif that i purchased definitely has navy blue in it -- not black. kind of disappointing that the color description was so inaccurate."
1, Very very cute. bought in store yesterday. put it on today to wear and it is huge. i normally buy a large in tshirts. i will return for either a small or medium but will try on in the store. oh well.
0," This top was too big for me. 5'4, 135lbs and ordered xxs. fit was fine and wanted it too work, but too overwhelming on me as well. will be going back."
1,"Perfect beachside sweater This is not your traditional moth sweater, in that, it is not soft and cozy. this sweater is great for upcoming summer nights at the beach while fireside or out on the boat! i haven't been the biggest fan of the lace up trend but this one is more traditional nautical feeling than others which i did like. it's pretty true to size, so i wouldnt size up or down for any reason. they paired it with a cloth + stone white button down underneath at our store and it looks great layered too!"
1,"Very comfortable and cute This shirt is very comfortable to wear, mostly because the buttons are well placed. many button down shirts bother me because they gape open at the bust area, but the buttons on this one are placed at just the right spot."
1," Fabric is soft,cool and comfortable. love the sleeves as air circulates. this is perfect for new wide legs i purchased. many compliments and purchase inquiry when worn. purchased in two colors."
1,Lovely top Love the detailing around the neck of this top looks great under cardigan or by itself. i sized down to an xs. seems to be of good quality although to lengthen its life i don't plan on putting it in the dryer :)
0,"Nothing special I thought this would look great with skirts, but all my skirts are too dressy for this t-shirt. that's really all it is -- a nothing-special t-shirt. and it runs so big! i'm usually a large or xl in tops, but for this one i bought a medium, and it's still too big. i think a small would have been fine. but, as i mentioned, it doesn't go with any of my skirts, so it's not worth looking for a small."
0,"One size is too big, the other too small! I didn't know what to put for ""runs small, true to size, or runs large,"" but it required me to put something...i first ordered the xl, and it was ridiculously gianormous. the next time, i ordered a large. i thought the large would either be a perfect fit or still too large, based on how the xl had fit. the large was too tight! i could not believe it! it is too bad, for i love the design and color of this top! i ordered it in the muted red color. if you can find a size that works for you, go for"
1," Bought this size small and orange. needed something to where home, beautiful, comfortable, light and airy, paired it with retailer's manella stack pendant necklace, even better. received alot of compliments, the color stood out."
1,"Great piece! I love this blouse! i get so many compliments when i wear it. i can't wait for warmer weather to pair it with my coral short skirt from retailer. currently, i wear it with a pair of slim cream colored pants, and flats. it works great! it is a little on the short side, but it just adds to the tailored look of the cut. however, if you're taller than 5'5"" or 5'6"", i would expect it to be much shorter on you (you've been warned ;)
overall, this is a great addition to your wardrobe, and it washes nicel"
1,"Perfect top for going out or work I bought this top for work and going out.  it is a beautiful top that goes with many items in my closet like my red blazer, grey blazer, red cardigan etc.  it is very flattering.  the arm holes weren't too big.  fit tts."
0,"00 petite is way too short on the sides I ordered the black & white, 00 petite. i'm 5' 2"", 96 lbs. and i order petite sizes all the time. the length for the size i ordered is about 23"" (on the back, from neckline) which is great for me; however, the length on the sides is way too short. the distance between the armpit on the blouse and the side hem is only 9.25"", so my skin shows on the sides all the time when wearing regular jeans. not at all the way it shows on the model. i would order 00, regular length, but then the sleeves will b"
1,"Poor quality I loved the look of this top the moment i saw it in the store, particularly the muted red color. the crochet detail is very pretty and i found the fit to be quite flattering on me. however, part of the crochet detail on the one i received has a hole that needs to be repaired. since i purchased during the sale, i'm going to try and mend myself, but this may end up having to go back. if you see this in store and find one that is not damaged, i would recommend it!"
0,Odd fit I wanted to love this sweater but the fit is just awkward. it is very short and box and ends up being very short in the back. i am going to return this item.
1,"So soft! and blue-er in person I wasnt expecting this top to be so soft and comfortable and breezy! i am usually an xs petite, but based on reviews i got the regular small. it is a little loose, but the length is perfect. i am short for reference (5'2, 107 lb, 32c). the buttons gaped a very tiny bit, like a centimeter, but not to the point where any skin or bra was visible. had i got the xsp, i think the gaping would have been an issue. the arms are too baggy for my taste (length is ok though), but i fold the sleeves up at th"
1,Love it Great top. i got the size 4 but i ordered a 6 and plan to return the 4 depending on how the 6 fits. the top is really cute but it fits just right and i would like a little more room. when i raise my hands the entire shirt raises up. otherwise cannot wait to wear it and this is a great purchase.
1,"Gorgeous red shirt!! I love this shirt so much i bought it (nearly) full price with my birthday month discount!

feels heavenly and polished and fun at the same time. i bought the medium am generally
a medium."

1,"Silk blouse This blouse is exactly what i wanted and the fit is great. silk is always light, and can go with jeans or dress up with a skirt. i'm wearing mine to a baby shower in a few weeks."
1," So beautiful! fabric hangs great, lovely detail, fits well and feels great"
1,"Nice top I bought this top in slate. it is very nice, looks so flattering and good with a light pant. it runs large though and is loose fitting, like a swing top. i like the design at the top. i will try the mauve in the store. i really like this top and recommend it for casual wear. very comfortable and soft."
1,"Closet staple Cute, basic top. it has really great detail at the top and it is a good length (it is not super long/too short). it does billow out a bit at the bottom, so i would size down (this is what i did after reading the previous reviews). i do not think i would have paid full price for this top, but on sale, it is a great deal and a nice addition to your wardrobe."
1,"Invites compliments These pants are adorable. i am a petite lady with a small waist and have a hard time finding pants that fit and look good, but these do. they are both cute and elegant. and they have pockets. i have had many compliments. the one drawback is they need dry cleaning."
0,"Good quality - poor design Quality jumpsuit but poor design. the green made me look a bit like ""gumby the cartoon character"""
1,"Happy addition to fall wardrobe This dress us high quality and feels great, however i am 5'5"" and it is too long for me. will definitely need to shorten but love it, not above knee as pictured for a non supermodel!"
1,Live in these I could live in these. they are so comfy. i typically wear a 6 and got the medium. they are a little roomy. probably could have gotten a small..but i like them kinda loose and baggy. i will probably purchase another color!
1,Love it This body suit is super flattering and super comfortable. i'll probably order it in the other color.
1,Prettier in person I love this! the contrast in much prettier in person.
1,"Cool for the summer I was skeptical about buying a romper. i was also unsure what size would fit me (i'm 5'5"" and 150 lbs.)  to my delight, the romper fit perfectly! it's a gorgeous and flattering fit.  i love the design and fabric!  it's stunning!"
1,"So comfy Bought the tan/taupe joggers today in asheville. so soft and comfy, will probably go back for navy ones. i found them true to size. will be a great, cute addition to my summer wardrobe."
1,"Great fit I have these pants in the blue/grey color and like them so much i got them in olive. wash well, fit perfectly... easy to throw on and look great!!"
0,"Way too big and bulky The quality of the garment is high--a nice substantial yarn and a pretty crochet pattern, but the cut was totally off for me. i'm usually an xs/s, and was swimming in the xs. the arms in particular were huge and drapey, and the whole thing just hung on me (for reference, i'm 5'4"", 120 lbs)."
1,"Pretty tee I purchased the blue and it's a wonderful deep blueish purple. i like the chiffon detail which makes it a bit more stylish than a normal tee. fits nicely, a bit big but not enough to go down a size. the material is not sheer and a nice light weight."
1," The shirt can be a little boxy, so make sure to order your size! the peplum is a great length in the back."
1,Go to shirt for this busy mom I am always looking for a shirt that's a little different yet as comfortable as a normal t-shirt (running after a 1 year old i need comfort). i bought two colors and love the vibrant pink/salmon and the dark purple (which i think it said was blue for some reason). the material is nice and the cut is feminine.
1,"Cute and comfy I love this shirt. i ordered a large because i am taller, and i wanted the length to be right. while it's a little baggy, it's still very flattering and i've received lots of compliments on it. the color is exactly what is show in the image. it's a versatile shirt; depending on what you pair it with it can be appropriate for work, dinner, or a night out. i'd definitely recommend this shirt to a friend."
1,"Nice basic Nice basic pencil skirt to have in the closet. i think the fit is right on and did not have any problems with billowing like in the other review. quality is nice, but could be even better."
0,"By the end of the day these jeans shimmy down =( Bummer, i fell in absolute love with these gems until i realized how weak the stretch is by the end of the day. i purchased them on the 13th of feb and can't bare to wear them anymore."
1,Size down ladies! This is a very unique piece. it seems to be easy to wear and it is very comfy. but i normally wear a medium/size 8 and it was too big. i might size down to a petite medium of just go for small. it seems this might be a trial and error type of outfit.
1, Free and easy but the fabric seems cheap.
0,"Hospital white lace on top of taupe sweatshirt The fit of the top is true to size, but i really don't like the taupe terrycloth-like sweatshirt under the white lace. the white lace is bright white and seems very sturdy, but it makes the sweatshirt underneath look very dirty and very noticeably taupe. it is terrible paired together. i also didn't like the feel of the terrycloth-like fabric against my skin. even though this is a good quality piece with a lot of interesting detail, i'm absolutely sending it back."
0,"Silhouette not as great as pictured The straight-leg silhouette is ruined for me by the immediate bulge beneath the elastic waistband, mostly caused by the pockets. their openings protrude out right below the waistband. it's not flattering and while the trousers are not too tight for my hips, they give the impression of extra hips. if not for that silhouette issue, i would keep the trousers, as they are comfortable and pretty, and unlike my other trouser options. not see-through, as i feared."
1,"Great piece for layering The melon color is soft and flattering. it is a little on the long side in the back, but i paired it with a lightweight, flowy sweater, and received compliments."
1,"Runs small I'm 5'7"", 125 lbs and i ordered these in a size small. i just got them in the mail and the print is really pretty and they seem very well-made. unfortunately, they were a little too small, particularly around my butt. after i ordered them, i read reviews on other merchants' websites and saw that many other stores recommend sizing up, as the brand is known to run small. i wish i had known before i ordered, but i'm exchanging them for a medium and i hope those fit better, because this suit is ador"
1,"Fantastic This dress is an absolute attention getter. it's incredibly unique, and fits beautifully. i'm very short, and often have problems pulling off this much pattern, but this dress was just right."
0,"Soooo cute, but short rise. I saw this at the store today. very excited about it but i had no idea how to get it on! there is a side zipper so i attempted to step into the jumper through the collar but could never get my arms through! from what i could see on my body, it would have been too short in the crotch. i decided not to fight with it to put on entirely. i gave up. cute shade of green though."
0,"Pretty, yet boxy While this top is pretty, it's very unflattering. it just looks so boxy on me that it makes me look heavier. too bad, because i really wanted to like it."
0," Oh dear. the elastic waistband just ruined this skirt for me--it made it look so cheap. i assumed from the photograph that the skirt was a knit over a structured lining with a real waistband with a zip. instead, it's a sweatshirt knit with no lining and elastic. it looked cheap and hung a bit baggy from the elastic waist, making it a no-go for me."
0,This top looks amazing on the model- not me I wanted to love this shirt. the fit was a little off and i wish it had come in a little at the waist to be more figure flattering before it flared out. the fabric is nice but wrinkles easily and in the white is see through.. sadly i will be returning.
1,Dressed up dressed down Love this dressed up casual tshirt. perfect casual friday shirt or going out for happy hour with the girls.
0,"Didn't work for me They look nice on the page, but they didn't work on my body. made me look big and boxy. maybe if you're super-skinny, they'll be fine."
0,L space estella hipsters The fit on these is frustrating. with l space you almost have to try everything on first because the sizing is different from one cut to the other. i wear a 25/26 jean and a medium in this bottom still felt and looked too small.
1,Great buy! Super flattering and lovely material. dress-up or down. they run true to size.
1,"Truly worth every penny! I was lucky to get these on sale with free shipping(my major lucky shopping moment of the year); however, they are worth every penny of the full price. i've waited years before shelling out this much for a pair of nice jeans, but now my skeptical opinion has done a 180 turn. these paige verdugo ultra skinny jeans are superior to any denim i've ever tried. they look and feel fabulous on me. i bought my usual 29/size 6 and am 5'1"", 130#."
1,"Runs very small These pants run small by two sizes or so. nice material, color true to picture."
0,"Not great quality :( I loved these pants - super soft and cozy and perfect for winter. i've worn them a handful of times and have washed them maybe twice max and they already have 2 holes! they don't say handwash and my washer/dryer is brand new and pretty gentle on my clothes. maybe i just ended up with a bad pair, but i found the quality to be disappointing :("
1,"Great casual staple Saw on my way out of the store and had to try them on. they are very comfortable and surprisingly cute. the jogger style usually doesn't flatter my curvier body but these have a drape to the fabric that made them look so much nicer. i took in two sizes, my usual small and a medium since i just had my second child and still have some post baby weight. i still went with the small after trying on both though. the medium was a bit too big and shapeless. the small was comfortable and looked better. t"
1,Best linen pants Today i happened to walk into my favorite store with an already reduced 30percent off sale sign. i tried on this pants and let me tell you-wow!! they are super comfy and made my behind look great!! i will definitely start wearing these asap!!
1,"Cute, but... These pants are cute. they seem, to me, to have a wider leg than appears on the model. they do run big, so i would recommend sizing down if in doubt. these are cute pants that can be dressed up or down, but unfortunately, look pretty sloppy by the end of the day, as they stretch and wrinkle very quickly. since they already run a bit big, this is a major negative. i wore them to church, and they were quite wrinkled by time i got home. by late afternoon, they looked like a different pair of pants."
1,"Long I tried on the blue in store and ordered the red in petite, and they are both too long (which means i will have to hem). i am not sure if i want to spend the extra money on hemming so hanging on to them for now as i love hte cut and color. they fit like a glove otherwise (i do have muscular thighs). the 0p is good for me (115 lbs). can't go wrong for a nice pant, i can see wearing these out or for work..."
1,"Pretty but scratchy The color of this is beautiful. i'm 5'8"" and had to order the s because they were out of the m, so it's not as dramatically long on me as on the model, but otherwise fit - sleeves a little shorter too. the m would have been better. but it is a little scratchy wherever it touches my skin, so it's not worth the $$$ to me. going back :("
1,"Not got us curvy girls I really like these pants - great color and design. they are even lined! unfortunately, they do not work on my curvy frame - all the usual problems: waist too large, hips too small. sadly, i am taking them back."
0,"I'm not there yet This was about to be my first retailer splurge item, but i think i'm not there yet. for the rich price tag, these pants weren't going to be versatile enough for me. they're very light weight and even translucent in sunlight. perfect for a small subset of my days but not going to make the cut for casual friday. that light patch near the r knee is also a pocket- tended to flap open and look about as nonsensical as it is. if you're already on this level good for you! i had to send these back."
1,"Beautiful color (red/orange) and drape! Very long, so may need to hem if your inseam is under ~34"". beautiful trousers!"
1,Ok pants They were ok pants but too small. the texture and shape were not what i expected either.
1," Velvet always has made quality clothing and i had purchased the same shirt in another color and i wanted to see if they had other colors, they did and i got 2 more. i received in expected time and they were wrapped nicely. thank you for great choices of unique clothing."
0,"Runs very small Ordered the biggest size available, the large. the arms are so tight, i couldn't get it on. looked like it may have fit in the body so i don't understand why so constricting in the arms. i don't have big arms, either. fabric is thin but the color is pretty. can't recommend. i'd pass on this one."
1,"Great tunic! I was looking for something to wear on jeans fridays. this tunic is super cute and looks great with jeggings. i did find the sizing small for me, but i am busty."
0,Truly beautiful! This jacket is high quality leather and will bring you years of wear! i made sure to add a little room to accommodate thick sweaters!
1,"Very impressed! Received this jacket today and i am so very impressed with the details. initially when i ordered this jacket i first thought the navy blue waffle fabric was a corduroy or velvet, but it is a plain cotton blended fabric with unfinished edges that has the denim attached to it. the plus is the inside breast pocket that is trimmed so nicely and lined, and fits a nice sized phone. the inside is lined and even the sleeves are lined . there is pretty cream lace trim on the inside bottom of the lining i"
1,"Perfect so far... These pants are very cute for spring/summer, and i enjoy having the option of a looser silhouette with a bit of length (nearly all of my pants are a cropped skinny these days!). i agree with the other reviews that have described the leg as being less straight-legged than they are pictured. on me, they have a subtle flare -- nothing major, but just enough to break perfectly over my shoe. they fit tts on me, but i did need to have the hem taken up. i'm 100 lbs, 5'0 and the 0p fits perfectly. i hav"
1,"Such an easy dress to wear! Bought this dress to wear for my engagement brunch! it does run big, but it's a laid back dress to wear?i never had to adjust the dress of myself while wearing it."
1,Beautiful pattern Beautiful dress! flowers and material look even better in person. loose fit.
1,"Exquisite print makes the dress even more fabulous First, let me say that the photo does not do this exquisite print justice! the fabric is worth framing! on a white ground, the tones of rose, pink, purple and touches of blue make it even more fabulous! the fit is a tad large, as i am 5' 3"" and usually an size 6, but must size up to 8 or m because of my chest. even zipped, it is a tad big, but nothing that i cannot deal with. i don't really see the swing in the dress, as it does not flare out in any way, but is certainly is loose and flowing, bu"
1," Like other reviewers, found leg more flared/straight than pictured. i wore all day at work (desk job) and didn't see any wrinkling."
1,"Great, comfortable pants The pants were true to size in the waist but they were a touch long for my 5'5"" 120 lbs frame (i got a size 0). they did stretch out a little during the day (i wore them about 10 hours), but not nearly as much as the other reviews led me to believe. however, they were a little loose on my legs when i first put them on, which i liked."
1,"Love these pants I bought these pants on a whim while i was at my local retailer. i was so delighted after trying them on because i've never tried on a pair of linen pants that i actually liked. they definitely have more of a flair leg rather than straight leg like the picture suggests. i wore them for several hours at a party and they didn't stretch that much on me. i agree with the other review in that they do get a little wrinkly but not much more than what i would expect from linen fabric. i'm 5'3"" so t"
1,"On trend These jeans fit pretty well on my petite frame, although wish they were more cropped. for reference i am 5'4"" 110 lbs. i was looking for frayed jeans for this fall and these jeans are on trend. i may look at petite options which would be truly cropped. overall they are very stretchy skinny jeans and have a nice dark wash."
0,"Ugly design So i bought this, even after seeing the other reviews. because i love the designer and their things are normally cute and different. this fits just as others describe. it was not flattering to me at all, 5""2. had to go back."
1,"Great for around the house! I understand what the previous reviewer meant when she says these are great for around the house. the yarn is thick but the weave is open so they are nicely springy but not very warm.

they look perfect with my birkenstocks so i'm getting then in all colors."
1," Very cute and comfortable!does run big, i used the size chart and it's very generous-would order down a size next time."
1,"The taupe is to die for I immediately picked out this in the taupe color at the store. the black was pretty basic looking, but this color is gorgeous. it's quite flowy on me (i wear an xs/s most places but usually small in tops here) the sleeves stretched out a bit after a day of teaching too. one of my favorite tops at retailer right now!"
1,"Snow bunny coat! This jacket is amazing! i at first bought the medium because that is what i usually wear on top. when it arrived in the mail i put it on asap. it fit but was definitely too form fitting to wear a sweater or long sleeve shirt underneath. so i called the store and asked them to reserve a large and that one fit perfectly! it's loose enough to wear something underneath but not so loose that it looks to big. it is so soft and cozy, and the hood is my favorite part!"
0,"Overpriced, even on sale I purchased the blue s (140lbs, 5'8"", 34b) and this was very large and boxy on me. not altogether unflattering but not so flattering that it justifies the price. the blue color is very pretty in person--darker and slightly marled. however, although this sweater is certainly cashmere (and very soft because of it), it is very thin--to the point that i consider this a ""top"" rather than a ""sweater."" the silk panel in back is pretty but, again, thin and unlined. i think that, even on sale, this is ov"
1,This is better in person I tossed this in my bag (online) at the last minute thinking i'd give it a shot. so glad i did. this is dress is so simple and so much more flattering then i expected. you can dress it up or down. i wish it was about 1/2 inch longer but still a good length for me (things are always too short for me). the material could be a little thicker but then i suppose it would lose the bounce that is so key to the flow of thing with this dress.
1,"Best pants ever I love these pants! super comfy - fit well and a great color. i knew immediately when i put them on that i would love them. and the button fly? to die for. 
wore them and they did stretch out a bit by the end of the day but they didn't look awful and super baggy. i bought the other color in a size smaller so they might be better. a great pant for summer!"
0,"Give it a pass Pretty shirt on the hanger, but there's a goof in the design. when i tried it on my 3d self, there became this weird ruffle right beside/below the bust that you can barely see in the right of the photo, now that i know it's there. the tulip nature of the shirt is pretty in concept, but where the top layer starts makes the fabric stick out right by your bust and it's not flattering, and i'm just a 34 b."
1,"No support = lots of side boob This suit is so beautiful, and the quality is great. i wanted it to work out, but unfortunately my chest size is not compatible with this bathing suit. i am a 36c and there is zero support (which i assumed when i ordered it, but it was so lovely in the photo i had to give it a try). for those who have a smaller bust, or are more comfortable with a little sexy side profile, this may be perfect. i ordered the large, and the bottoms were a good fit. i am also very petite and the length was good one"
1,"Great crops Just got these and love them. the blue color is a great bright shade without being too crazy and they fit well. i'm 5'7"" 138# straight build and ordered 27 (true to size for me.) they have loosened up throughout the day and the waist and hips are a bit baggy now but i like that they're not ultra-tight. nice light fabric for the summer."
1,"Nice basic with details This sweater feels good and not itchy at all. i'm long waisted and the small hit right at my hip bone/top of my low-waisted jeans, so it's kinda on the shorter side. i liked it that way, bc it's not baggy at the bottom and is figure flattering. i tied the tie twice and thought it looked better. i have long arms and was excited the sleeves go down to the middle of my hands. it has little hole detailing down the middle, but not so much that you'd have to wear a shirt underneath."
1,Love! I love these socks! they are super thick and comfy. the quality feels great and they were cheap!
1,"Great for around the house but nothing else These are just some classic ""around the house"" type socks. they're not comfortable enough to wear with some boots or anything. just super snuggly and soft for lounging purposes only. i love them and am contemplating buying the other pair. i got the blue and white ones to go with the farrier tee in blue and white. i'm kind of bummed that i can't wear these anywhere but no worries. they'll be great with some joggers and a sweatshirt while i work the crossword over a cup of coffee. would recommend"
1,"So cozy These jeans are super cozy!  the material is so soft, they feel like i'm wearing yoga pants. the color has a little more depth than in the photo, not just straight navy as it appears. my only issue is because they are so soft, they lose a little shape after worn all day. love mother jeans!"
1,Great design and comfort This is s very comfortable cami with comfortable and nicely designed straps in back.
1, This socks are very comfortable however they do feel a little big around the top so for people with a small lower calf might find them a bit big. that being said they are very comfortable.
1,"Boho brilliance for below freezing temperatures If you're like me and wish you could carry on downtown boho dressing when the time to take out your puffer comes to pass, this tunic is essential. though the silky alpaca-wool knit is thicker than gauzy cotton, it drapes just as well and keeps one's self warm and cozy without the bulk of a sweater. i was concerned with the elastic banding at the bottom of the tunic because i'm only 5'4"", but high-waisted, and banded hems tends to always hit me at the wrong spot. luckily, it's not very binding, s"
1,"Beautiful, elegant and soooo soft I can't stop rubbing the faux fur. faux fur can be cheap and tacky but this looks and feels beautiful. it has two hook and eyes and comes with a third which i used to add another hook on top, above my bust. its roomy so size down if you want it fitted. i'm 5'1"" and 120 with a 34 c bust and a short torso and i got a small. i could have worn the xs but i like the fact that the small allows for a good weight cashmere sweater underneath without feeling tight. the hood is the best part. it's so drama"
1,Best jeans!!!! This was my first mother denim purchase and i've already gotten another color. love the feel of this denim. it's heavy enough to smooth out any imperfections and manages to stay tight (not stretch out) while being comfortable. this color is perfect too. so flattering. love!!
1," Simple, classic, figure flattering, and reasonably priced!"
0,"Costume material I ordered a small from the online shop knowing it would be drapey, but it's much more than drapey. and the front draping looks like halloween costume material - not chic or sophisticated. sadly, i will be returning this top."
0,Poor quality Dress is much different in person. thin ribbed cotton.  a little tight for xl.    it looks like a throw back dress from contempos.  returned and would not recommend
1,"Cool for every figure This is a great top, not cheap but funky! it would look nice on any figure. the two blacks on my top are more alike than the picture shows. great value for a pretty party top - but it can go anywhere!"
1,"Comfy, flattering and beautiful! Love this top! it is almost universally flattering, and washes beautifully. it is as easy as throwing on a sweatshirt with leggings, but soooo much better! if you are on the fence on this one, i highly recommend you give it a try."
1,"Everyone needs a little blue pants I love everything about these pants- the color, the fit, the detail. oh, and these have a button fly. i didn't realize that when i ordered them, but i love it. i haven't had a pair of button fly pants in so long. these have a nice stretch to them as well. hei hei knows what they're doing. and i got them on sale. thank you retailer!!"
1,"Beyond lovely This actually might be my favorite thing that i have ever owned.  the jacket is so beautiful and so cozy jacket. i agree that the pics do not do this amazing piece justice.  for reference, i am 5'7 140 lbs and bought the large to allow a bit of room for layering."
1,Amazing soft jacket This jacket is so adorable on! i have no idea why retailer styled it with a chunky cream turtleneck under it considering the jacket is also cream and it's hard to tell what it even looks like?! i've been searching for a coat like this to give my leather jacket a break. in my opinion a lot of the faux coats look like they have cheap itchy material. this definitely does not! it is super soft and the faux fur is of high quality. the inside is also lined and feels like a very thick soft jersey sweater
1," I tried this shirt on in store, and loved it! it has a flattering fit and is very comfortable. i read some other reviews about the quality not being good, i don't feel that way at all. the knit and the silky/satiny materials both feel like quality to me. the one concern i have is that it may wrinkle easily. i'm 5'4'' and 125lbs and the xs fits well. i plan to pair it with skinny jeans."
1,Cute and comfortable Very comfortable to sleep in. doesn't bunch up or twist. love this.
0,"Good idea, poor execution This tunic is a perfect length for leggings. the mauve color got rave reviews on my first wearing. and the mixed media and asymmetrical styling gave the garment a unique appeal and made it quite flattering. however, when i wore it a second time, i noticed two micro holes in the sleeve. one near my wrist and the other at the shoulder. since i take extreme care when laundering my clothes, it seems this will have to be a return as the jersey knit is not strong enough to hold up in the delicate cycl"

1,Amazing coat/jacket Have kept my eyes out for a jacket like this for several years now. and this one is more than i had hoped for.  in the store i was between a l and m.  so went with the large.  after getting home and trying on a couple more times i decided to order the petite large.  jacket is roomy warm and so so soft.  added bonus w the hood.

I tried this top on today because i was really hoping i could get the shorts and robe set. the shirt was softer than i was expecting, but when i tried it on it was an uncomfortable fit. there was some tightness in the armpit area, which is not where i would have expected it to be tight. the rest of it was comfortable and reasonable looseness so i don't think a size up would have been a good option for me. i like the design a lot so i was really disappointed it didn't fit. it is between a lightwe"

1," How has nobody reviewed these pants yet?! love them! they're more like really nice, structured leggings, but thick enough to be substantial pants. they're stretchy, hold their shape, flattering on my big hips and thighs, and have no distracting elements like belt loops or protruding pockets like some of my other pants, which makes it hard to keep a smooth silhouette under a longer shirt. the only bad--and it wasn't even really that bad--is that these are longer than the 27"" advertised. i'm 5'5"","

Well, i totally disagree with the previous reviewer on this one! i think this top is very pretty. yes, it does hide any flaws in the tummy, but it is not wide nor does it make you look pregnant (side or front view). i am 5 ft, 2 inches, broad shouldered, 36c and the small fit nicely (i usually wear a small to medium in retailer tops). i am thinking of purchasing the xs as there is still plenty of room around the chest/arm area. the lace is pretty, looks good worn with a dark colored pant. the only"

0,"Dry clean only in casual top. no way! Tried this on in the ""onsie"" area of retailer store. i usually am between a medium and a large. the medium fit fine. the material in this top is substantial - very thick and soft but it is very thick as a warning. more for a pretty cool spring evening vs the heat of the summer in chicago. not sure how much the material would stretch out either. as it seems like it could be the type. also, it is dry clean only, and on such a casual top, that is a real deal killer for me.

it gives me that extra edge of authenticity & encouragement to do the most w/what has"
1,"Great holiday dress! I highly recommend this dress!!!!!! i was a little nervous about purchasing this dress online because previous reviewers were saying that it creates static, but nothing that a little static guard couldn't prevent! :) i purchased a medium petite and i am about 5 feet tall, usually a size 8 in dresses and it fit perfect! (wore for thanksgiving) the fabric and style are very forgiving and the dress sort of flows with you when you walk, which i love!!"
0,"Too wide, too short This jacket was too wide and the length in the arms too short. i wear a medium in almost any article of clothing and felt like i was swimming in a short little jacket. the ratio of how wide it is to the length is not for me but might work well with other body types. the arms were definitely too short."
1,"Great, easy to wear jacket I was so pleasantly surprised when i received this in the mail, because it's much more substantial than i thought it would be. it's perfect for fall and spring and the lining is very soft. i thought it'd be more difficult to wear but it goes well with everything! i ordered my usual size small and am happy with the fit."
0,"Looks great on the photo but was too big for me I wanted this jacket to fit on me like in the photo, but i guess my frame was still to petite. the fabric was also on the cheap end"
1,"Perfect dress! This dress is very flattering on and can easily be dressed up or down. i was nervous it might be too flowy, but it lays very nice and is so pretty on!"
0,"Beautiful design, poor quality I almost bought this skirt yesterday in store, but decided against it because the fabric was subpar. the skirt i tried on was snagged and unraveled. i selected another skirt, which i purchased. as the sales associate was folding the skirt, i noticed that this one was also snagged and unraveling. despite loving the style and fit, i had to be realistic with my lifestyle and decided to return it then and there. if there were two severe snags on two skirts before even leaving the store, how would th"
1,Checkerboard sleep top I only say that this sleep top runs small because it shrinks a whole size after you wash it. i'd recommend that you order up a size for that reason. otherwise it is cute. i am ordering the shorts to go with it.
0,"Had high hopes & really wanted to love it, but... It just didn't work for me. i don't know if it is my fair complexion and untanned legs, but this dress was a strike out. the orange floral design and beading is beautiful and the fitting i would say is pretty tts. for reference, i am 5'7"" and 145lbs with 36"" 30"" 40"" measurements and i purchased a medium. the chest and arms were not too tight like other reviews stated. the length is about the length in the picture and a lot of fabric to make it very flowy. overall, very good quality and beautiful"
1,"So cute and stylish!! Was in my local retailer today and just had to try this on! it appeared to be a structured jacket, but it is actually a sweater-jacket! gives a very ""chanel"" vibe and looks so chic. i plan on wearing it with just about everything. i would probably wear it open most times, but i love the closure with the button detail. i am large busted, but petite, 119 lbs., 5'2"", and this was way more flattering on me than most jackets. normally, the sleeves are too long, but these were just right! i am sure i wi"
1,"Awesome jacket/blazer I own the green version of this jacket and ordered the ivory as well because of the sale price and because i loved the green one so much. i highly recommend this jacket to wear over dresses, with jeans or skirts all year round!"
1,"Simple and clean Lightweight and casual, i picked this jacket up on sale. i usually don't like sale items aggressively priced- there is usually a reason why it was a difficult sell to begin with, but this was a pleasant surprise- as in no surprise! picture depicts color and material well. great throw-on for running errands. clean lines, nice simple detail. only thing that is slightly annoying is that the off-center zipper makes the wider side flap over when not zipped, but this is true with almost any top cut th"
1,"Cropped jacket I ordered this to go over a dress. i wanted the jacket short, to not cover the waist of the dress. on sale, i think it is a great bargain. the sleeves are long on me, but i rolled them, which i thought was intended since they are lined. the medium fit me. i am usually an 8 in tops. the ivory color is almost a pure white."
1,"Perfect jacket I love my new blazer! the material is very soft and comfortable, and very nice quality, but not too ""wooly"" to wear into spring. the cut is very flattering, and the patterns and fringe details are very eye-catching. i am 5'6"" and usually wear a size s in retailer and this small fit perfectly. they grey/cream color combo is gorgeous and looks very versatile, and can be dressed up or down.

the one alteration i suggest is moving the button; at the shoulder it gives a wide boxy shape. my tailor wil"
1," I wear size 8 , ordered a medium, fits great. nice quality, like that you can wear open or buttoned at the shoulder."
0,Lampshade If you like to wear lampshades this is the shirt for you. beyond unflattering. boxy and seriously looks like lace was stitched to the bottom of a lampshade
0,"Hugs in the wrong places I was very excited to receive these pants and wished they had worked out as the fabric is structured and yet comfortable. however, while stretchy they looked very tight on the thigh and yet were too big in the waist. i will acknowledge i'm a runner with somewhat muscular legs, but was hopeful these pants wouldn't cling to them. for reference, i'm 125 lbs and usually wear a size 25-26 in pants."
1,Terrific turtleneck tanktop This shirt is super comfortable and super chic. it looks great and feels great.
1,"Amazing find! I can?t describe my love for this sweater! simple, to go outfit paired with jeans and boots, it?s an easy go-to sweater in a pinch on a cold day. i have sensitive skin, so i wore a tank underneath and was fine. loved getting this sweater with the extra 40% sale price! i purchased the medium (2) and it was tts."
1,"Love I absolutely love this pullover and am so glad i purchased it. it is the perfect weight for fall/winter, super soft, true to size. the diamond shape opening in back looks great with my strappy yoga bras, i have received compliments every time i wear it. i am 6', 144lb, slim/athletic build and often have trouble with sleeve length. this however is perfect & i can use the thumb holes as designed without stretching the sleeves in an awkward way. wish it came in more colors!"
1,Love! So great! soft and a great sweater but still gives you a shape to your body.
1,"Very comfy, cute, light top! This is the perfect top. it is adorable, and the fit and cut of it is forgiving."
1,"Extremely delicate top I so wanted to buy this top - especially during the 30% off tops sale this past weekend - so it would have been just about $100.  but while it was well made, i could see it easily snagging or getting caught on jewelry.    if it was on sale even more, i might have considered it.  it could be extremely versatile, with jeans, black skinny pants or leggings.  really loved it, but couldn't see spending that much money on it."
0,"Too fitted at bottom Perhaps i have gotten too used to flowy shirts, or the cut of this was not right for me, but it felt too fitted around the rear end and the shoulders didn't lay right on me. sizing up would have only made it too big in the shoulders so i returned. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame and ordered a size small."
1,"Love this! Although it was a bit of a battle with my bra straps, it was completely worth it for date night. hot shirt! very comfy and quality fabric. next time, i may just pin or tape my straps..."
1,"I like it enough But runs large. i tried on the regular 0 in the store and it was very pretty but baggy. would definitely need a tank if i were to wear this to work. lace is romantic and i do like the button details. i would give it a try but for me i will take my chance and wait for sale if it makes it there in my sie. i need 00. petite already gone sadly. 

reference 115 lbs 30dd and 26.5 on waist."
1,"Torn I ordered the xxs p, but the actual cardigan is a xs p.  i was bummed as the xxs p are sold out. well, it fits ok anyway. (115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist)
beautiful sweater but oh so itchy. i think wool should be listed first (like ingredients) it is really itchy. why i so torn. i want to keep it because it is nice, but it is itchy. i will have to try it with a long sleeve shirt underneath, i don't think i can hang with ah short sleeve or sleeveless. colors and pattern are warm neutral, not red."
0,"Shorter than pictured, sheds a lot I ordered this in size xl. the ivory was as pictured. the lace details were well-done. but, the length was much shorter than on the model. i'm 5 ft. 5 1/2 in. for reference. even the sleeves were on the short side, above my wrists. the main problem is how much it shed. just in trying it on, there was fuzz everywhere so i returned it. i love when retailer mixes lace into the knit of sweaters. this one just didn't work out."
1,"Love this top I have received so many compliments on this top from both men and women. it is so comfortable and cute, i never want to take it off. :p"
1,"Beautiful but itchy and tends to run. This sweater has beautiful colors & cute fur collar which can removed (nice).  i bought it impulsively.  when home i tried it on with a tee as sweater is warm. i had to take it off immediately as it is scratchy & itchy.  i could not wear this without a long sleeve tee underneath, but i would be too warm.  in the store, several sweaters had thread runs in them and from the weight of the sweater.  given the itchiness and potential to run, i am returning the sweater."
0,"Stuck! I was so excited when i ordered this, i love comfy clothing this looked perfect! when i received it, there was a weird smell with the top. convinced that this could be from storage or something, i washed it. the smell did not go away. i have washed it 3 times now and the smell will not disappear! i have not yet worn but as i have washed it, not able to return it. the top looks and feels great - just the weird smell. now i am 'stuck'!!"
1,Love it!! I purchased this in the red (really more of a brick color) and wore it so much that i went back to get it in black too! i received a ton of compliments when i wore it! the fabric is a nice weight and it hangs beaufully. looks great over skinny jeans or leggings. i plan on wearing it year round!!
1,"Simple & structured I love this tank. i got it in the turquoise and just ordered the blue. this tank is indeed linen and does not wrinkle. it's fitted without being too tight. i have a somewhat shorter torso and narrow waist and athletic build and this looks great! i'm not a fan of flowy tops in general so thrilled to find this easy, casual piece. i ordered an xs but am usually either xs or s in retailer."
0,"Cropped and boxy It is a beautiful sweater, but it is cropped and boxy."
1,Comfy Love this top! red color is a bit orangey for my taste but overall a fabulous piece.
1,Great top So glad i purchased this top! it has great style and can be matched with just about everything. the material is very soft and it seems really durable.
1,Great shirt but runs large This is a nice shirt and very flattering. the ivory is actually more of a tan/brown- i would not call it ivory or off white. the material has a nice texture to it as well. it does run big and long so keep that in mind when purchasing.
1,"So flattering! I love these cozy, fashionable leggings. they are super flattering and thick enough to wear to yoga or out and about in the real world. i will definitely be getting another pair! they seem true to size. i am tall (5'11) and usually wear a lg."
0,Stiff and itchy Loved the look of this sweater online. was disappointed when i took it out of the package i was surprised at how stiff and itchy it was. i ordered my usual medium and though at first they shipped the wrong size it was small all over.  it felt cheep definelty not worth the high price. knew it was definitely going back
1,"Great, comfortable jeans I love these jeans. they're incredibly soft, super comfortable and hold their shape. i can wear them for hours on end and i don't get that droopy, snagging look jeans can get when they stretch out. 
 

fit: i am normally a 29/30 depending on the jean. i took these in the 30 - i usually have a difficult time finding skinny jeans that fit my legs and don't fall off my waist. these have enough give to accommodate my larger legs, but the material holds well, so i don't need a belt to keep them up"
0,Pretty top but too delicate The top is gorgeous and bohemian like with a loose fit. the top arrived with a small black stain and some of the lace already ripped. it might be too delicate for me to even exchange for another and wear. i am going to have to return it.
1,Great versatile piece! I bought this tunic for my mom as a birthday gift. it is very good quality and will look cute for fall too.
1,"Definitely size up If your looking for a nice quality basic tee, this is it. nothing special, but the fabric is a nice soft cotton with a little stretch. the cut is long and lean so i would highly recommend sizing up. i sized up from my usual medium to a large and it's still quite form fitting. i'm 5'2"", 35a/b bust, 28 waist, 39 hips."
1,"Siamese cat pattern For cat lovers in particular, these socks will grab your attention. they are fine quality ankle socks. the kittens are really more moss green than beige."
1,"Lovelove! Retailer has done it again! i love this top. i purchased it for our engagement photos. i am typically a small or medium, and decided to size down for this one. i purchased a small and it fit perfectly! its not near as long as it is in the photo, which pleased me. i did read about busty ladies having a problem with the fit - and i can definitely see how that would be an issue."
1,"A little boxy I love this tunic, the detail the weight, the fringe. but it runs big. i would have done better to have ordered one size smaller. i think it would have looked more tailored if i had gotten the medium."
1,"Slouchy soft tee with one problem.... I ordered these in both colors. the red is much deeper in person, more like a burgundy than pictured here. these tees are very slouchy. if you wanted a more fitted look, size down. these are very soft and very comfy and will pair well with ponte leggings and skinny jeans. the overall quality seems very good, although they are thinner than i thought they would be (they seemed like they would be thick and stiff to me based on the photos).
----------
overall these are very nice. but there is one is"
1,"Better than it looks on the model This top was surprisingly very flattering. it hugged my curves in just the right way and the slits on the side are a nice touch. i'm 5'2"" and about a 34c and the xs was tight (in a good way) around my chest and then more flowy after. soft material and the red color is beautiful!"
0,"Still not sure about this After seeing the picture online, i was coveting this top for a while and then retailer days happened! i immediately ordered it, but i'm still not sure if i'm going to keep it. i ordered a 2p (0p was sold out) and i was assuming it was going to be a little big, but i like flowy. the sleeves and chest are perfect but the top is cut so generously in the back (and it's a bit longer in the back as well) i feel like it looks like i'm wearing a wedding dress. i love it from the front. i'm going to try to"
1,"As pictured I ordered the red and am watching for my size in the green to come back into stock. i was already expecting my bra straps to be exposed, not a big deal as with shoulder length hair it covers them so i found this top to be exactly as pictured/described. it fits like it looks on the model and i thought the color to be spot on. i have washed it once in the washer on cold and dried only for a few minutes on low as i like to do with delicate knits to regain shape and i think it looks as good as it di"
1,"Falll in love Fell in love with this sweater the minute i saw it. the crocheted front is stunning. the small fit perfectly, 5'5"", 36c. i am usually between a small and medium so if a small is usually roomy you may want to size down. it's a medium weight, soft and comfortable, not at all itchy. perfect for dressing up or down. look forward to many years of use from this fun, classic style cardigan."
1," This sweater is beautiful! not only is the lace front gorgeous, but it is incredibly comfortable and so well crafted. definitely my favorite cardigan now."
1,"Cool sweater This sweater is really pretty in person, and well-made. every time i wear it someone stops what they are doing to compliment it; one person asked if it was home-made( in a good way) i will admit that i would not have paid full price and did get it on sale, and in that case it's worth it. the sweater does have an unusual cut. the waist is boxy and the back is a bit shorter, but somehow it works. for me i see it as a cool style and not a mistake. it's super warm and i love it."
1,"Fun and gorgeous This is a really elegant sweater coat--the faux fur trim adds a lot of flair and the ""mismatching"" color blocks on each side keeps things playful. the material is soft and cozy, but my one concern is that the threads can get snagged. otherwise, though, it's a winner!"
1,"Nice slimming look Love this top. makes me look slimmer, comfortable as well"
1,"Warm weather winter This top is perfect for wanting that fall/winter look in warmer climates. the slits on the sides allow for a lot of movement and turtleneck is just right. i love wearing it with my paige bell canyon flairs and some clogs! my only thing i wish was that it was cut in so much at the top, as how you can see at the model's armpit, wish that part was a little wider it would be a bit more flattering. otherwise great top, i have it in black and been thinking about getting it in the orange color too!"
1, Soft and stretchy denim. beautiful color. i do wish they had a tiny bit higher rise but they fit like my other paige skinnies.
0,"Very large; lace is kinda coarse Thought i'd love this top; i'm a sucker for lace anything from retailer.  but i found the lace, while pretty, to be quite rough, which to me indicates a lower quality. and i guess i should've known that it would be very swingy (photos show that) but it really overwhelmed me.  for reference, 5'5"", 125 lbs, 34d. sad, but this went back."
0,"Cute but chunky While i love the design, this sweater even in the small is too over-sized for me and was unflattering. it was returned."
1,"Great for casual work wardrobe I work with children and have a casual dress environment, this top gives me much needed style to my work wardrobe."
0, Super large and a very weird cut.  the sides were much shorter than the front and back and this just looked awful on me.
1,"A nice transition top I tried this top in the store and i really like it. i am 5'2"", 34b with wide shoulder, tried on my usual size s in both colors and they both fit fine. however, i found that the ivory one fits a little bit loser compared to the blue one (by the way, the blue looked more like dark grey in person). the length of the ivory one seems to be a little bit longer than the blue one as well. since it is a drapery top, i like it to be roomy, so i purchased the loser/longer ivory one. it looks great with a j"
1,"Perfect fall sweater I adore this sweater!  is it a bit itchy? yes.  do i care?  certainly not enough to send it back. great length, hangs nicely. unique without being gaudy. great purchase."
1,Love Finally got cold enough to wear this shirt. i love it...got lots and lots of compliments. great quality
0,Not comfortable because of itchy tags 3 tags - one quite huge (about 2'' by 3'') - very itchy. so i cut out the tags and they are sewn with some kind of hard poky plasticy thread - now even more itchy! i will have to wear these inside out.
1," Soft knit, perfectly finished, comfortable and looks great on the model and the previous reviewers' mom.  it just looks too 'empty-nester' for my style (and i won't be until 2035!)  this is a nice base for a creative dresser/accessorizer, which i'm not.  i'm also messy so it's hard to keep ivory clothing coffee free.  i'm glad i tried it on because it proves how great a label knitted & knotted is for quality garments.  just had to pass on this for personal style reasons."
1,"Wish i could keep Beautiful sweater, unique knit mix and i love the color, but the fabric is too itchy. i was wearing a long sleeve dress underneath but the yarn was prickling my arms, bum and thighs.  colorblock patchwork arrangement made me look extra top hefty and emphasized my trouble spots (upper back/arms).  i ordered lp but it was too large so would recommend staying tts."
1,"*another* grey cardigan? oh yes... I have too many grey cardigans. i also have a lot of oversized cardis. but i had to have this one because the stitch pattern is so nice and the yarns are so soft and snuggly. how could i resist? the weave is a bit open work but it still keeps me warm & happy. it also lays in a way that doesn't make me look bulky and top heavy, which my body type already is. i feel sorry for the first reviewer who kept getting subpar sweaters. mine arrived brand new in factory cellophane. i would advise that this"
1,"Love but itchy for me Adorable & unique swtr & wld go w/ many things. note that 1 front pocket is slightly higher than the other. looks that way in the pic too. it's the ""retailer unique touch"". i don't mind abt that. it's too itchy for me. i ordered the sp to have shorter arms-fell just above my knuckles which is fine. i have many t-necks to wear under it but i decided i really didn't need another itchy swtr, so returned. no worry, retailer has plenty of other items of interest!"
1,"Just love mine! Surprised abt the prev review. i had picked mine up at the store a few months back. purchased my usual size s. it's a little oversized & soft. the front pockets really do appeal to me as always w/ a cardi. i wear the light grey cowled t-neck top w/ it called the ""carra turtleneck"" w/ paige black skinnys. i have the other colors in the t-neck as well which go well w/ it also. worn a few times when cool but lately it's been warm again. it's abt to be cool again & look forward to wearing. very comf"
0,"Itchy! I tried this on in the store and i couldn't keep it on my body for more then 30 seconds. it's extremely itchy, which is a pity, because i do appreciate the design. :("
1,"Fringed knit tunic The stitched v-neck tunic is a very charming piece to your wardrobe. it is soft and feminine, and has added charm with the fringed bottom.
it is a comfortable piece that looks great with leggings or skinny/straight jeans. 
it is a loose fitting design, so it is a bit large. opt for a smaller size if you prefer a closer fit to your curves."
0,"Cute, but boxy I really loved the pattern on this shirt and the colors were nice too. something a little different than a plain white shirt. however, it was a little boxy on me and the material was kind of stiff (i am realizing that i am a sucker for soft material?). if this goes on sale, i may purchase it again, but i did end up returning the shirt."
1,"Perfect for a cool summer night Cute and comfortable top. very cute top that i will have to wait a few months to wear (until it is cooler out), but a great piece to pick up for a nice price! it is soft and comfortable with a generous amount of room, but not where you look too big. i ordered it in the blue, but really it is like a dark gray ? which does not bother me."
1,Great top - beautiful details Highly recommend this top. received lots of compliments on the day that i wore. recommend wearing with a tank top.
0,"Too long and shapeless I bought the orange color. i had a hard time styling it as it is so long. since it is a turtleneck and short sleeve, you'll need a jacket or sweater on top. nothing looked right. it has a relatively high and tight neck, so sweaters looked weird. short jackets didn't work either. i'm 5'4"" and bought the small. returned it for the charente cowl neck which worked much better"
1,"Love this top I sized up to a medium from a small and was glad i did. the top drapes nicely and the fabric is soft. 

5'7"" 140 lb 32 b, usually a small on top."
1,"Beautiful summer dress This is a very beautiful summer dress with plenty of lightweight fabric. i loved the colors and the design. i know that some other reviewer complained that this is polyester, and it is, but it feels like chiffon. the only two complaints i have are- 1. the dress is large, so go a size smaller than you would normally, and 2. this is dry clean only! if this is polyester, why would they suggest that it should be dry cleaned only? that is going to take a chunk out of the budget to get it cleaned. oth"
1," I love this to throw over leggings, covers your butt. great fabric and quality. i bought white and gray, after they arrived i knew i needed a black one, but, sadly, it doesn't come in black :(
i ordered xs, and it's roomy. size down for sure."
1,"Great staple tank! I ordered two colors and was happy with them both.  i wear tanks under many tops in the warm weather as so many are sheer.  i like a layered look, and having layers to peel as needed.  these tops are great on their own as well!  i recommend them to anyone wanting swing and extra length.  really love the fabric too!"
1,Beautiful As beautiful as in the picture. couldn't go wrong with it. excellent quality and gorgeous color.
1,"Perfect fun white dress I saw this dress in the store tried it on and , love! it is so hard to find a white dress that is not too fancy or frilly. this dress fits great and flatters my full figure (size 12 to 14), plus it has pockets! the woven material with the big fun flowers is accented by the plain band at the bottom which falls just above the knee. the center of the flower adds a nice three dimensional touch. i brought it in a large and i will wear this lovely feminine flirty beauty all spring and summer. from fun"
0,"A bit too swingy I wanted to like this top, as the fabric was nice and thick, but found that it dipped too low beneath the armpits, which would be ok if your lats are in perfect shape, but i've always found that cut made mine look a bit saggy (and i'm not heavy). not great enough to keep in my opinion."
1,Summer staple I bought this in white at my local store. great staple to wear in the heat of the summer or as a layering piece. i bought my normal size medium and it fits loose and flowy. i wore a nude racer back bra and felt comfortable without a cami. great basic addition to my closet.
1,"Polished versatility Missed these last year in black, so snatched them up when i saw them this season! great,versatile wardrobe piece - dress them up or down with knee-hi boots, booties, or great heeled pump with silk blouse or sweater. love something that i can wear so many ways, and look and feel polished and put together."
1,More than a legging These are as comfortable as any other leggings. they are thick enough that they are not see through (such a pet peeve when i see people with see through leggings). the front panel is so soft and i feel like it gives more of a professional vibe. they are a bit cropped/short but i'm tall so i'm used to this.
1,"Modern basic tee Quality fabric, nice fit and style. it's not sheer, which is ideal for such a lightweight tank for summer. i like the flowiness of the top, makes it comfortable, and super cute with fitted jeans"
1,Wanted to love it This is a great top and it fit me very nicely but it's much longer than it appear to be in the picture. i'm 5'2 and it was more like a tunic than a tank on me. if it were shorter it would be one of my favorite staples i'm sure. if you're very tall i think you will love it.
1," This is a beautiful top.  the detail in the pattern of the fabric is gorgeous and the color goes great with jeans.  love the design of arm holes, they don't show your bra!  the only con is price, but it's a keeper."
1,"Lovely basic for summer I bought the white in a m, one size down from my normal. i could have gone with a s, given the swingy shape and forgiving nature of the linen. it is very light and comfortable. the length is a tunic on me, at 5'6"", so keep that in mind. if you dry it in the dryer it will shrink for sure. i never recommend drying linen knits in the dryer because they will likely develop holes. i love this tank and will probably buy another color or two. if they get black or grey i will def. buy another one."
1," I'm so excited that retailer is bringing back some of the gorgeous fabrics and details they used to have. the all over embroidary is beautiful, the cotton/silk blend is delicious, and there's enough shaping that the top doesn't look too boxy. i did end up sizing down for a slightly more fitted loo and for a smaller armhole. i also picked through a couple of tops to find the one i wanted, since the embroidery pattern wasn't centered on some of them."
0,"Not worth the price I got this shirt in stores because it went on sale! i was excited to wear it, but it felt a little long on me. i decided that after a regular wash, it would help it. after washing, it shrunk way more than my other retailer clothes! now the arm straps feel really tight and the fabric lost its flowy-ness. it's a classic shirt, but it may not be worth the price for the quality of the fabric. be careful when washing."
1,"Awesome! I love these pants. they are very flattering and comfy, and look like real leather. they are also machine washable which is great. i've worn mine 5 times already."
1,"Bought in 4 colors! This is one of my favorite tanks i have ever worn. the swing style means you can wear it with any pants, and the straps are wide enough to accommodate a serious bra. i usually wear an l/xl but am wearing a m in these, so definitely size down at least once. you will love this!"
1,"Great if cut right I purchased this top in white and lavender. the white is very nice, soft and semi-sheer but not completely see-thru (fine with a nude bra). it is a swingy fit and slightly longer in back than front, but i expected that. i purchased a medium and it's plenty roomy. i am usually between a medium and large in retailer tops so i would consider it tts for a very relaxed fit. 
the lavender fits slightly looser and the hem is really uneven. it looks in some of the photos like this might be intentional, b"
1,"Perfect summer dress Simple style with a great fit. love the pink, mustard, and cream colors together. fits true to size."
1,Great basic- but long! I'm fairly petite and was not expecting this to be as long as it was on me- it's actually great for leggings or skinny jeans though- good quality material too!
1,Perfect Love this tank! so easy to throw on quickly and still look out together!
1,"Overall great look This top is overall very flattering! i am petite but large chested and the small fits great in the front, although it bunches a little bit in the back where the tag is - i think because of the crossing straps but nothing that will gender me from wearing it. i got the pink and i do wish it were a little more pink - it's so light that it almost looks white. overall i am happy with this sale purchase!"
1,"Love this top This tank fit perfectly and goes with everything, will be purchasing in more colors!"
1,"My new favorite summer dress This dress is so much more stunning in person than in the photos. it's incredibly flattering, and i like how it pans out at the bottom. it also has pockets! although it has a built-in slip, it is a little see-through, so keep that in mind, otherwise, i can't wear it enough."
1,"Beautiful skirt This skirt is classic, very high quality and even better in person. it runs true to size. the material is slightly thick and will be great for fall, winter and early spring. my only complaint is, i wish it had pockets. i love tracy reese designs. i can't wait to wear this for thanksgiving."
0,"Really thick, quality top. very swingy bottom I bought the red and white. both tank tops were a nice, thick material- definitely high quality. i was hoping there would just be a little bit of swing at the bottom, just enough to be loose and flattering. but there is a ton of extra fabric at the end, which with a larger bust wound up edging into looking a little maternity. but i think it'd be great on you if you tend to do well with very drapey or swingy tops. it runs a touch big- im normally between a small and an xs, and the xs was not even"
1,"Really nice I have been looking for leather or faux leather pants for a while, and these look great. they are more expensive than other faux leather pants, but the quality is much higher. i'm glad i didn't buy the cheap ""leather look"" pants i keep seeing. the only caveat is that they do run small, like the other reviewers said. i am a 27 pretty consistently in this brand, but i got the 28. they fit perfectly. because of the material on the back, they do not lose their shape, either. highly recommended."
1,"Love! This top is so beautiful!  really well made with solid embroidery - not the thin lightweight type.  i thought it ran rather large but i don't have the bust to fill in the top area.  i'm usually a small in tops (sometimes medium due to my height 5'8"") but went down to an xs so the arm holes didn't show too much.  length was still great.  a steal at the sale price!"
1,"Fancy sweatshirt This is a beautiful long midi blazer that happens to feel like a sweatshirt. buy it! you'll look super classy and put together. i wear to work and going out. i've been noted to also curl up in bed wearing this because it's so comfortable and i forgot to switch into a sweatshirt. 

note i'm on the short side so the ""blazer"" ends up being a little longer for me. i happen to like it because it gives it a little more formalness of a longer coat while still being spring weight (jersey/terry on the"
0,"Another synthetic fabric... So disappointed in the abundance of polyester fabrics that retailer carries these days. especially at this price point. the pattern and style of this dress is beautiful, but i will never spend two hundred dollars (or even half that) on a poly dress. please add more linen, cotton, and silk!"
1,"40's fun skirt I love tracy reese. this skirt did not disappoint. i saw it originally in store & fell in love. i waited to see if it would go on sale... and it did!

i put on the size 12 & it fit gorgeously. the fabric is a bit stiff and bulky- but i think that's so it holds its shape. first thing i went into my living room & began twirling around.

i am 5'5"" 150lbs. athletic build. the sizing is true to tracy reese. i'll need to get the skirt hemmed as it's quite long on me. but- this little gem will be worn"
0,Very roomy For me this had too much material and was a little too tent like. a beautiful dress but not my style. i prefer more a line with not so much material.if you are looking for something roomy this is a good choice.
1,"Unexpected find I was at my local retailer this weekend, needing a bathing suit for an upcoming trip and this set was sitting in the ""get it while it lasts"" section, in my size. i tried it on (top in two different sizes 32c and 34b and a bottom), and it was literally the only time in my life i've ever tried on a bathing suit and been happy with the results! great material, the design is retro but with a modern twist with the fabric, supportive top without squishing (went with the 32c...same as my regular bras), t"
1,Runs small The front of these is the leather looking material. the back is just a stretchy material. they are comfortable but they run very small. i consistently wear a 27 in this brand. i purchased that size but could barely get them up. definitely size up. i had to exchange. they are cute but i'm not sure they are worth full price. the quality is mediocre and i think you can buy faux leather pants for less at another store.
1,"Great pair of jeans!! I was hesitant to buy these jeans online because citizens are generally not very forgiving, being that they don't have much stretch.  they are always in the stack that i try on but haven't bought a pair of citizens in several years. these are totally different!  the have enough stretch to be sculpting without being uncomfortable while keeping the substantial feeling that comes with denim versus leggings.  i looooooove these jeans!!!"
0,I like the feel of the fabric but... It feels soft and like a good quality. however it really does run large and long. i was looking for a loose tank but this one was almost a tunic on my short height and even with a cardigan to give it a shape didn't work out. i also thought it would shrink in the dryer but it didn't. also wrinkles easily.
1,Love these!! These pants look great on and i love the ponte fabric on the back of the pants.  i usually wear a 28 in pilcro but i went with a 29 for these.  great length and my only criticism would be the price.  a little expensive for vegan leather.
1,"Absolutely beautiful. I somehow overlooked this online and saw it in the store. i am a 10/12 or m/l. i tried on the medium and it was tight in the bust but fit great in the waist. i ended up ordering the large online. the large felt good but a tad big in the waist. it hit my true waist though and looked good. i then noticed the straps were agustable. i wonder if i tried the medium and loosened the straps if it would have worked. either way i love the dress, so pretty and flowy. i wasn't bothered by the fabric and did"
0," Love at first sight (via the internet); upon arrival, i was on the fence.
.
the fabric is slinky and loose; so much so that i should have ordered a medium instead of a large
(perhaps then the dress would have then been more of an a-line fit vs. an over sized dress with no body).
the lower section of the sleeves is attached intricately to the upper arms;
every slight movement of the body is followed by a slight tug at the sleeve/arm cloth;
otherwise, when the arms are extended, the sleeves do hav"
1,Super sexy Love these pants. they look great with a pair of mid calf boots and a loose t-shirt. i usually wear a size 26 or 27 but went with a 27 on these. they are very flattering and edgy. love them!
1,"Stylish l comfortable l versatile These leggings are great because they are comfortable, stylish and can be dressed down or up. great pair of fun leggings to wear. i'm 5""3' and 180 and so i'm not a skinny girl, but they are flattering on me. i love them!"
1,"Pretty l flowy l comfortable Comfort is very important to me. as someone who is not a skinny girl, slimming clothing is important to me. this top is very pretty, comfortable, and can be dressed up or down. it does require dry cleaning, which might be a con for some people."
1,"Super cute! I tried these on in the store in the small and needed to xs, so i ordered them online. they are perfect! i wore them last night and got so many compliments. for reference, i am 5'2"" and 125 lbs."
1,"Beautiful but runs big! This dress is lovely- exactly as pictured on the site. love the colors/pattern and received so many compliments when i wore it to a brunch party. could easily be dressed up for an outdoor wedding. it definitely runs big- i am usually an 8/10 and originally ordered in a large. was way too big, so had to exchange for a m and there was still some room. make sure you size down!"
1,"Beautiful and flattering This dress is very comfortable, very flattering and just lovely. my only critique is that the skirt is more rust colored in real life, where on the website it looks more red. and the bodice looked a bit more peach/pink in the picture. still a beautiful, interesting, well made and extremely comfortable dress. thanks retailer! i am 5'9, 155# and the m is great."
1,"Velvet maxi dress for the win This velvet maxi dress is what fall dreams are made of. it fits very true to size and is the perfect length, about to ankles. the material is soft and had so much subtle details in it... gorgeous! once the weather cools a bit it will also pair nicely with tall boots, and an undershirt. i plan on rocking this all fall and winter!"
1,Sizing is odd I love the look of this dress on the hanger in the store and in the pics on the model. but i purchased my usual size 0 in petite ( i am 5 ft 2 in.). it was very form fitting-too much for me- and had little gaps near the waist that i attributed to it being tight the hips. i exchanged it for a 2 petite and that was too large and gaped in the top and waist. for reference my measurements are 32-26-35. so i am going to deduce from my experience and the other reviews that this dress might be best sizi
1,"Amazing dress!!! This dress is gorgeous in person, but its very, very, very fitted. i wear a size 8 in most retailer dresses. i ordered the 8 and its not an option, not even with control undergarments. i sent the 8 back and re-ordered in a size 10. i wouldn't be surprised if i need the size 12. i hope it works because this is a beautiful dress. the pattern is stunning. the red is a deep brick shade. the fabric is thick, but not too thick to prevent transitioning from season to season. as other reviewers said, i am"
0,"Not impressed After reading the glowing reviews i was excited to buy this on sale. i'm tall and lean, but found the dress looked slightly awkward and off on me compared to the model pictures. firstly, the top has a strange transition to the skirt, with extra fabric you have to either blouse over the skirt or bunch together. if you blouse it and lay flat, it invariably gets bunched as you wear it. this bunching changes the aesthetics of the color blocks, creating less clean lines. i also found the blue, black"
1,"Wonderful comfy maxi This is a super cute, adorable and flattering maxi. it's very comfortable and soft. i stayed tts in this dress... the length hit just right .. ...perfect for summer"
1,"Love them! They are exactly as picture. i have a lot of extra skin on my midsection, due to pregnancies. they are a little high waist so they grab all the midsection perfectly. the fabric is good quality, the tones are just beautiful... it is a little bit see through on your bum. i always try to hide my bum so no issue for me."
1,"You will feel so elegant! As part of the over 60 crowd, i rarely wear dresses any more - but this called out to me.. and it didn't disappoint! i ordered the plum - true to size and and color. i usually wear a medium and it fit perfectly. i liked the previous review suggestion and i will also wear this with boots and t-shirt to get more use out of it as well as dressing up.it's a real keeper."
1,"Beautiful material I debating this dress for a long time. i just was hesitant because it is very form fitting. i think this dress runs true to size. after reading other reviews, i was debating ordering a 6 (i'm normally an 8). and i am glad i went with the 8. it is form fitting. the material is just absolutely beautiful and not stiff. it is a bit thicker, which will be nice in the fall. colors are true to the pictures shown and length falls as shown on model."
1,"Great staple So versatile and comfortable. i plan adding this into my rotation year round under a jacket or cardigan during the colder months. if you prefer baggier fit, i would suggest going up a size."
1,"Beautifully made jacket This really is a gorgeous jacket! i would give it 4.5 stars just because sometimes it can be a bit unflattering in the tummy area (poofs out a bit) at certain times, but i had to remind myself that is the style of the coat. i am petite and curvy on bottom, so this could just be me. tried wearing with a skinny belt and it looked cute, i think i will try both ways. seems very warm. beautful colors and the material is soft and not itchy at all! excited because versatile for everyday wear but also l"
1,"Perfect fit! I got the moss and love the color. the style and size in 31p is perfect for my short self. very comfy for work. now, i need more colors..."
0,Wanted to love This dress is really attractive in terms of the pattern and the neckline. but the dealbreaker for me was the lack of darts in the back hip area--so that the stretch fabric really hugs the full curve of your booty. a size larger gave me bagginess in the top and a still snug fit in back that i just didn't feel comfortable about. some darts could have made a nicer fit here. but this is a a great dress if you don't mind a super body con fit.
1," I ordered this dress with great expectations after coveting one in a store, but unfortunately it did not work for me. the fabric is a stretch cotton jacquard which is absolutely beautiful, and the colors are gorgeous. i do not think it runs big, i sized up and it still fit me like a sausage casing. if you are tall and thin with no bulges, this dress is for you."
0,"Eh I love the colors of the teal dress, but i wish that the top only had one color. the design is cute but the construction is a little off. the transition from the top to the skirt seems to lay wrong or have a bit of extra fabric. sizing up or down didn't help. the top is lined but the bottom is very thin. the bottom should be lined too. not the best."
1,"Love` I love the pure and good short sleeve tees. they feel beautiful, and wash beautifully! i just hang them to dry and they are perfect for the next time, i buy a size medium as i like them to flow nicely at the hips!"
1,"Simple yet stunning I ordered this dress in the orange and it is a perfect addition for my closet. its comfortable yet classy. i did order a size up and went with the medium because i am a dd. so glad i did because the top part of me stays secured. if i went with the small, i am afraid i would be falling out. it is long but i will take to a tailor and have them make some adjustments. its a versatile dress and can be worn at events or just for hanging out in."
1,"Love the colors This dress first caught my eye because of the beautiful color combination. and when i tried it on, i was sold. it's super soft and comfy and just the right amount of coverage."
1,Looks exactly like the picture I bought the black version of this dress. looks exactly like the picture and is true to size.
1,"Sweet top! I just bought this adorable top in the black motif and was surprised by how good it looked! it runs tts (34d-27-35) and got it in my usual size small. it's very soft, the print is so cute, the arm openings aren't too big and the length is just like on the model, not too long or short. i think it's even cuter in person and i like the price point. a very sweet top so worth a try!"
1,"Soooooo cute I really like this. it's not too baggy and not tight. it drapes nicely. and the pattern is a bit dainty without being frilly.
i love this blouse."
1,"A lot of give in these I bought these in my standard 27 (on sale, woop).  they are super comfortable with a bit of stretch for those days when you need a little extra room.  the ankles are easily cuffed and look great with ankle boots.  my only qualm is that they run a bit big and tend to gape in the back.  i love a higher rise jean and these are a great option but i'd lean towards sizing down."
1,"Cute shirt for work or play I really like the red version of this shirt. it will add a pop of color under a blazer for work or it can be easily accessorized with a necklace, for the weekend. i am 137 lbs, a 34d chest and the small fit me perfectly."
1,"Buy it I want this in every color! fits tts...so comfortable, flattering, and fabric feels like it will hold up well (fingers crossed). love love love."

0,"So wanted to love it I so wanted to love this dress, despite the reviews. when i opened the package i fell in love with the fabric. the print is absolutely beautiful and the fabric feels luxurious. the dress fit perfectly but there was just too much fabric (even though i absolutely loved the fabric). the flowing overlay was just too much. i am returning it."
1,"Beautiful!! This dress is gorgeous! i sized up from my usual 6 to an 8, cause i'm not much for form fitted dresses. however, it was still pretty body con for me. i passed in it for now, but in the future i might try a 10 petite?? the color is a nice brick red with a textured whitish pattern. and it is soft ... like i wanted to snuggle up on the couch in it, but i had to refrain! i've been having bad luck with zippers from retailer dresses recently, but this one was smooth sailing and pretty too! the length wa"
1,"Great quality top! This top is beautiful in both colors, it was a difficult decision at the store. i went with the black, and my usual size s fit well with a little room, but in no way overly baggy. i tried on the xs which also fit but was a little constricting. the quality is excellent and i highly recommend this top. 1 question i have however, is that the online description says machine wash, however my tag states dry clean only. just curious if anyone has hand washed this yet? otherwise, it is a beautiful, comf"
1,"Not as short on me (petite) I ordered the xxs p as this dress is not a fitted dress, and that was the right size for me. only thing is the length is a bit linger still 9lower on calf for me), the straps are almost tight, so i would say the dress is a reversed taper shape. color is beautiful, i ordered green as the other color (plum) doesn't have petite available. green is rich, and classy, the fabric is surprisingly soft. i love the little details in the velvet. definitely need a strapless bra for this one.

1,Perfect top! I love this top so much! the fit is super flattering and forgiving in the tummy area-win.
0,"Pretty dress. fit was not for me. I love this maxi dress. it is fitted up top and very maxi like on the bottom. it was to much fabric for me, the dress made me look heavier than i am. i am 5'9' and 160. i fit in the medium. the dress just didn't do anything for my body type - curvy. i think you need to be fairly lean to look nice in this dress. sadly, i had to return. maeve makes great maxi's, unfortunately they don't fit me correctly."
1,"Beautiful This dress is simply gorgeous. the slit is just right, the colors are great, and most of all the fabric is very comfy! i highly recommend!"
1,Love pilcro! I love all the pilcro chinos. they fit great and the material is so soft. they also wash very well.
1,"Beautiful maxi! I ordered this in the neutral motif and the colors and design are more beautiful in person. unfortunately, there were no ""petites"" available when i ordered so i will have to have the length and slit tailored."
1,"Obsessed This dress is stunning - the cut, the color (mine is a dark green, not purple as pictured) and the material are all super unique and gorgeous. i first tried on a medium but it was a little too large - the small fit perfectly and still has the loose romantic look intended. i can't wait to wear this piece with a suede moto jacket, or even denim for a casual funky look. love!"
1,Easy summer dress I love white for summer and by august i am tired of wearing sleeveless...so this caught my eye. it is very easy to wear and pretty on. i wore it with black tie up shoes and accessories. super comfy & stylish.
1,"The perfect top for all seasons Love this top so much that i bought it in both colors. the fabric is wonderful and the pleated front is a nice feature. i also like the fabric covered buttons. you can button this top all the way or leave the top few buttons undone. either way, it looks cute. i especially like that it looks great under a blazer or cardigan and will look good uncovered when the weather heats up. great quality and features for the price."
1,"Fabric is a little stiff and did not drape well I ordered this online and really loved the picture. when i received the dress, it was lovely, but the color was more purplish-plum than red, and the fabric was super thick and a little too stiff. i was still hopeful, but when i tried it on, it wasn't flattering. the lines of the dress are very sculpted -- for example, the waist nips in, which would be good, but the place it nipped in was not at my waist (i am very short-waisted with longer legs and often have this problem with dresses). often wi"
1," Love this dress. i bought is for a tropic vacation my husband and i went on and it was great. i got so many compliments while wearing it, and it was comfortable! dress is a little roomy in the top, but not enough to prevent me from wearing it. i ordered a medium."
1,"Super cute!! I was nervous about this dress, as when i ordered it there were no reviews yet...and shortly after they, they started coming in and were only negative. yes it runs pretty big (i'm usually a large/12 but could tell from the model it would run big) but it's supposed to be loose. i wouldn't say it's the most flattering - but you can tell it's shapeless from the picture! it's a great casual dress, perfect for hot days when i don't want my clothing touching my skin."
1,"Cool but has it's flaws I bought the extra small and although i love the style and unique color combo, it's pretty large in the collar area and without the right blouse/shirt underneath it makes my neck look really skinny. the rest of the coat is true to size, longer and straight. the design just doesn't have the right balance for me so i'm sending it back."
1,"Great fit but odd construction This is a beautiful, flattering dress, however i can't decide whether to keep it or not! as a few other reviewers has mentioned, the transition between the ""top"" and the ""skirt"" is a bit off - it's like there is some extra fabric there, and the weight of the skirt pulls it down, making it a little awkward/bunchy. i thought it may have been showing up because i am larger chested (36d), but you can kind of see this on the teal dress image, under the chest where there is an extra fold. i ordered th"

1,"Works for maternity I bought this to wear for my baby shower at 34 weeks. i was able to buy it in my size and still get a great fit, and the skirt hits right at my bump with the band just above it. great option for expecting mothers that can be worn after baby, the top is also snug enough to feel like it covers properly (could be too snug if you are large chested though)."
1,"Favorite tee These t-shirts by pure + good are buttery soft and so flattering. they are just loose enough to drape beautifully and the detailing at the neckline takes them just a step above basic tee. i have 2 from last year, machine washed many many times (on delicate cycle) and they still look almost new. i was hoping to pick up a couple more but they're gone! please retailer, bring these tees back!! i would kill for that beautiful dark blue..."
1,"Just not for me I really love this dress, just not on me! i am very curvy, with a rounder stomach. i normally wear a 10 (5'8, 160lbs), and the 10 fit, but it is so fitted that i didn't like how it showed everything. if i had a flatter stomach, i would have kept it, but it just doesn't work on my body style unless i wanted to constantly be pulling it down (it was riding up a bit). the fabric is great, the color and pattern are so lovely i almost ignored my instinct and kept it anyway (my boyfriend, who is picky,"

0," After reading the reviews, i had high hopes for this dress but was disappointed that it wasn't flattering on me. 
i'm 5'4"", 126 pounds and generally wear a size small, but the small of this dress looked more like a maternity outfit on me. it squeezed the bust a bit too much, and left open some of the areas just under the arms that could probably have used a teensy bit more coverage to be truly flattering."
0,Elysian maxi dress I was disappointed with the style and quality of this dress. it poofs out funny in the waste and it just looks very unflattering. i'm sending it back.
1,"Elegant and comfortable! Just as breathtaking in person . . . and in a totally comfortable, soft, stretch fabric. i'm 5' 8"" 120 lbs. 34b; purchased the size 0 and 2 for comparison; decided on size 2 as the size 0 was really tight in the chest area--meant only for the tiniest! the dress is long on me and i'll likely get it hemmed up a bit so it hits just above the knees--but i'm grateful it's too long (something i can fix) rather than being too short."

This dress is gorgeous! i bought the patterned dress and it has the perfect colors for the season. the pictures just do not do it justice. plus it is incredibly comfortable. this dress could easily be dressed it up or down and is perfect for someone who is curvy on top. i can't wait to wear this on a date!
1," I've always had great difficulty finding a pair of shorts that i like the fit of - most are either too short, too thin, too low, or too tight. i have athletic legs that ""mainstream"" fit doesn't work well with, for the most part.

1,"Summer dress I bought this dress to wear as a casual summer staple. i like classic things with a twist, and this fits the bill. it is nice quality, and the colors are vivid. it is slightly tight in the bust line for me, but it is not retailer's fault that i am a bit too busty for this dress. i'll deal with it. otherwise, the dress is nice quality, and will come in handy throughout summer. the price is right, so grab it!!"

1,"Great length This dress is nicely made , fits well and is the right length."

for reference i am 5'5 145lbs, 38-30-40, 34ddd. the dress was low cut and showed too much cleavage for my comfort, but this may not be an issue for women with smaller breasts (or if you don't mind some cleavage showing). this length was also a bit too long, so if you are 5'5 or shorter you may want to order the petite size."
0," Frumpy is the word i would use to describe this top. i look good in empire waist shirts and seek them out. but this one made me look pregnant and frumpy. and it has an attached camisole, but the sheerness of the top still showed my nude-colored bra strap. so i don't even know what to wear under it. it's going back, even with the sale price."
1,"Lovely dress You can't exactly tell from the picture, but this dress has a skirt that bubbles a little at the bottom, and it really adds interest to the whole piece. i think my favorite part about this dress, though, is the weightiness of the skirt--it's not so heavy that it's hot or uncomfortable, but enough that it feels more quality, more special."
1,"Great quality, easy to wear dress! This dress fits true to size and is great to wear around on a warm day. you can dress it up or down so there are many uses for it. this brand has always provided great quality too. i'm excited for warmer weather!"

0,"Beautiful dress, not right for everyone I love the design and aesthetic of this dress but when i tried it on it was less than flattering on me and looked almost night gown ish:(  really sad because the material is gorgeous! i bought it for my sister instead because i know it will flatter her body type more than mine.  i'm rather full on bottom and top and it seems to look better on slender women.  the only complaint  is have is that the straps seem delicate. the actual material and fabric is crazy beautiful though!"
1,"Great maxi dress I love this dress. as a petite woman, it's hard for my to find maxi-dresses that aren't terribly long and that cut in the right places. this dress fits perfectly! i love the slits in the side that allow for a flowy look and make it easy to walk around. there is also an elastic band that helps the materials over the bust stay in place along your torso. if you a bustier person like myself, it will likely cut in just under your bust line as opposed to as your waist like on the model. since i am bus"
1,"Fabulous material.... I ordered this dress in a petite but it arrived in a regular, the rest fit and in the meantime the petites ran out in my size.  the dress is too long but it is so beautiful i will get it shortened.  the fabric is lovely.  i am blonde and the green is so nice with my hair... which is a good thing since the other colour was totally sold out.  try not to miss out on this lovely purchase....."
1, Loved the shorts version of these so ordered the pants but not quite the right fit for my legs. no fault of the pants just too skinny in the legs.
1,"Love this I purchased this in the ping/orange color. i am 5""8 and 155lbs, the medium fit perfectly. very soft texture with a nice flow. will be purchasing in other colors."
0,"Awkward fit Beautiful dress, but has an unflattering fit. i purchased an xs and it's past my knees and the bottom of the dress is so heavy! would be a perfect maternity dress though!"
1,"A great transitional piece Love it ! ...although i had to purchase it in 3 sizes before finding the right one. it does run large. i normally take a l or el ... but a medium in this had the perfect drape ! i am 5'11"" and 185 lbs and it is very flattering ! a perfect piece to be worn as a dress or as a tunic over skinny pants ... can be as sophisticated or casual as you choose to make it with accessories !"
1,"Much prettier and more flattering than pictured! This sweater is really lovely. it doesn't look like it does in the picture. i got the xsmall as i was worried it would run big. it's much shorter than i though, fits more like a petite size. the sleeves are 3/4 length, which i wasn't thrill with but accepted. the color combo is really lovely! it's very comfortable and well made and it was perfect for work but lovely with a pair of jeans too!"
1,"My dream chinos! They have all the features i've been searching for:
the leg is straight, not tapered or fitted. the fabric is soft, with an authentic worn-in look. the overall look is casual, relaxed and cool. i love these chinos and definitely plan to buy more."
1,"Loved his dress! I'm 4 11"" 120 and my usual small fit. as with everything....way too long. story of my life and i keel a tailor on call."
1,"Love I bought the one with blue and white top and black bottom. absolutely loved it! i am 5""2 so the dress is part is a bit long for me---ended up wearing my 4.5 inch heels to make it fit. the fabric is more heavy than what it seems in the pictures. but that makes it more formal. it's great!"
1,"Lovely The cut is lovely and the fabric is wonderful-it's a little thicker than you might think so it felt a little warm.
i am sending back as i have a little belly and it doesn't hide much-but it did make my boobs look awesome:)"
1,"So unique and lovely!! This dress was returned to our store and i was intrigued the second i saw it. the dress is definitely oversized. so much so that you could probably size down a size or two. but what i love about this dress is the style. its meant to be oversized...and with the print, the asymmetric cut and the oversized look...its very unique! the color is exactly as it appears and the material is wonderful. thin but soft and comfortable...really easy to wear! you could do this as a dress, or with leggings and b"
1,New favorite shirt I love how pretty and soft this shirt is. it falls well. i want to wear it everyday.
1,Classy and comfy I love this dress! it was a tad long ( i'm a shorty) but i loved the cut and versatility of the material/ design that i took it to the tailor. now it is perfect! i wore it to an engagement party but i could see it going very casual or very high end depending on styling. love.
0,"Looked a bit like drapes Beautiful shape and colors but the fabric felt heavier than i imagined. sort of like heavy drapes. also, the length (as others mentioned) was too long. i am not normally a petite but the regular was too long. unfortunately, it has to go back."
1,"Wonderful I love this dress! picked one up in store at 20% off--even better. i'm 6', 160lbs and 40-29-41, and i did find the waist runs a bit wide. because i'm tall, i think the length was a plus, but a shorter person would definitely want to go with a petite. i usually wear an 8-10 but bought a 6 in this dress, so i think it runs a tad large. the fabric is weighty enough to hide minor lumps and bumps, but i'll be wearing shapewear anyway. the pattern is perfectly aligned (just like the online images) and"
0,"Flattering but bad quality I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body, but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes."
1,"These jeans rock! These ultra-slimming jeans are so comfy. the rise is a little higher than i am used to but it covers those little muffin tops perfectly. the color is very dark - almost black which adds to the slimming effect. i have really long legs and these have a little extra at the bottom, which is great. you could wear with flats, booties, boots - just about any type of shoes. these are my new favorite jeans."
1,"Soft, comfy, and a very casual This just arrived today. the material is very soft and i love the olive color. it has a zipper in the back but i was able to easily slip this over my head, making me think it runs a bit large. because it is loose the fact that the drop waist hits right at the hip doesn't bother me, though i thought it would fall a little lower. i am only 5'2"" and i consider this to be a short dress. with thick leggings i think it will be great winter dress. the bodice is fully lined (the skirt is not) and the ne"
1,"Best dress i've ever found I loved this dress so much i bought in the cream/pink as well as the blue/teal. it is so light and easy to throw on. the slits are higher on me (i am 5'2) but not in a risqu茫漏 way. it's very flattering and gives it a little sassiness.

i wish they had even more colors to choose from. that is how obsessed i am with it!"
1," This dress is versatile and cute! i purchased the xxs at 5'4"" 115lbs and it fit perfect. a steal at the sale price!"
0,"Way too big This is such a great dress, i hate to return it. it's pretty, a nice material, and an interesting cut. but like other reviewers have said, it is just enormous. if there were a size smaller than xs, or if it came in petite, i would exchange it in a second. but since there's not, it has to go back."
1,"Cute but arrived dirty Cute dress- flattering and seems to be well made. however, when i received it it seemed that it had been worn. the bottom was all dirty and it had a white mark at the top. called and rep said they would send new dress if i send first back, so hopefully that gets here quickly and in good shape. the other dress i place with my order hasn't even shipped and the rep couldn't tell me when/if it would."
1,"Beautiful dress! This is instantly one of my favorite dresses but please note it runs large, size down! i am 5'10"" and regularly a size 8-10. i tried both of those sizes on in store and picked the 8. it was perfectly form fitted and the perfect length. when i got home i realized i had been reading the uk sizes on the tag and really bought a size 4. no idea how it fit me, i have never purchased a size 4 in my life! i am adding a photo so potential customers can see what it looks like on an average sized person :)"
1,"Best tee ever It drapes perfect and washes well. i own all the colors, they do not disappoint. i'm a medium."
1,"Staple My favorite pants, casual and a bit dressier by changing my top. comfortable, classic, well made"
1,"Love these I bought these pants in red after trying them on in store. they are soft and company. they have a loose fit, which is typical for chinos, so they pair best with a fitted top. i'm 5'2"""" and these were the perfect length when rolled. they run a bit big and stretch out though and eventually were too baggy. i loved them though so i ordered them in a size down. i'd definitely buy them in other colors too if they become available in my size!"
1,"Good quality for the price I purchased this dress in the red/orange color and was impressed by the quality of the fabric. the waist sat a bit higher on me that in does in the picture, so it looks much more like an empire waist on me."
1," I love this dress! i purchased the neutral motif in a large and it fits wonderfully. i have a double d chest and the top of this fits almost perfectly. it's just a bit snug on top but still comfortable because of the fabric. i'm 5""3 and the dress isn't too long like most maxi's are on me. i always have great luck with maeve and plan on purchasing another right now!"
1,"Soft & slinky It's lightweight, soft, & slinky, unike the average t-shirt. the slinkiness makes it skim the body nicely."
1,"Great dress The photos on the website do not do the dress justice. i am into texture, pattern and contrasting fabrics, this dress is gorgeous in person; not only has pattern, but the pattern is woven, so there is this wonderful texture as well that i had to try. some of the reviews said the dress runs large, others that this is a bodycon dress. i ordered a size 8 and my usual 10. both were figure hugging but the size 10 allowed this to be office wear while still being flattering. i am fairly straight, small"
1," This dress is so pretty and i instantly fell in love with it when i tried it on. i generally wear size 0 or 2 and opted for the 2 for more room. i know some reviewers felt that the dress ran too long at the bottom, but for me, i was sold on it because this dress is form fitting, i like a more conservative look for work. wouldn't want form-fitting and short dress. my favorite kind of dress is form-fitting and falls at or below my knees a little."
1,"Not for my big shoulders I'm petite, short waisted and slim hipped but with broad shoulders. the byron lars pencil dresses fit me perfectly so i was hoping this pencil dress would too (though with this brand my sizing fluctuates). 

unfortunately, the cut of the shoulders made me look like i had hammy arms. it was a little tight around the waist area and i could have probably gone up a size for a better fit width wise. length wise, however, it would have been too long for my torso, which i run into a lot. 

too bad."
0,"Too much fabric Alas, i so wanted to love this. the photos of the models wearing it look gorgeous -- flowy, drapey, ultimate grecian goddess. but it just doesn't work unless you're super-skinny. too much material. almost bulky; strange looking. the print is so beautiful -- i love the pink floral, and i love the whole idea of the dress. but it just doesn't work. have to send it back. 

(i'm 5'6"", 135 pounds, 38-30-38, and i ordered a 10.)"
1,"Comfy and flattering Perfect fit. this dress is super flattering, the criss-crossing fabric at the bust looks awesome on. the fabric is a little bit thicker through there which is nice for coverage. the skirt is light and airy and the pattern is so pretty! the perfect spring to summer dress!"
1,"Nice vacation dress I bought each color in three different sizes because the one i want was sold out. the lavender tile motif is the one i got in my ideal size medium petite and it fits the best. what i don't like is that the inside of the skirt is white, which features prominently because of the high side slits. makes the dress look low quality. my favorite dresses were the solid teal and solid black. however the small was too small on my bust and the large petite was too large on my bust. i'm wondering if wash th"
1,Stayed true I'm so glad i trusted my instincts and decided not to size down on this luxurious dress since my body type is so different from the previous reviewers.  size small would have surely cut off my circulation around my shoulders.  i bought mp since i have thick arms/shoulders/back and i'm short 135# 38-27-35.   my only gripe is how skinny and insubstantial the straps are so maybe i'll get those changed.  i'm tempted to buy the other color since this dress is so beautiful but i really don't nred it!
1,"Body con This dress is extremely body conscious. so if you want to make an impression, wear this dress. the fabric is thick and best worn on a cooler night. the pattern is gorgeously done, pieced together like a garment three times the cost. the cut of the armholes might not be flattering on those with broad shoulders or chubby upper arms (like myself). for me this dress is tts but way too long, so i will have to hem."
0,"Great style | not so great construction Bought this on a whim. i had been wanting a new maxi dress and the bodice looked really cool online. ordered it in black. it fits true to size however the material is a bit on the thin side and where the fabric crosses over on the lower waist line...it leaves a love handle lump. without the bulk it would be great as overall look is kind of cool. however, i am on the fence on this one. for the money there are better maxis out there."
1,Gorgeous dress I purchased this in the black in an xl. i am typically a 14-16 dress size and i would say this runs tts with a flowing fit on the bottom. the top is fitted but has some stretch to it. absolutely gorgeous fit and quality. i love this so much i want to purchase the teal color. a spring must have!!!
1,Closet staple! I have 3 pairs of these chinos i love them so much. they come soft like a well-worn favorite but are high quality at a great price. i'm typically a size 4. i bought the 26 size but think i could have gone down to a 25. otherwise very happy with this purchase!
1,"Nice staple t-shirt I purchased the pink top and really like it. it will be a ""go-to"". the material is light but not skimpy, and it has a nice drape to it. the length is good for me (5'4"") and it fits tts."
0,"Picotage sheath On me this was not good at all. couldn't get it off fast enough. the thick, stretchy fabric instantly added bulk to my frame and the leaf pattern over my mid section emphasized my belly (and i'm a size 2). also, the color is a dark, brick red and i think if it had been a true red it would have been much more attractive."
1,"Unique & cosy coat/jacket Very happy i purchased this jacket - although to me it is really a coat. it fits wonderfully and is so soft. i appreciate the uniqueness - not the usual dull winter shades of black/gray/navy. although i live in minneapolis much of the winter & it will not be warm enough once the temps drop beyond 20 degrees, it is perfect for the in-between 21- 50 degree days. i am a size 6 (5'5"", 135 lbs). tried the small & medium. the s was a bit snug in the hips so chose the m and it is just right."
1,"Cute and comfy dress This dress is very cute and super comfortable. as soon as i walked into work, i received a compliment. the fabric is not heavy, but actually on the thin side. if i knew this dress was maeve, i would have sized down. i'm always a large at retailer, but with some maeve items i need a medium. for reference, i'm 5'9"", 175, l/12. i love the look of a drop-waist, but because of my big bust i usually look silly, but this works."
1," I adore this dress. i wanted/needed to add a few velvet pieces to my wardrobe and when i saw this online i decided this had to be one of them. i'm 5'9 and ~128 pounds and ordered the x-small and it fits me perfectly. the color is so rich and the details are delicate, understated, and yet striking. i intend to wear this for a variety of occasions."
1,"Unique! I got this new dress for a work meeting and instantly received compliments. it has a very unique pattern that is perfect for the office or date night. it is a little long and falls below the knee, but otherwise the dress fits and feels great. the fabric has a nice weight, so it covers any imperfections you might want to hide."
1,"Like them.....but..... I really loved the look of these color blocked leggings online, but when i received mine, they're nothing like the ones in the pictures....the front of the legs on mine are mostly orange with a thin strip of white between the orange, then more orange!!! i like orange, but really was expecting the pretty color blocking like in the pictures not, mostly orange on both front legs, the back of the legs have more color blocking, but barely any of the light lavender color"
1, There's just the right amount of billowy grace in this dress. the fit is perfect and the material moves and breathes with you. cute with a jean jacket on chillier days too.
1,"Work of art Wow, wow, wow! this is so retailer! the dress is more breathtaking in person, it is a beautiful work of art from top to bottom. the fabric is super soft and flows perfectly. the lining is super soft as well, and it doesn't fall all the way down to the hem so that the burnout detail would show through on the bottom. i don't like spaghetti straps but the straps are very sturdy and high quality, very comfortable. fyi, the color is much richer (a shade darker) in person, like an eggplant color. i orde"
1,"New favorite! Looove this so much. the color in person is a rich wine. the pintuck and button details are hard to see in the photo, but there are three buttons so you can chose to open a couple."
1,"Dream dress I bought this unique beauty in a size 0. the fit was superb and without compromise. the ascetics are incomparable, as well as the quality. the most stunning dress i have purchased from retailer in quite a while!"
0,"Didn't meet expectations This ran a bit small; i'm normally a 2, this was a 4 and 'just' fit. the pattern was very 'digi,' the length was shorter than i hoped (i'm 5'1""), and the fabric, while structured, was just cheap and acrylic-feeling. pass."
1,"Love love love I love love this top, it look so much better than expected. i bought black because red wasn't available in my size. the style, print, and fit are perfect. the shirt-style hides flaws, and the top looks very good and stylish. it can be worn for formal or casual occasions. i keep looking to see if the red one is available in my size, i would buy it in every color. perfect!!"
1,"Great quality; on the warmer side The attention to detail in aligning the pattern is excellent as always with this brand.
.
i tried a size 2 and it fit fine, just above my long waist ( 5'2"", currently 33-25-37.5 with narrow hips and fuller thighs). i have several other cartonnier shorts in sizes 0 and 2, depending on my weight, and these fit similarly. i think the size 2 petite would be a bit lower but it's sold out now.

the only reason i passed was that the fabric has a polyester fusible interfacing so that it keeps its s"
0,"Huge!!!! This could seriously fit a large and it's an xs. so frustrating!! this is the fourth retailer dress that is ordered that is just enormous. i get the whole ""loose fit"" style, but seriously??? you've taken it to a whole new level, retailer!!! another trip to the store to return another item. a complete waste of my time. ugh."
1,Cute and versatile Picked this up at the local retailer in both colors. the red version was styled in the store with the adorable blue snail cardigan - which i also bought. highly recommend.
1,"Casual maxi I didn't hate it, but i don't love it. i purchased it in 2 colors b/c i thought i'd fall in love. it is just ok. maybe it's b/c i have a larger chest, but i felt like it was too small in the chest area and too loose elsewhere. not the maxi fit i normally go for. however, the material is great and it's a simple sunday dress to lounge around in and run errands comfortably."
0,"Didn't work This didn't work for me.  the piece looked cheap, rode very high...needed to be longer.  the piece looks incomplete for some reason to my eyes.  it also does not seem quality for an retailer piece.  this went back."
1,"Pretty dress! Tts. i'm 38c, 8-10 and m fits just right. nice and fitted at the top, flowy skirt. i got the cream and love the skirt pattern."
1,"Cute and versatile Just bought this top in the black at my local retailer and i love it. it fits well, not too large and ""tenty"". it actually fit me under the arms, too. usually, retailer tops tend to run huge, not this one. i love that it is easy to layer with a long boyfriend cardi or a more structured jacket. i'm 5'3"" 110 pounds and took the xs. i would definitely recommend this top!"
1,"Adorable sweater! This sweater fits perfect and the pink trim makes it stunning! i was pleasantly surprised when i tried this on. i don't usually pay this much for a cardigan, but the quality and feel are better than usual."
1,Dreamy cozy pants These pants are the perfect weight and comfort. they are cozy enough to wear around the house and sleep in as well. i highly recommend these dreamy pants.
1,Great color The picture is not a good depiction of what the skirt actually looks like. the colors are more varied and green is the dominant color. it looks great on and the colors compliment each other. i would definitely recommend it as a daily go to item for your wardrobe.
1," Very unique, cute top. i had to order up a size as i thought it ran a little on the small size."
0,"Super cute, really poor quality I really loved the way this shirt looked on me. it's forgiving and flattering, and really lightweight. the fabric, however, couldn't even withstand half a day's wear without snagging 3 times and developing a hole right in the center. i have no idea how this happened, as i wasn't wearing or near anything that could have pulled at it. 

such a shame. this could have been a staple wardrobe piece for me."
1,"Great pants Good quality, fit and length! love them:)"
0," Beautiful blouse in theory, however, on my 5'9"" frame it came off like a costume. i truly had a nice chuckle as i looked at myself in the mirror. had to sadly return it"
1, The only complaint i would have about this pullover is that it runs a little big. i ordered a small and it is a little big for my taste but it is not something worth returning it for. i wouldn't say to size down but be aware it is larger than what you would expect. still love it!
1," I have these pants in the brown & red colors, and i love them both equally! they are stretchy, and stretch out a very little bit as you wear them, but retain their shape & neatness."
0,"Awesome shirt but doesn't hold up well after washi I got this shirt and loved it so much the first time i wore it. it swings well and is an easy basic that looks great. however, after i washed it the first time, it became clingy and stuck to me and doesn't lie right. it's such a shame because i was thrilled with this as an addition to my wardrobe!"
1,Classic! This fit great. i am 5'8 and 130 lbs. i ordered a size medium and it fit perfect. i wore a black tank/cami underneath for warmth in the office.
1,Nice dress to hide flaws This dress is great for hiding any insecurities. it's also very comfy.
1,Cute but tight in the chest I have several tiny tunics in m. i received this one today and it is very cute but too tight in the chest. i'm returning it for a large.
1,"Lovely Love the top, it fits wonderfully, and it's lightweight. my only complaint is that it has little loops that are prone to getting caught on things. other than that, it's a great spring top."
1,"Too sheer for me I loved the material's texture and drape, but it was too sheer for me. i am 100% against having to wear a tank under white tees. (which means i have a lot of trouble finding any white tees, but...) 

other than the see-through nature, i loved this shirt!"
0,"Not sure who this would flatter Definitely agree with the other reviewers. this top looks great on the model, but pretty bad in real life. super boxy and has no give so everything just hangs. if you plan on ordering, i'd recommend sizing down."
0,Not as pictured I received this top in the mail today not what i expected at all! it is a great fabric just way too much of it. it is proportionally incorrect width wise. unfortunately this one will be going back.
0,Disappointed I love tiny button down tops. this one didn't work at all for me. i was excited about the mix prints but on it looked like i was wearing a vest over a striped shirt. also the arm was frayed on the shirt i tried on.
1,"Beautiful and comfy! I have been thinking about getting this dress for a while, but was holding out because i was concerned it would look like a sack! but i am so glad i got it, and so glad my usual size was not available! typically i'm a m or a m petite but i ordered this in a s petite. while still flowy, i think it would have been overwhelming in my usual size. i think it will be great for many occasions as the solid black can be dressed up or down. i can't wait to wear it! definitely consider sizing down."
1,Can be dressed up or down This shirt is as cute on as it looks in the pictures. i love the fit and felt great in it on a mom's night out with jeans and heals. i also think it could be dressed up for work or further down for a day out and about! love it!
1," It's difficult to tell, but the skirt is 3 colors. the pockets are dark brown and the hem or bottom part is army green. skirt fits pretty well but not great. , i'm almost 5 ft 6 in and it hits close to where it hits on model. i would have liked it better slightly longer. i'm 135 lbs and size 6 fits but is slightly on tight side.
material is high quality and thick cotton."
1, This is my new favorite dress!
1,"Unique lightweight knit I think this is going to be a love or hate top. i love it. it is see through, requiring an under top. however, the fabric is extremely light weight and the style is floaty so a simple lightweight tank/cami will look pretty showing through in a number of colors. i bought the off-white. it is meant to be a full fit but i think going down one size will help especially since the photos don't show just how full the back really is. the fabric will probably snag easily. still i just really like the sty"
0,Boyfriend adores it. but runs small I agree with the previous review that this skirt definitely runs small. i am normally a size 4 with rooms but this size 4 was very tight. i decided not to go through the trouble of exchanging and to keep it. my boyfriend seems to like the style more than i do so that's a good thing :)
1,"Cute very oversized t-shirt This is a cute waffle t-shirt material is very thin and see-through it's a cute shape and style but it runs absolutely huge 
 is not a shirt for petite people
 the extra extra small was huge"
1,"Runs small I am so in love with this skirt, but unfortunately it runs at least one size small...since i am a 16 there is no sizing up. the color, quality, and style are perfection but i would say this runs as more true to junior's sizing than a regular women's size. so sad because it will be going back."
1,"Quality fabric Color was a perfect match for the linen slacks i wanted to pair it with, however the top was way, say too big so i'll be sending it back."
0,"Big, baggy, boxy The fit of this top is nothing like in the photo. the blouse on the model must be pinned back to achieve that fitted silhouette. in reality this top is baggy and boxy and runs at least one size large. the embroidery, details, and soft material are great, but the fit is off entirely. this item is going back."
1,"Like it a lot but... I like this top a lot, very nice. i love the design, style, and fabric. but it runs too small. i have a curvy figure, and it pulls in the front so you can see between the buttons, and pulls at the bottom as well. i usually wear l or xl, in xl this one was still a bit fitted especially around the bust. i am still keeping it - hoping to lose a few pounds. but it is a very nice top with the fabric, design, and style. very stylish! it looks casual on the model but can be dressy."
1," Great skirt, can be dressy, work or casual, love it!"
1,"Slim fitted silouett I purchased this lovely blouse to go with slim cropped stretchy pants. good for bum coverage while still looking sleek and tailored. i purchased the medium instead of small as this is a true fitted button up style and i wanted to avoid the gaping at bust. the arm holes are fitted nicely as well, no bra exposure. looks very nice on. on point for sure?.
 (for reference i'm 5'5"",34dd, ruler shaped figure,narrow shoulders and usually a small or medium at retailer.)"
1,"Love this top, with a slight modification I saw this top in my local store and almost didn't try it on solely because i hate split-sleeve/cold-shoulder tops. but, the peplum style and pattern were so cute that i took it into the dressing room anyway. after trying on probably 6-8 items, i wound up buying this top and one other. i really like the fit, as i am high-waisted, and it defines my waist really well . the wide neck is also super flattering. and i love the pattern. i went ahead and purchased, despite the fact that i wasn't thrille"
1, I love this shirt! i received many compliments on it when i wore it to work with a skirt.
1," This top is way cuter in real life. it looks a little frumpy on the model but t is very flattering on. the sleeves are split so not a warm top, but this will be a nice transitional piece. i am always looking for interesting but classy tops to war to work and this fits the bill."
1,"This vest will work in the warmer winter in texas The sherpa vest i received from retailer was the color the model is wearing.. the same hue and shade of both the faux shearliing and faux leather. i'm very satisfied with the vest. i believe it runs a bit large. i usually wear a large, sometimes an extra large yet the m/l fit me fine. shearling is very in this year and this will complete your look-wearing either pants or skirts."
1,"This skirt was a great purchase. I love the style, easy to wear to work or out for an evening. great quality."
0,Misleading The color is completely off! i loved the way this vest looks in the picture! i was excited to have that vest but unfortunately what i received in the mail was a huge disappointment. it came wrinkled and the brown is not as rich as it is in the picture. very pale. horrible.
1,"Not for those curvy on bottom Love the material and style - a very versitile skirt. however, doesn't fit well for those who don't look good in the slimmer looking pencil skirts."
1,"Off-kilter design has pizazz This is an intriguing looking skirt, with it's sharp diagonal and the ""quilted"" optic pattern front panel. it's a nice twist on a black pencil skirt. i've been wearing it with a longer, wrap sweater in the cold, but imagine that i'll be able to wear it into the spring and maybe even year round with lighter weight tops. the fabric is a little thin in the back and the diagonal doesn't lie as straight or look as sharp as i'd like but for the sale price i paid, i really shouldn't complain. it's also"
1,"Easy interesting top This top is really comfortable, and the details make it easy to add interest to an outfit. i was worried all the details together would be a bit overwhelming, but it works. i wish the design was on the back as well, but it's fine. the material is a nice light weight, but the pleats do fold up a little after washing, so ironing is required."
1,"Amazing skirt for every occassion! Retailer does it again! i'm constantly looking for pieces that will work for a day at the office and then a night out, and this skirt is perfect! you can't really tell in the pictures, but there is a larger slit that separates the grey material from the black, which makes the skirt have more of a statement. it runs true to size and the material is thick enough that it will do great in winter!"
1,"Nice classic look This skirt is great and you can't beat it for the price. it fits more like a pencil skirt on me, and looks sort of a-line on the model. very nice work appropriate skirt. though the slit comes higher than i expected. my thighs are tattooed so i put on some black tights and it looks great with a blouse and cardigan!"
0,"Split sleeves -- you can't tell from pics online! Tried this on and loved it except for one thing -- the sleeves are split, so any movement reveals most of your arm, shoulders. which also makes it fairly impractical for winter/the office (yes, i could wear a sweater or blazer with it, but that defeats the purpose of having an all-purpose cute top.) why, retailer? this is a perfectly cute top and looks great with jeans etc., but the split sleeves make it a no-go."
1,I love this skirt! It fits great. it is super comfortable. have gotten many compliments on how this skirt looks on me!
1,"Elegant and creative This blouse is a great transitional piece. as other reviewers have noted, the sleeves are split and that's the only reason why it gets four stars instead of five. i wore it with a 3/4 sleeve black top underneath to eliminate this issue for the cooler months. overall design is good and the print is classy and creative. this will be a lovelyt go-to blouse to wear with denim. fits the budget too."
1,"Better in person This top is prettier in person than on the picture. the picture kind of makes the material look really cheap - it actually looks nice in person. it's very comfy and feminine, showing just the right amount of skin on the arms. the elastic on the waist also makes me look 3 lbs. lighter. it goes good with jeans or skirts."
1," This blouse is just so beautiful! but i do love white blouses, so that may influence my enthusiasm. however, once i buttoned it up, it was just dreamy. i have a long torso and am tall for a typical xs, so it's often hard to find something that's the right length. this is perfect! it may overwhelm some ladies who are on the petite side of height, but it's a rare find for me. paired with a pair of cropped pants because i'd come in a dress, it looks delightfully vintage in the best of ways. i'm sti"
1,Super cute!!!! Very flatttering skirt ! super cute ! highly recommend !
1,"Two for one This is a high-quality swimsuit that can be worn inside out. easy to wear colors, fantastic pattern placement. the other side is an intense blue. i would suggest going by the size chart on the mara hoffman site. 
.
 i think this should look great on athletic figures. the back is low-cut and the bottom has medium coverage, not as skimpy as brazilian cut bottoms. not ideal for hour-glass figures as there is no bust support, and you will show quite a bit from the side (it is cut in at the front w"
1,Gorgeous top! Wearing this today! it fits true is size & is machine washable. the slits make it unique. don't hesitate to purchase this one.
1,"Pretty, but boxy I really liked this top, but it was very expensive even when on sale, and it ended up being boxy. i am flat-chested (32a), 5'7'. if i remember correctly, i tried on the xs. it was cute, but it wasn't flattering because it was so boxy on my frame. perhaps it'd be more flattering on other body shapes. i think it would be cuter if it was a bit more fitted. otherwise, the quality seemed great, though i'd be worried about all the beading falling off eventually."
1,"Perfect winter dress This is the perfect sweater dress for any occasion. i dressed it up with a belt and necklace for a christmas party and wore it with boots to just kick around the house. it's a really warm dress too, so great for colder weather. probably would not want to wear this dress in warm temps.

it's so comfortable and it's made with high quality material. i'm curvy on the bottom and my only wish is that this dress had less material around my waist- it's a pretty straight cut."
1,Sweater I loved the way this sweater was made.  my arms are really short so the sleeves were way too long and looked silly rolled.
1,"Simply floaty I purchased the white in the store in a size 6. 34d. i ordered the black online in a 6 and the lining was a bit snug. (i can maybe remove the black lining) however, i really like how the peplum looks. the v neck and bra friendly design are a perfect marriage. i see wearing these through the fall with a denim jacket or cardigan. for now i am enjoying how floaty and feminine i feel. i think this is a perfect top for women with a larger chest as it gives a nice shape but doesn't look maternity or b"
1,Comfortable and cute I had been looking for this dress in xs. the small ran large on me and xs had sold out online. i'd been searching for it calling every store around and not having any luck.. when allison called me from store 428 highland village in houston.. she had found the dress for me in the woodlands.. i was able to purchase it and i can't wait to get it.. it will be perfect for the hot summer here in texas. thank you allison for such great customer service and retailer for employing such great staff.
0,"Too peasanty I read the online reviews and thought this dress would be a winner. it is tight in the chest (i am not busty) and i would have exchanged it for a larger size but i just didn't like the style. the material is beautiful but between the neutral colors and the style, i felt it was too ""little house on the prairie"". pretty but not the look i was going for."
1,Easy to throw on summer dress This dress has the perfect amount of swing to it that it hides a stomach - which i looooove! the blue chambray color is beautiful and it is lined partially. so here's what i don't like - this dress would have been so much better fully lined. now it could just be that i am extra sensitive to fabric and find it to be a bit itchy where the ruching is on the upper back of the dress. but i somehow can't get myself to take it off the hanger to wear it....i may just be returning this dress.
1," I tried this on in store in blue, and it's so comfortable. it's just the right level of loose to be flattering. for me, the cap sleeves were a little strange. they just didn't sit in a way that was flattering or seemed purposeful--not sure if that was the design or my body."
1,"Easy & fun summer dress I just bought this dress today, and it is absolutely stunning. it looks so much better in person than on the model. i think it runs true to size, however it does have relaxed fit. overall, the dress has nice quality fabric and nice flow, without adding bulk. great buy!"
1,Great detail This is a perfect outer layer for chilly mornings or nights. the detail on the back and sleeves is definitely retailer quality. the sleeves do run a little long though.
1,"Lovely, but big I adore this dress! as a mom of two under 2, i need things that are cute, but no-fuss. this is exactly that piece! beautifully lined, breezy linen fabric, machine-washable, and flattering. the catch is finding the right size to flatter. i'm 5'7 and 128...found my normal size small to be really big everywhere. i went with the xs to avoid issues in the shoulders, but i maybe could have gone even smaller. fabric doesn't have a lot of give, so if you are large in the chest, my guess would be a possi"
0,"Great concept, but fell short I normally wear a medium in retailer dresses, but ordered a small due to the reviews that stated how large this dress is. they weren't exaggerating!!!! the small was way too big for me, and the xxs and xs are already sold out. beware that you will have to size down at least 2 sizes to make the dress fit similar to the model pictured. it is going back for me!"
1,"Love the dress just not on I loved this dress online, however i did not love it on me. it was a bit snug in the waist and bust (i usually order a 2 or 4 but got the dress in a 4). i thought i would love the mid length but it felt awkward on me (i'm 5'10""). i think its a beautiful dress just didn't work for me."
1, Nice quality. too big for my taste. really liked the style but sleeves were very long.
1," This cardigan is so much more beautiful in person. i thought it would be very lightweight, but it has a nice weight to it. this will go with absolutely everything and looks lovely on!"
1," Such a cute dress but it runs large. i'm 5'4"" 130 lbs and am typically a size 4 can wear a size 2 in certain clothes. i tried on the xs and it was still too big. i would of bought it in an xxs but they are sold out. really a comfy laid back dress that would be comfortable in summer. if they get more xxs i'll buy it."
1,Very satisfied! I love this sweater! it does run a little large though. fits beautifully. great for cool summer nights and early fall. dress up or down.
1,Great light sweater I got the brown one and i'm very please with the softness of the thread and the light weight feel of the fabric.
1," This is the perfect day dress--loose fit, comfortable fabric. i usually wear a m or l in most dresses of this type, but the s actually was the best fit. i have worn it all summer and it's perfect for hot weather. just order smaller."
1,"Love the top and the message! Love this tank!! the cotton is very soft which also allows some flow. i've worn this to yoga, and to teach barre and cardio dance and it's a hit! as a life-long dancer, this was a must have. my only negative is since the sizing is either xs/s or m/l, it may run too big or too small for some. i tyically wear a m or 6 in retailer tops and this is a little large in m/l; however, not to the point of being distracted with straps falling or the like. highly recommend."
1,"Great dress! I am a size  14, and tall.  i was afraid that it would be too short.  the sales clerk grabbed a large,  and it fit! it's airy and lightweight and hugs nicely around the back.  the big surprise?  pockets! love it!"
1,"Soft and sweet I thought this sweater was cute online but turns out it is even cuter in person! the cotton linen blend makes it easy to layer over a tee shirt or blouse, and the neutral color goes with everything!
as a side note, included with my sweater was a signed postcard informing me that this item was not on hand at their distribution center. so they ""sounded the horns"", and their spokane, wa store ""saved the day"". thank you spokane, wa store and thank you meredith for packing with care! 
i love it!"
1, Really great pair of pants/leggings. considering a second pair. great flattering fit. i ordered the petite as well because i was concerned about the length but the stride on the petite a was to short and the regular was not too long after all.
1," I have a mixed feeling about this cardigan.
on one hand, i like it; on the other hand, there are some minor things i do not like.
first, i love its knit pattern; especially the pattern on the back.
second, i like a soft color of this cardigan.
on website pictures, two motifs look almost the same.
in reality, brown motif is light pink-ish while blue motif is light blue-green-ish.
third, texture.
this cardigan is made of linen and cotton, so it feels comfortable to wear.
if there are flaws"
1,"Beautiful shade of blue! I saw this online, visited my local retailer, found it! it is the most beautiful shade of blue, nicely textured material! i am 5'7"" and 148 pds, i bought the xs and it fits perfect! definately designed for us smaller busted gals!"
1,"I love this dress!! I bought this in the blue and you should definitely size down. it runs very large. it's amazingly comfortable and high quality. great length as well (not too short and not too long). it has a partial lining so it's not necessary to wear a slip which i love. i get compliments every time i wear it, even one of the saleswomen in retailer asked me where i got the dress. she was surprised when i told her it was from retailer from online. i liked it so much i just ordered the red plaid."
1,"Cute, yellow is darker This is a cute sweater, i agree that it's slightly boxy partly because of the side pockets which i think are cute. the yellow is darker than it appears on my screen, more like a mustardy-gold which is not great on my skin tone. i think it's true to size, i got my usual retailer size: xspetite (i'm 34aa, 26"" waist) and it fits just right. it's soft and a nice medium weight. on the packaging it was called a bomber, so i'd say it is cut a little like a bomber jacket."
1,"Not for anyone with a large chest!! I'm a 36ddd and although that's pretty large, i don't generally have trouble fitting into most retailer clothing. (the tracy reese amoret dress, for example, fits just fine in my regular size.) so, i ordered this dress in my regular size. well, i tried it on, and the right and left sides of the front closure on top were literally about 10 inches apart. there was *no way* this would fit, even if i went up 3 sizes. it's crazy!
this is a terrible shame because it's really a lovely dress and it fits j"
0,"Don't bother This dress really was huge, and not at all flattering. i don't know how they got it to look good on the model in the picture. material was nice and soft, but i really don't see how anyone could look good in this, no matter what your body shape is."
1,"So soft These pants are so soft and comfortable. i'm almost 5'6"" and the hem completely covers my ankles but does stop short of bunching. the only thing i'm not crazy about is the waist. it's pretty high and a bit loose so every time i get up from sitting i'm having to pull my pants back up. other than that, love that it's something that can be dressed up or down."
1,Soft This is a nice sweater. runs a little larger than size.
1,"Soft and comfortable Cute dress. i say true to size - but keep in mind it is loose and flowy and i purchased in my usual size medium and it fits perfectly. it's lined so there is no need for a slip. very comfortable and cool. i am 5'6"" and it is 3"" above knee. i paired it with the gemline lariat turquoise necklace and have already received several compliments and my day is only 1/2 over!
a great priced dress which holds true to retailer's quality and uniqueness of items offered."
0,"Short and shapeless Even on my 5'1"", short-waisted, 100 lb body, this was super short. it was also super boxy. not flattering at all. the blue was a good color but this is going back."
1,"Better in person! I was swayed to buy this via the reviews on the site -- and they are all correct! it is a beautiful piece. i got the ""brown"" colored one, but it is pretty much exactly the color in the picture, more of a khaki. 

it is a gorgeous sweater. the sleeves are very long, but easy to push up if they're too much for you. it is also very long, which i prefer but on shorter gals it may be overwhelming. it's a perfect shell for cooler summer nights and it dresses up a basic outfit."
1,"Effortless for summer Caught my eye at checkout, and had to run back to the dressing room for a quick try-on, which ended up being a great call! the dress is super easy and flattering, as the lining keeps it skimming over my hourglass shape. the fabric has a sweet floral texture, and the gathering takes a basic shape and makes it interesting. i'm 5'4"" and it came just above the knee in front, while the back was a bit longer (another flattering feature). this is going to be a summer go-to!"
0,"Scratchy gauze I am ever in search of a light, white, summer top. this is not quite it. there are two distinct layers, and each of them is the scratchy, starchy type of gauze. it would just roast me in the summer sun--but i run fairly hot in general."
0,"Runs short I really wanted to love this sweater however it fell much shorter on my 5'10"" frame than it falls on the model, between my belly button and hip, and the sleeves ended just below my elbow and were much more voluminous than they appear in the product shot. i do have long monkey arms though, so on someone more petite it would probably fit more like the model shot.
the quality of the knit seems nice, however the zipper used is very slim and light weight and got stuck twice just while i was trying i"
1," Loved the grey color and the design but the shirt ran huge. i ordered a 2 and it fit me like an extra large. i am 5'2"" about 110 pounds and not flat chested."
1,"Love the style, runs a bit small I usually wear a 6 for skirts and dresses, but when i got this in the mail, it ended up fitting a bit snug on my hips. other than that its super cute and has a great liner underneath!"
1,"Nice length These are a nice option if you want crops that are shorter than the typical mid-calf length, but you don't want short-shorts. they hit right at the knee, so the length makes them cool and comfortable for summer. i wanted them to run errands, walk my dogs, and generally to just hang out. they'll be nice when traveling too.
they run large. i usually wear a 28 but bought the 27 in these. ( 5'5"", 124 lb.) they also definitely stretch out while being worn, so you may be able to size down even furthe"
1,"Pretty good staple The sweater feels nice, but not as luxurious as some cashmere. for the sale price, it is worth it. found it a bit small, but still wearable. hopefully it will hold up well, as the zipper seems a bit delicate. overall it is a good basic piece."
1,Great top! This top fits exactly as it does on the model! it's flattering and comfortable. i wore it to work with dress slacks and got a lot of complements. it's easy to pair with pants or jeans. my only complaint is the material it's made of is a bit rougher and thicker than i thought it would be. but that's minor. i am a petite but this fit me well even though i got it in a regular size.
1,"Super cute, but... I decided on these last minute for a date last night and let me say...i looked hot. :) they are super cute and flattering (im slender, but hey, im also 53) and could be dressed up or down easily. the but is because when i got home i realized that i had ruined my new gel manicure from the black die! it comes off so easily that you should be cautious of your car seats, sofa, etc. i made the mistake of not washing first, but do! hopefully thats enough to help because these are great leggings."
1,"Great leggings I had purchased other sanctuary black petite leggings in the store and found these on -line. they are very flattering and well-made. runs a little small, i am 5'0 and 97 lbs; small fit more loosely which i prefer so i can wear them to work. thanks retailer for carrying great petite selection!"
0,Beautiful dress but.... I wanted to love this dress but it was too large... and once i washed it (which is recommended) it shrank so i had to return it.
0,"Flattering and comfy I love these leggings! the material is a bit thicker than your typical leggings material so it hugs without being too clingy like spandex. the fit i's somewhere between leggings and skinny pants. the suede fabric feels soft and looks to be of good quality. the petite fit works perfectly for me as well, no bunching at the ankles. i can see these being a staple in the upcoming months."
1,"Gorgeous I recently purchased this cardigan and got so many compliments the first day i wore it.  the detail is so exquisite, it will be worth every penny."
1,"Flexible sweatering Love this sweater! it is easy to wear and goes well with multiple outfits. it is a great, flexible add to my wardrobe. it fits well, even in the sleeves!"
1,"Favorite sweater this season I got this in navy and love it. the overall shape is sleek and classic - body skimming but not tight - with subtle detail in the knit design that make it entirely unique. the quality and weight of the cashmere is perfect - not to heavy or light. xs fit perfect on my 5'5"" petite frame. but busty or longer-torsoed people may find the length a bit short - it hits me right at the top of regular low-rise jeans. this may be my favorite retailer buy of the season."
1,Love it sadly has to go back This sweater is one of a kind just like many pieces from retailer. the design is super cute the color is perfect and others dont like the sheer material however for me since it's not see through i really like it. the reason for a return is they sent me the wrong size..ordered a small (i checked my order) and i got a xs petite. so sad since large is the only size left.
1, I love love love this dress for everyday running around or you can dress it up with jewelry or a scarf. so boho and so comfortable. buying the other color now.
1,Comfortable cardigan I loved the color (it is different than in the picture) and texture of this cardigan. it was very soft and comfortable to wear.
1,"Runs big! This dress was huge!! i'm normally an extra small and i was swimming in it. the xxs was sold out, but i think it would of been huge as well."
1,"Nice sweater This sweater runs large and long in the arms. i am 5'5"" and often wear petite in pants but not tops. the medium petite is perfect, the sweater is a beautiful open gauge knit and will be great this fall/winter for work over a tank and nice pants. the blue color is more of a mint green/blue, very pretty and different than anything i have in my closet. great addition."
1," Purchased this in the blue color in the store today. honestly, if i had just seen it online i would not have given it a second look. it really is beautiful in person. the bell sleeves are delicate as well as the pattern throughout the sweater. it fits true to size. i would wear it open with a colorful tank underneath. perhaps if you are very tall and very thin you may opt to hook it closed. the sizing is perfect, it flows and i really have to say you must see this in person to really appreciate"
1,"Great casual sweater, runs big I originally saw the sweater in one of the stores. it really is much nicer in person than online. i decided to try it on while there but was looking for other items, not sweaters then. i normally wear between xs and s depending on the brand. well, even the xs was too big. i thought i'd order it in a petite size since i am short but forgot about it once i got home with some other retailer items. i eventually did search it out but the xs petite was already sold out. i ordered the xxs?this fits but i"
0,Disappointed with fit This is one of those dresses that looks so cute on the model but doesn't look anything like that in reality. it has no shape and it fits weirdly all over. i am normally a m and i ordered the s and it is massive.
1,"Nice cardigan, odd colors I ordered this for my mom in color ""blue motif"". i could not see a difference online between the colors ""brown motif"" and ""blue motif"" - both looked grey to me. in real life blue motif looks grey with a very light bluish tinge to it. it looks like grey wool and light grey-bluish fiber was interwoven, but you have to look very closely to see that. i guess i would have prefered a pure white or cream color but that is a matter ot your pesonal taste i guess. the cardigan style is an oversized one. t"
1,Gorgeous!! Easy breezy summer dress!!! love the detailing under the arms!!!
1, Comfy and lightweight - beautiful blue color. sleeves are a bit long but not a bother to me.
1,"Wear for years to come I love hess overalls. they are true to size and have a great vintage look to them but done in a classic way. i am 5'6"" 125lbs and a 34b. i bought the xs and it fit great! they are fitted and not sloppy like a lot of overalls. you can easily dress them up or down. soft and stretchy material is a plus"
1,Tight in chest area My bra size is a 36 c. i got the medium and the dress buttoned looked nothing like the model... the top button barely buttoned....
1,"Comfortable tunic, yet fashionable and edgy This is a a great piece.   i tried it on in denim and went out and ordered the red checked print.  this was so cute!   i loved it in the red checked and then ordered the denim.   it can be dressed up or down.  it is comfortable and there is an edgy quality to the look.  you can wear heals and a statement necklace and it really is dressed up.  order a size down and it works well.  thank you retailer!!"
1," These leggings are gorgeous. soft suede feel, perfect fit, great look, especially for dressing up and going out. love them."
1,Surprise! I just received this in the green color. it is a true medium jade green. my monitor shows a blue color and that is what i expected. the green is pretty but i would have preferred the blue that was shown. i found this to fit large . the pockets that are barely visible in any of the photos gape open and don't lie flat. i do like this sweater as a very casual jacket alternative on cooler days. the cashmere is a nice weight and is not too precious to wear every day with jeans.
1,"Pretty,pretty I never noticed this sweater online but when i saw it in the store, it was love at first sight. i agree with other reviewers that the color description is odd. the brown is a very pale gray and the blue is a light mint green. the sweater is very delicate looking and fits true to size. the sleeves are very long, covering my hands, and i have long arms. it does have enough body to make a large roll at the cuff. i do have a couple of issues that aren't related specifically to this sweater: even tho"
1,"Amazingly amazing This dress is gorgeous. it looks exactly as it appears on model. the model must be wearing a petite because the regular size dress is maxi length on anyone 5'8. the petite is midi length and is perfect every where else. i am not petite, but this petite worked perfect on me for midi length.
pros of dress
the dress has nice light float fabric, with colorblind on bottom for a touch of modern.
the dress looks very dowton abby and the vintage look is hard to find now days in dress.
the dress looks fa"
1,"Flowwy, comfortable, feminine I love this tank! its something you can dress up with a skirt, or wear over jeans. i like loose fitting tops, although i have a slender frame. this is also so comfortable. i went with a size medium, and it fits perfect."
1,Beautiful and bright I love the color of this cardigan and the cashmere is very soft. i love the detail in the stitching and how the zipper is covered. i do wish it were a bit longer but it's definitely a keeper.
1,"Simply gorgeous!! Just bought this top today at our local store. it's just gorgeous on. i'm a 34dd and bought the size small and it fits perfectly. if you're small chested, you can probably size down as it runs nice and full for a larger bust. it's so feminine and pretty on. a must for any wardrobe."
1,"Just what i needed! I recently noticed that my trusty black cardigan, that i've had for years, was getting thin in the elbows and just kind of ragged, so out i went on the long journey to find the perfect cardigan with detail. this cardigan fit the bill, with a perfect fit and lovely texture, making it not just your average sweater, to go with my style. can't say anything bad about it!"
1,"This dress is perfect for summer! This dress was love at first sight.  i did have to size down from my normal size but the dress is so comfortable and cool.  as another reviewer said, it does shrink after first wash but perfect now since i am 5'2"".  it shrank about one inch in length only.  i got many compliments and my husband said it was beautiful- that's a plus! i was comfortable and cool all day.  get it before it is out of stock.  this dress will not make it to sale."
1,"Gorgeous dress, recommend for slimmer individuals I love this dress! my bra straps do not show in the back. you can slightly see them in the front but wearing black or nude gets you around this problem. i love the slim design-it is very flattering. i tried this is my normal size 4 but also the 4 petite. the petite did not work for me since there is a larger fabric cutout for the butt area-this was too high and above my natural waste. because of this, i opted for the slightly longer option where the extra fabric was surrounding my bum. this does"
1, The most amazingly versatile cardi you'll ever own! it goes with everything from boyfriend jeans and booties to black chiffon pleated skirt. it's soft and feminine and makes you feel like you look like a million dollars! definitely worth the price.
1,Perfect fit This is a beautiful top which runs tts and armholes are not too big for once. i typically struggle with armholes being way too big on me and have to size down in most tops and this top runs tts and armholes are perfect. no bra showing beneath. yay! it is a beautiful color and design. just love it. i am a typical size 4/6 and size 6 was perfect. i am 36c and no problems in bust area. works well with my short torso. highly recommend. i think it will look great on all body types.
1,"Adorable for work or weekend The color pattern in this material pops a lot more in person than on the website. fits perfectly, very versatile regardless of the occasion or the season (at least in california!). love it."
1," This is the most beautiful dress! so many beautiful patterns, the zipper across the front and belt across the front is so flattering and sexy. beautiful flower applique on the hips. everything about this dress is magnificent!"
1,"Beautiful dress, strange fit I have to agree with people who are saying this dress runs small in the hips. even a size 0 is typically roomy on me when it comes to dresses at retailer, but a size 4 in this would have been best on my hips. the size 2 was just a smidge too tight looking and loose on the upper half of my body, which made my waist look thicker than it is, i thought. my boyfriend disagreed and thought it looked nice, but i still didn't buy because my life would not give me many opportunities to wear this thing anyw"
1,Classic Loving this jumpsuit! i normally a medium top small bottom i bought the medium it fits right. soft fabric and nice color.
0,Too boxy It's not as form fitting & hour-glass shaped in real life as on the model. i think they must have clipped it in the small of her back so it does not look so boxy. otherwise it's nice.
0,"Disappointed When i wore this the two times i did, i got a ton of compliments. it runs small, and is a bit tight when sized correctly but its really stunning. after the second wear, the fabric under the arms frayed and its now unwearable. i have to return it and am so disappointed. sadly, i would not recommend buying it for that reason."
0, I ordered 2 dressed in 2 different sizes. neither fit... both were very tight... runs very small.
1, I love the design of this shirt - very flattering fit. very soft and great as a layering piece.
1,"Very vintage! This sweater caught my eye months ago, and i recently picked it up on sale at a great price. it reminds me of something betty draper would wear on mad men; it has a fabulous 1960s feel to it. and, everyone loves pockets! i love the combination of peachy pink and cream, and the sweater it quite warm. the fit is good, although on me, the buttons gap slightly (this is easily remedied by wearing a shirt underneath, as shown on the model). i'm already dreaming up lots of fun outfit combinations!"
1,"Beautiful color and fit This dress fits very nicely, i didn't keep it as i have too many dresses, but loved the fit. hip was a little looser compared to the top, you can almost see it on the model if you look closely, the dies poke out a bit. the teal color is very flattering on my pale skin tone. love the back, you can actually zip it all the way (mid back) with the tie in the neck, leaving a nice cutout... 0p fit me (115 lbs, 26.5 in waist) 30 dd)."
1,Lovely coins in a fountain This precious skirt is a treasure chest of soft bronze fabric circles scattered like coins at the bottom of a fountain. the circles are a bronze color and cannot be felt through the skirt net. it's finely finished and simply a nice piece for dinner out or a day in the office. i received many compliments on my first wearing.
1,"Runs big on top Beautiful dress but the fit was off for me. overall this is good quality with beautiful lace detail. as the other reviewer mentioned the cutout in the back is very cute. i wanted to love this dress but i found it to run large in the top. i'm 5'6 130lb with 34c and i ordered the small, the top just hung off of me. perhaps it would have been better with an xs."
1,"Lovely holiday dress! I can't say enough good things about this piece. high quality in structure and design. when i initially put it on i worried that i might have ordered a size too small. so i was pleasantly surprised to realize this dress fits like a glove but has enough give in all of the right places to let you eat, dance, breath, etc. i received tons of compliments.
of note, i am 128 lbs and 5/5 - i wore a size 4.
wanting another event that i can wear this to as i wore it to a work xmas party."
1,"Lovely! This has a wonderful texture and feel to it. the leather dots are supple, and the tulle is soft and flowey. it's long, more like a midi skirt, and the color is more towards taupe than ivory.
with a shimmer, this skirt is very fun to wear."
1,"Great shirt I love this shirt and although it is see through a tank works great under it to wear to work. the buttons on the back are sewn on really well and it comes down far enough/ is not too short. i am about 5'4"" and 100 pounds. the 00 was tight on my neck so i kept a 0. otherwise the 00 would have fit fine since its a blousy shirt and would not have been too tight in the shoulders or armpits."
1,Great top I bought this top in taupe and love the style. it's not too boxy or long. cotton is always a plus and i just wish there were more colors.
1,"Darling! This is beautiful and the leather metallic circles are sewn on really well, i checked a bunch of them because initially that was my concern that one would get caught on someone's clothes. the 6 fits perfect (5'9 and 140 lbs). goes really well with the dark denim shirt that they displayed in store. definitely a fun piece for the holiday season."
1,"Love it! I adore this skirt - it is so soft and flowy. i was not sure if the mesh would be a bit stiff, but it's not at all. the dots are soft as is the main fabric. i could wear this all day long and be very comfy. the underlying fabric is a bit more taupe than gold in color. i am between sizes to i sized up and was glad i did- no pinch at the waist. i love that it's feminine yet funky and could be worn formally or in fun. it is midi-length, as you see on the model. absolutely a great buy!"
0,"Pretty but tight in rear Pretty fabric, nice style, took it back."
0,"Weird fit Dress looks beautiful, but the fitting is very off. i ordered a size 2 which is the dress size i usually wear ( i'm 5;4 and 115lbs). the chest area fits perfectly, but the hip area is extremely tight and the lower back area was lose. i exchanged it for a 4, the hip area was a bit tight and the shoulders were too lose. if i ordered the 4p, i have a feeling it would be too tight. it feels like, it's meant for someone with very small hips and a large abdomen. also, this dress is very stiff, can't d"
0,Love the look Overall construction/craftmanship of skirt is poor- the dots were sewn in on the seam- some dots didn't lay flat on side by seam- looked like some dots were missing around the top part of skirt in back- ( very disappointed in the quality from retailer- my last 3 or so orders have been similar complaints with their items- sad!!!)
1,"Beautiful sweater This sweater looks alot better in person. the picture online doesn't do it justice. this can be used both as a sweater or even like a lightweight jacket. a very versatile piece added to the wardrobe. definitely worth the markdown price!
only con, is that it has some fluffy pieces in the yarn that comes loose on wearing and sticks to other fabric. so wearing it with black pants might cause a problem."
1,"Finally on sale! I had four weddings this fall and tried this dress on but ended up not purchasing because i already had dresses to wear. but, i told myself i would purchase the dress if it ever went on sale. i don't have an occasion to wear it yet but i can't wait! the dress is so lovely and the details are beautiful. the only thing i'm worried about is the possibility for some of the embroidered parts to pill. it looks very flattering and hugs all my curves beautifully."
1," This is a beautiful dress. the detail is amazing, but it runs a little small. i'm usually size 0, but i had to go up a size in this dress. its cut a little too tight, and there is no give in the fabric. otherwise its stunning!"
1,"Gorgeous dress!! I bought this for a wedding i will attend 10 months from now. when i saw this dress on sale, i just need to get it! it was simply gorgeous!!! it fitted so well. it makes one feel so special. i like the addition of the belt."
1,"So cute! Most casual tops are so sloppy now - not this one! great cut, wish there were more color options."
1,"Lovely This skirt manages to be both sophisticated and whimsical. it's well-made, classy, feminine, and timeless. love it!"
1,"Awesome I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this shirt. it's comfortable, the fit is excellent and flattering, and it can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. i bought it in the brown and the black and have no regrets."
1,"Beautiful dress and design The dress is very beautiful and looks expensive. it will make a nice wedding dress. it does run quite small though. i am 5'2"" and 90-95lbs with a straight figure, but the 00p was too constricting."
1,"Stunning: a timeless piece of artistry! Wow, this dress is so incredibly designed and made! the style is a subtle showstopper - classic and beautiful like they don't make anymore.
the inside of the dress is so well constructed, it has its own beauty!

i read that it ran a little large, so i tried the 0 and the 00, since i usually wear a 0. well the 00 looked like a lingerie commercial with the dress unable to zip above the waist!! the 0 fit and zipped, but i could not sit down comfortably. yikes!
the 2 was a winner. i'm 5'4 1/2"", 110"
1,"Awesome I love this skirt. unfortunately, no petite sizing was available when it was affordable (on sale). i purchased the 6 regular (based on ""small waist"" reviews) thinking i'll just have it shortened. did not realize there are 4 layers and tailoring would have cost $60+. was considering anyway, but when pinned up, the skirt lost its fullness and i didn't care for that look. if anyone has a 6 petite they want to off-load or exchange with me for a 6 regular, am very happy to do so. this is one skirt i"
1,"Beautifully subtle, charming, & tad small waist You've probably read through the other reviews, so i'll try not to repeat too much:
__________
pros:
- it is lightweight and flows beautifully, flattering every sort of shape and frame.
- the leather circles throughout are darling and seem to be fairly secure (some of mine were a bit bent upon receipt).
- the color is subtle yet not understated. it just works. not sheer, lining throughout that isn't itchy and some tulle on top of the lining to give it a bounce and fuller shape.
- color is more t"
1," These coveralls are not cut long enough, i am long in the body and it is very hard for me to find coveralls overalls that are long enough and these unfortunately are the same. i have large breast so that adds to the problem so when i stand sideways and look at the waistband the front you can see is pulled up where the back is hanging lower. they really are nice, my first thought when i put them kn was wow i look a tad like michael myers in them but they're really very cool.....wish i could keep"
1,"Stunning dress odd fit I did not have to size up or down because of my body type (broad padded back, wide rib cage, narrow hips, small bum.) however, it fits a little odd on me. the back darts that start at the waist and are supposed to curve for your behind settle too high and wrinkle. the waist is also too high. the shoulders are a bit tight. i am confused because i bought the exact same size pieced brocade (the colorful version of this dress) and that one actually fits spot on. i have a feeling if i go to the store"
0," What a huge dissippointment when this arrived home.....

the sleeves are very long and very boxy...
i have no idea the condition of this on store, but came with damages on sleeves also, we can tell that was something wrong and i was surprise that retailer sent me something like that, i'm a customer here for a very long time!!!!

dissipointed!!!! ;("
1,"Shimmer spot skirt I'm 5'6"" about 120 and usually a 0/2 in retailer... the size 2 in this skirt fit at my natural waist perfectly with enough room to move comfortably. on the hanger and from the photo i didn't think i'd like it, but once on it's really pretty and the fabric looks so nice, it has great movement, and is really flattering."
1,"Love, love, love! Unique and stylish dress, looks much better on than in the pictures."
1," I bought this dress to wear at a bridal shower and absolutely love it! the color was perfect and the petite-xs was true to its size. the top was a bit on the tight side with my arms but overall incredibly comfortable. i would buy more in this style and size, but not having enough occasions to wear the style. it's great for wedding guests, cocktail hours, or even work."
1,"Color This is a classic pencil dress that would be becoming on most straight figures. i always wear a 6 (or medium) in hd, and this dress is a little large everywhere. i love it so much, i paid full price and i will probably have it taken in on the sides if possible. the lacework is gorgeous and sturdy - it doesn't catch on stuff. there is a lot of give to sit and move in, unlike most pencil dresses, and i cannot say enough about the color. wow, heads turn when you walk into a room in this gorgeous de"
1,"Beautiful! Saw this skirt in the store, but the size was wrong. i am normally a 0 or 2 at retailer, but i was afraid that the 2 would be just too much material, so i ordered the 0, and boy, am i glad.
elegant, can go from day to night with the right shoes and accessories.
anticipating many compliments."
1,"Perfect spring top This is such a cute little top that can be easily worn off the shoulder or on the shoulders. it is comfortable, soft and quite flattering. it hangs nicely and is a pretty white top that will come in handy this spring and summer. i stayed tts on this one but could have sized down."
1,"Lovely.... Wonderful summer blouse!. prefect with jeans or shorts. very flattering on my older, curvy body."
1," The most important thing to note about this skirt is that it is a true blue color- not black! it's also perfect for spring , summer and early fall. super comfy, casual yet elegant. size runs a tiny bit small as the waist is not elasticized. a staple of a cozy chic wardrobe."
1,In love I am so in love with this top. can be worn on or off the shoulders. the color is amazing!
1,Great shirt I'm always on the search for a comfortable shirt with style. this does not disappoint. super comfy and flattering. love.
0,Quality questionable The purple/cobalt is a beautiful color. i feel the t shirt material is entirely too thin for the price.
1,"Like but flaws for me I saw the ""blue"" version in my store (a return) in size 0. i decided to try it on and i loved it. it fit nicely, was comfortable and soft and the colors were flattering (and cut). (115 lbs, 30 dd, 26.5 in waist), i contemplated purchasing, as i thought it was a bit pricey, but usually i order petite versions. and it wasn't available in that size, until it was. and i ordered it. it came and the fit of that one was great in the legs, much nicer than regular, but the top part was a bit small. the a"
1,"Perfect tee I had been looking for a tee to wear under a kimono i bought last year at retailer. the cut out slub tee was the perfect tee. the slate color goes well with the colors in the kimono, along with being a good neutral. this is also a good tee to wear alone with a pair of jeans as it hangs nicely."
1,"Can dress up or down Very soft, comfortable piece that can be worn casually with jeans and a tee or over a blouse or sheath dress for work. i like the 3/4 length sleeves and pockets"
1,"Super cute Very comfortable and super cute. the top sold out, which i'm bummed about, but matched it with a funky black top."
1, Like most retailer clothes this runs large. nice design & comfort.
0, Kinda a boxy looking sweater. it definitely made me look really large and just couldn't see myself wearing it very often. ended up returning it.
1,"The tee that goes with everything I have worn this to work, errands, yoga. it's a great tee. love it!"
1,"Didn't work for me, but it is beautiful This skirt didn't fit me right--i'm 5'6"" and the hem hit too low, making for a frumpy rather than classic look. the fabric and color are lovely, however, and on a taller person this could be beautiful. the draping is beautiful and slimming."
1,"Cute tees I first saw this tees paired with a skirt (blue and white stripes on the website). i immediately like the unique shape around the shoulder, v-neck line with a gap to the sleeves. even the color is white, it looks very appealing to me, simple yet unique. i bought the tees in white and black colors. i expected the white one to be sheer, but not the black one. even with a nude bra, i can slightly see the bra shape inside the tees. the size is running large. i usually wear size s with retailer. i got"
1,"Love this top I love this top, beautiful soft fabric , much prettier than picture, can be worn on or off shoulders. extremely flattering, falls to a perfect length , great with shorts, pants or a long skirt."
1,"Great top- bottoms run super small - order up Great fun pattern. sexy styling. the other reviewers commented on how the trim is white and the body is ivory- i actually liked that. i am 5'4"" and 120 lbs. i usually wear a 4 and ordered a medium in this suit. bottom was super small and is sold out in large so i had to return it"
1,"Nice shirt Love the style of this shirt. its flattering and light material, good for all weather and layering."
1,"Most flattering jeans! Most flattering and perfect dark skinny jean! obsessed is an understatement. i am becoming a big fan of mother denim! just enough stretch to be comfortable all day, sit a little bit higher on my waist, which is wonderful (post babies) and sometimes hard to find in jeans. if you are in between sizes, be sure to size down! these jeans are stretchy to begin with and will stretch out a whole size. i have never been happier with a pair of jeans!"
1," The colors are vibrant and the beading is beautifully simple and nicely done. i waited quite a few months for this dress but it was worth the wait! it's loose fitting, but still gives you some shape without looking like you are wearing a potato sack!"
1,"Indecisive I haven't worn the top yet nor have i returned it. still not sure if i want to keep it! i bought the slate color and it is a bland color. also, not sure if i like the fabric because the material feels like it could be a pajama top! however, it is a comfortable loose fitting top so for that reason, i may keep it."
1,Fun summer top This top is too cute and shows just the right amount of skin without being overt. it can be worn on or off the shoulder and is just enough to cover a tummy without looking maternity. i can't wait for the warmer weather to get here and stay so i can wear this top more often!
1,Trendy simplicity This shirt is a great way to rock the off the shoulder trend. you can dress it up or down bi would definitely recommend it.
1,"Happy I'm happy with the sweater. while one reviewer reports returning it for being too small, i agree with another who found the sweater- especially the arms- too roomy."
1, Great tee! flows well and very soft. true to size!
1,Beautiful dress This dress is a bit longer than photographed but i was totally ok with that. the skirt is also a bit fuller which makes the dress more formal. it's really well made and great material. i'm 5'6 123lb and bought a size 4.
1," Love this shirt! i have it in both colors. you can wear it off the shoulder or on. it's baggy enough it looks great with skinny jeans, i recently had a double mastectomy and wore this shirt a lot as it is baggy enough, you couldn't see i had drains underneath my tank top. i am really grateful for this shirt! super soft, super cute!"
0,"Boxy and billowy Ordered this in xl- i usually am between l and xl. i'm 5'9"" and thought it was cropped, boxy, and billowy around the midsection that was not flattering. the fabric is light and is less like a blazer, more like a cardigan."
1," I was looking for a simplistic dress because i am graduating in a few weeks but did not really want to purchase anything. i strolled in the store and this immediately caught my eye. i tried it on and fell in love!! it fits perfectly and it is the right length. i love the bust line and the detailing of the straps in the back. i don't think i feel as though i am going to a wedding,but i will feel beautiful especially since this is really big deal and accomplishment. i am an older adult - so i want"
1, I love this shirt. i have it in red. i found the fit tts and looks great casually with a scarf or dressed up with a nice necklace. you can't go wrong with a cute shirt that is soft. i like the length goes just past my bottom in the back but not overwhelming.
1,"Great summer shirt! I purchased the blue color and it's gorgeous. i'm 5'7"" and the length is perfect, not too billowy and not too tight. the fabric is a nice gauzy, summer weight."
1,"Lovely but very full This dress is really beautiful, but the fullness of the skirt made it a bit too precious for me. i liked that the neckline isn't too low, i could wear a bra with straps with it, the knee-length hem is perfect and the back is beautiful. but the skirt is really princessy. might work for a bridesmaid or an evening occasion but i found it too shiny and girly for less formal events."
1,"Give me more art dept, please... I just adore these shorts from art dept. they are casual, yet slightly structured. the length is just perfect (for me), no ride up, no wrinkles (i can't stand wrinkled shorts), and the fringe gives these shorts a fun and playful look just perfect for a stroll on the beach or shopping with your girlfriends. i know these shorts are going to be a staple in my summer wardrobe for years. can i have these in more colors and patterns too????"
1,"Colorful, comfy pants Ordered these pants in an xs (5'5, 110lbs) -- they fit well in the waist, but are quite long so i roll the waist band down once. they are super fun & funky - i mainly plan to wear them around my house so i don't mind rolling the waist band. if i were going to wear them out, i'd probably have to pair with heels as they are a few inches too long. light & airy material perfect for summer, & cute detail on the pocket seams too."
1,"Don't let the stock photo deter you! I saw this in the store and fell in love with it! i normally wear between a 29 and 30 in pants and the medium fit great. it is a very generous cut in the leg and the waist has an elastic band in the back. i'm 5'5"" and the pants almost graze the top of my foot, perfect for sandals. if i had seen this stock photo first i would have been totally off-put by the culotte length, but i guess that's what it looks like on a model! there are cute buttons that run down the outside length of the pants and t"
1,"Wonderful spring/summer addition! I first saw this shirt online and decided to see it in person. so happy i did! i never would have picked it up in the store. it looks much better on than on the hanger. it is so flattering! you can wear it on or off the shoulders and although it is a boxy shirt, it somehow makes you look slim! wow! i took my usual medium. highly recommend!"
1, These shorts are really cute but i felt like they were a little too short for me so i ended up returning them and i purchased the dress by the same brand instead.
0,"Disappointing I was expecting a tunic with a bit of structure and weight to layer over leggings, with boots, etc.

this is just an oversized turtleneck - there's nothing special about it. it's thin material. nothing to justify the price.

the sizing seems odd. i'm normally a 2 on the top and 4 on the bottom. the xs was huge up top (i was swimming in it - much larger than it appears in pictures on the model) and spanned across my hips (more than the model).

even if i could find a size that worked, there was n"
1, Fits loose good material. will buy in other colors.
1,"So pretty!! I bought this top in the purple color but i believe it to be more of a cobalt. it is a beautiful color! i wore it to dinner the same night i purchased it. my husband said he loved the color and style. i wear either a s or m in retailer tops, depending on the brand. with this one i chose a small and it's fits perfectly. i have a petite frame; 5'2"", 123 lbs., but with a 32f bust. it is very flattering, as with most off the shoulder tops. they say your shoulders never age :) the length is just right"
1,"Sleek and chic! I l o v e this sleeveless blouse for is soft tranquil print, wearability from day to night, comfort and fit! the design is flirty yet sophisticated-i wear it with skirts for work and jeans by night. can't say enough good things! everyone should have this beautiful piece in their wardrobe!"
1,"Love I ordered this dress to wear to a mid summer evening wedding. i love it. i think it will be fun, and it is unexpected for me. i will need to order a smaller size.i am 5'-5"" and almost always wear a 4 in retailer wear. this ran a little big on the top, i will be ordering a 2 and sending one back"
1,"Great, fun t-shirt Love these basic t's because there is always a unique cut out which makes them more interesting. fit and wash well."
1,"Beautiful color I purchased this in the ""purple"" which is more blue than purple, but you can definitely see the purplish hue depending on the light. it's a beautiful, rich indigo color. it's very comfortable. i usually go for more fitted styles, but i was pleasantly surprised at how flattering this top is even though the body of the shirt is more loose fitting. i'm very excited to wear this top this summer. i haven't worn and washed it yet, so i am hoping the color and material will hold up after washing. i am"
1," I think the fabric is very nice and soft. i find this top runs very large. i am 5'2"" 130l. normally wear a small in a shirt. i should have ordered xs it is very large. i actually looked to see if they sent me the wrong size. the shoulder area fits fine. i may try tucking it in. other than size a nice top."
1,"Misnomer in color, stunning on any figure I'm not sure why they call this ""black"" because what you see in this pictures depicted is pretty much the shade in person. the fabric itself is lovely. it made my wider hips look smaller! :)

___________
pros:
- drapes beautifully on the body, especially for curvier gals.
- not black but a deep navy/velvet look and feel.
- very forgiving and stretchy.
- perfect length in front and back.
- hides imperfections wonderfully.
- soft, flows well, and unique!

cons:
- material is thin, not for winter a"
1," Best jumpsuit ever! so soft and always gets compliments! get one now before they're gone. also it is supposed to be tied in front! i'm 5'3"" and the small petite is just perfect!"
1," Great little spring top. the fabric is soft and the drape is of the fabric is just right. it is very loose without making it look like a maternity top and the length hits me right at the top of the hipbone. for reference i am in my 50's, 5'1"" and weigh in the150's. i normally wear medium size and this one was no exception. the blue is a beautiful cobalt color."
1,Great staple I am super happy with the t-shirt....it fits true to size and the cut outs are a great detail!! i'm thinking about buying another!!
1,"The pleats in this jacket are unruly Despite the fact that this jacket is made from a gorgeous ottoman looking knit fabric, and has perfect fit, nice arm length, looks good on the hanger, the jacket did me no justice at all. it arrived folded, in the mail, so i had to press down the unruly pleats before i could try it on (you have to do this with nearly every item you buy online that comes folded flat and stuck in a cellophane bag.). so i pressed the jacket, tried to neaten the pleats but to no avail. the pleats would not stay put"
1,"Not true to size, but beautiful This shirt looked so perfect on the model, and i was so excited to get it! when i received it, it was so soft and the color was so vibrant. the only thing is, it's too big. it kind of looks like a maternity shirt. it will definitely have to be taken in on the sides for me, but i'm happy with it other than that. i'm normally a l/xl but m would have been perfect this time."
1,"Stunning blouse Even on sale i was hesitant about paying so much for a blouse, but i'm so happy i did! the fabric looks as high quality in-person as it does in the picture, and it isn't see-through. the main color of the top is less powder pink and more nude in my opinion, but the color is lovely and the various purples and grays of the arrow details really pop. the buttons down the back are a fun, cute detail, and tone down the more professional look of this blouse in order to wear it with jeans for going out."
1,"Great style; runs small Love the pattern on this lightweight cardigan and it is super flattering. i tried ordering the xs/s first because the next size up just sounded too big, but i ultimately had to order up for more room in shoulders and length in arms, though. i'm hoping the m/l fits without too much spare fabric because it really is a great piece."
0," So this is a great tee, problem is the white you can see through. i an not looking for a layering tee so not what i was looking for."
0,"Too sheer I loved the way this shirt looked when i tried it on in the store buto when i got home i realized it's extremely sheer. you can't wear a white bra with it, for example because it will show through. taking it back."
1,Great jumper! Picked this up at the store in my usual size small. it fit perfectly. i am a 34d and the buttons closed with no gap. the length was just above the ankle and the fit is slim. so comfy. my guess is this is going to sell out because everyone including the sa's wanted to buy one. loved the color too~very versatile.
1,"Amazing, versatile piece for spring and summer I picked this up unexpectedly and whisked it into the dressing room a long with a handful of other things today.
i noticed right away how soft it was! so comfy! i have never owned a romper before so i wasn't expecting to like it--- i was so wrong, i'm sorry romper! i love you!
