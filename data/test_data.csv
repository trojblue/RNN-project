1,"Very comfortable and flattering These pants are extremely comfortable and flattering. i bought them in coral, and wore with a black peasant top, sandals and a long necklace. they do stretch out a lot though, so i would recommend sizing down. i bought mine to look like they fit on the model, and after a few hours they were hanging off of me, so buy them a little bit tighter than you like. the drawstring is purely decorative and does not tighten the waist."
1," The is a cute dress with a great pattern and nice material. it would look great on the right kind of figure. i'm 5'7"" and slim, but at thirteen weeks pregnant and not showing, the skirt made me look about thirty weeks pregnant, but the top fit just fine."
1,"Great fitting pants! Love these pants i bought them in two colors! flattering fitting!! im 5'4 120lbs 36"" hip. i bought these in size 25. sometimes i don't like petit sizing but these petite at 30"" long inseam still gave me enough length to wear with heals. there is the usual good and bad with linen - after you wear them once you need to iron because they look too wrinkled and worn. the linen is light and washed - unfortunately i don't think these pants will hold up for more than a two years. i'll love them while i"
0,"Kind of blah Got this in the moss color. i throw on a hoodie almost every day to walk my dog so i justified the high price. returned it because it was not cute on. the waffle fabric didn't stand out, and the bottom just hung straight. i thought it would be more ruffle-like. even on sale i won't buy it ~ it's just that blah"
1,"Awesome beach dress/coverup Just received this dress today. i bought it for a vacation we are taking to mexico. i wanted a nice coverup.
this is beautiful. fits nicely without looking like a tent.
i would highly recommend. 
this is one size fits all."
1," Is it just me? i love these pants i bought them in 2 sizes. first my normal size and then down one size because although they fit perfect in the store, with in a hour of wearing them around the house, they had stretched out so much that i could not keep them up. so i purchased the smaller size (same color) and they stretched out just like the first pair. so disappointing. i took them to my seamstress and she took them in 2 inches in the waist and now at least i can wear them all day. not sure if"
1," Love this sweater.. fits perfect, flattering and soft. i got it in both colors. it is a true staple!"
1,"Comfy This jumpsuit is very comfortable. the material is soft the waist is elasticised, it is not drawstring as it seems in the photos."
1,"So flattering A perfect go-to top. looks great with jeans - dark , faded or bright white. top it with a cardigan or wear it bare - it offers a flattering fit with its high-quality, textured fabric. i normally wear a small or medium top. an extra-small fits me perfectly."
1,"Dotted fleur dress - black Absolutely love this dress. maeve dresses have always been constructed with great care and quality. i am and always have been a size med in maeve dresses. the dress is soft and flowing. the fabric is very forgiving and moves with you. i recommend trying on a dress by this maker . . . their cuts are consistent, so i feel extremely confident in buying their clothes online. this is a keeper and can be worn year round."
1,"My favorite new piece! The photos do not do this skirt justice! i'm so glad i picked it up in the store, as i would not have given it a second look online. it is soft, stretchy, forgiving, and one of the most versatile pieces in my closet! i dressed it up for an evening event and can't wait to throw it on with a tee and jean jacket! love it!"
0,"I really want to love these... I see all the amazing reviews and on one hand, i agree with them. but these pants do run huge and they don't fit tailored like on the model. on me, they fit loose around the legs and thighs and they're super wrinkly. you'll have to iron these after every wear and every wash. i'm surprised to see the comment saying they're wrinkle resistant. they aren't. also, the kahki is more grey which i don't love. i got these on sale, but even at $50 i just can't justify keeping them. they're super comfy but"
1,"Not for the tall... This is a super cute romper--very casual, very comfortable. i feel it runs a bit big because i tried on an xs (i'm usually a small 4-6). it fit perfectly except for the inseam on the legs. i am 5' 8.5"" tall but mostly legs (as opposed to being long waisted). i wear a 33"" inseam with flats. if the bottom of the legs were not elasticized, i could have just gone with a cropped look or rolled them, etc. but the elastic was digging into my calves after just five minutes. i think it might be very unco"
1,"This shirt looks amazing When i first saw the bees embroidered pullover in the store, it instantly caught my attention. since it was pricey, i didn't get it. when it went on sale, it ran out in my size. so recently i was fortunate enough to get the same style embroidered birds pullover in the store for 20% off the sale price. this shirt looks so adorable on and is different than the typical sweatshirt."
1,"So flattering, no need for petite I just tried this top on in xs regular even though i generally wear xspetite in retailer and it fit great (34aa - 26 - 34). i think it's flattering on my fairly straight body with the halter neck, fitted waist and peplum. i would guess it would be flattering on many body types; it highlights shoulders beautifully. it was very hard to get my head through the small, not-too-stretchy opening so you may want to try it on without makeup. i knocked off one star because the neck band wasn't symmetrical,"
1,"Like fancy pjs I love everything about this jumper - it's so comfortable without being too warm. it's easy to dress up with booties and a hat. i suppose the only possible downside is that it's slightly tight at the ankles, but honestly - this is like a dream."
1,"Nice romper This is adorable! i got it to wear on the plane for an upcoming vacation. this is definitely tts. i am normally a medium and got the medium. i am long wasted and this fit just fine. looks like it does on the model.
the material is super soft too. it is also easy to get on and off which is sometimes difficult with rompers.
plan on wearing it with gladiator sandals and a jean jacket."
1,Comfortable! This jumpsuit is so so comfy i can't wait to wear it! def runs on the large size.
1,"Great fit and weight This skirt fits great. the thick material helps it lay nicely and smooth the curves. i'm 5-4"" about 130lbs, athletic build with a bottom and the med fit well."
1," I loved this top so much, i ended up buying both of the designs. they are so cute and eye catching, and the layered look is really fun. it fit me very well."
0,"Cute skirt, bad quality I ordered this skirt in a size small and when i received it, not only was it too long, but there was also a hole in it. so i returned it. when a small petite became available, i ordered it thinking it would fit better. i just received it and there is a hole in this skirt as well. both skirts also looked as if they had been worn; there was fuzz and lint all over the skirts. i like the skirt but i either have extremely bad luck or it's really bad quality."
1,"Summer staple I am so happy with this jumpsuit! it is the perfect comfortable and casual summer outfit. the fabric is super soft. i was unsure about the length at first because it's shorter than my other jumpsuits, but if you scrunch up the bottom of the legs and add some sandals, it's a great look. 
highly recommend!"
1,"Cute and good quality, but fit issues Pros: material is amazing, super soft and quality thickness (but not like uber this, just enough, it will last). also seems like it won't wrinkle much which would make it a great dress to throw in a bag for a trip. fits well in the shoulders, chest and the length is good.

cons: the ""waist"" line is really tight and really really high. i'm 5'8"", 150lbs and my usual medium is pretty tight. of course it hits me on the rib cage too, which is so weird. it's way higher than it should be.

i'll pro"
1,"Great style and fit I finally broke down and went on a christmas shopping spree at retailer for myself with hubby in tow as they are gifts from him.
the skirt is a beautiful dark navy, super soft knit. very long with a texture pattern. i am 5'9"" and have put on a few pounds lately but typical wear and 8/10 and bought the large because i didn't want to try it on. it works for me because i don't like skirts to cling to much. even my pencil skirts i like a more loose fit. normally id say a medium would probably f"
1,"Great summer dress I adore this dress. it has a fairly thick material, which helps the skirt stay full and is very flattering if, like me, your thighs or tummy can be a problem area in dresses! the only downside for me is the fact that i have fairly narrow shoulders, so the seam for the sleeves tends to stick out a bit! i get lots of compliments on this one!"
1,"Love it so much! This jumpsuit is so, so cute. i tried it on in an xs in store but needed a petite. i ordered the xsp online, received it, but honestly it's still a little big. the xxsp is sold out, but i love the piece so much i think i'm going to have it taken in. trust me, it's just as cute as it looks, if not cuter!"
0,Not flattering if you have thighs! I am not particularly large but i have thighs! this pair of pants was totally unflattering! my butt looked fine but everything else looked bigger and my legs looked like stumps. i now understand why it's on sale. you may like these pants if you are tall and thin legged. but otherwise skip them. plus the material seems like it would discolor or stain easily. i had a pair from retailer in the same material last year that developed an odd discoloration the first time i wore them.
1,"Great casual weekend or sahm shirt I'm a stay at home mom, always on the lookout for something casual, interesting, yet put together. it's preppy yet quirky with the embroidery. i love this shirt. great with jeans, can take you from shopping to playground and lunch without feeling under or overdressed anywhere. the sparkle from the embroidered birds gives it spunk to not make it look too boring and predictable. at the same time, it isn't something that screams, look at me! a perfect mix."
1,"Great summer pant I don't have anything like these pants so was thrilled to purchase the coral. i found the pants ran slightly large, though i stuck with my regular 28"" and they are very comfortable."
1,"Beautiful, flattering pants I tried these on in the store today and fell in love. they fit/drape beautifully and are incredibly comfortable while looking stylish. i'm 5'7"" and 128 lbs. and the 27 (a 4, i guess) fit perfectly. sadly, i can't afford them full price so will keep my eye on them in case they go on sale."
1,Cozy and comfortable! Great elastic fit...might size down. i'm usually a size 2 in bottoms or a 26 in jeans and i bought the xs. it's perfect and goes great with boots!
1,"Soft,and feminine I love this sweater!! love the length, it's a bit loose and delicate compared to what i usually wear, but looks great with boots and leggings. love the sheer fabric across the bottom of the back, the loose bows on the sides and the drape of the fabric. all combine to make a great sweater. runs true to size, has a loose fit but you don't feel like you are drowning in fabric like some loose fitting cardigans."
1, Love! love! love! i got this jumper right before it started getting hot and it has been my go to all summer! fun night out with the girls.. perfect! walking around the mall... awesome! at work with a green vest... super! every time i wear this i get tons of compliments! did i mention it feels like you're wearing pajamas which in my book is everything! get it!
1,"Great piece! I purchased both colors offered and love this light weight full of neat detail piece to layer with other tops. the material is very soft and stretchy making it easy to wear over another item. i love the little shirt tail detail in back along with the drawstring trim in front. another piece that i am sure i will wear for years to come and the fit is true to size.
thanks antro!"
1,"Nice fit for cool weather I'm 5'9"" and this is a nice pencil-fit sweater skirt that is soft (not scratchy) and long enough. fun bias cut sweater pattern and pretty dark blue and black color."
1,"I wish I wanted this romper so bad, after buying (and loving) a shirt from madewell made with the same fabric earlier this year. i wish this romper was just a little bit longer and roomier. i normally wear a size 10 or 12 and bought the large. it fit me ok but i felt like i wanted it to be just a little bit more oversized around my hips and definitely wanted it to be longer in the legs. (retailer please stop with the capri lengths! it's tired!!) if you are narrow-hipped you will fare much better. the fab"
1,"Cute This dress is flattering, but size up. tight through chest in my normal size."
1, I love this sweater!!! it's so fun and quirky and shakes up a regular sweater. a little large but it fits the style.
1,"Cute dress The prints are very cute and flattering and the material is thick. i'm 5'2 107lb and 32c and got the xsp, my usual size. the shoulders and sleeves fit perfectly, the neckline is a little low (questionable for work). the fit however is off on the waist -- which is not as pictured. it is more of an empire waist ad barely even clears my boobs, so i doubt even a regular xs will change this much. it isnt a flattering look on my frame altho the prints hide it somewhat, except from the side view. also,"
1,"Pills very quickly I wore this immediately after receiving it as a gift. after wearing it for almost 2 hours the fabric started to pill between my legs where it rubs. sucks!! i actually really love this jumper and it's very soft and comfortable. just wish it would last longer :( i'm going to be wearing this all the time this summer but i'm pretty sure it will rub to the point where there will be holes in my pants... between my legs.. 

only complaint about sizing is that the top is too big. i'm 5'2"", 135lbs, 34a"
1,"Really like this cape Just love sweatshirts & ponchos, so what an unusual twist of style! ordered my usual size s during the promo. looks pretty much as in the pic. oversized arm openings are created by a string attached to the sides of the garment. it's ok but may eventually break off. maybe i'll secure w/ snaps or just sew it on by hand. wore it yesterday w/ just a tank underneath to lounge around. later wore for casual dining. it turned cooler & changed to a grey t-shirt underneath along w/ dark blue denim skinnys"
0,"Beautiful but.... I loved this skirt. so flattering and such a beautiful fabric. unfortunately after only 2 wears, the waistband stretched out so much that it was falling off me (literally). i bought the right size and it was not too tight. the waist band material simply lost its stretch very quickly. very disappointing."
1,"Cute This is a cute, casual romper but i'm on the fence about keeping it. i hate when there is a pattern mismatch - especially across the butt and that's why i'm on the fence. i bought my usual xs/0, (5'7"", 115lbs, 32b). i would say that it is a little roomy around the bust - if i keep it i might have to have it altered slightly to stop my bra from showing. this is the first jumpsuit that i have tried that actually accommodates my longer torso - so many seem to ride up and that is not flattering!

1,Cute and casual I purchased the bird design top for my 17 year old daughter. the fit was true to size and it's a very unique item for casual wear. it looks nicer in person than in the photo.
1,"Comfy but... The top is huge! i wear an xs and am not the bustiest of women, but the top part of this romper felt like it belonged on a medium or large, even though the bottoms and waist fit perfectly. i was really disappointed, as i loved it in every other way."
1,"Great pants! I'm a big fan of level 99 jeans and linen pants. these are great-- good quality, flattering fit, lovely color. i got the coral in size 26/petite, and that works for me. they do start out just a bit snug in the seat when i first put them on, but they'll pretty quickly stretch out just enough to maintain shape without becoming baggy, like my other level 99 linens-- something to keep in mind when trying to find your right fit. i was a little worried that the drawstring meant there wouldn't be much"
1,"Beautiful classic shirt! This shirt runs a little big, i bought it for my niece who usually wears a medium , but the small fit her. she is tall and this was a nice length on her.it's very comfortable and is a a perfect staple to send her off to college with. i paired it with the nouveau belt in silver- as an option for her to wear it with- great buy!
my niece is 5' 11"" with an athletic build."
1,"Great shirt, poor initial impression I do love this shirt, but when it arrived, it had makeup around the collar, apparently from someone else who had tried it on. i was able to clean it up with just soap and water so no big problem, but it did make for a poor first impression!"
1,"Gorgeous sweater I love this sweater! it is very lightweight- the knit is a wider weave, so if you are cold natured be sure to layer and bring a jacket. the fit is great, it is very flattering on. the back is lined and has the gray fabric that shows past the sweater hemline which adds to the uniqueness. this could be dressed up or down- i paired with a white tee and dark jeans and flats but will wear it next with nice pants and maybe a white collared blouse. very happy with my purchase!"
1,"Stretch out a lot Purchased these recently and loved the fit and feel upon trying them on. i was hoping that unlike linen pants, they'd keep their shape. no such luck. after an hour or two in them they were hanging and sagging. this is after being a (good) snug fit. i purchased my usual size and i'd say they stretched at least a size or two bigger. the color and feel of these is very nice and i see them being perfect for a very casual or slightly dressier outfit so i do recommend them. however, buy them small bec"
1,"Large? small? just right? a goldilocks review. I vacillate betwixt saying this shirt runs large and small. i usually wear a small in retailer items, but the xs was all that was left in the charming bee print. the fit is flattering even though it's smaller than my usual size. conclusion: runs large. however, when i went to put my head through the top of the shirt, it was like being birthed. conclusion: runs small. bottom line: i'm in love with this shirt and so i'll just have to get used to the faux birthing feeling every time i put it o"
0,"Carpet fabric The fabric is really itchy, i felt like i was wearing a carpet, and it reminded me of the 70's fabric crimplene. this will not be comfy in humid weather. the top also had a strange synthetic odor.it was returned."
1,"Cute length, fabric and aesthetic Love this skirt. very comfy. looks like it's very expensive material but feels comfortable."
0,Not proportioned I ordered a small and the top part was huge yet the bottom a little snug. you need a big chest and small legs and bottom. too bad. it's very cute.
0," I was really excited to receive this caftan, but it looked very strange on my body. i have small shoulders and the xs was still very big on me. there's also a seam along the sides that made me look boxy. the quality is really great, but i thought that the color seemed a tad bit darker/muted than pictured."
1,Classic romantic feminine dress Love this dress.  the color is beautiful.  runs large so size down
1,"Oh-my-gosh The pictures are not showing how absolutely spectacular this caftan is. it is very delicate (even says so on the tag) and lightweight so that you won't dread wearing it in the heat of the day. by what doesn't show up is that this caftan shimmers-there is gold string woven throughout the entire garment which gives it a slight sheen. it adds significantly to the impact of the garment, and i love this detail. i love the way this caftan drapes, and i love that it is longer than a normal caftan. the"
1, I bought this top for work but i can also wear it out with friends. it is made well and has a lining that is comfortable and makes it flow nicely. it will be nice for summer. you can tie the neck or just leave the ties down so it has options.
1,"Versatile and gorgeous I was a bit hesitant to purchase because of the other reviews but so glad i did! i usually wear a 4-6 and the 6 fit great. it feels like high quality and i think the shirt will work well for both work and casual events. i have a long torso and don't find it too short at all. it is a tad tight across the shoulders, so if you are broad in that area, it might not work for you. overall, love!"
1,"Skylark caftan dress Wonderful print and color. dress style is very boxy and oversized, fabric is great but has no drape."
1, This is the most beautiful bathing suit ive ever owned. it is so unique and comfortable. the fit and everything is just amazing. so happy with this purchase.
1,"Perfect I love this blouse. i debated because of the cost. but this is a top i will wear forever. i have not found any of the issues other reviewers have. fit fine in the arms and the length was perfect and i have a long torso. i wear it with a nude bra and i don't have any problems with its being see through. i wore it to a party the other day and received several compliments. i was also stopped in the store and asked where i got it. it looks expensive and special. i worn it with jean, black jeans and"
1,"Old retailer Ok, so yes, it is true that the top part where the sleeves are can be snug a little, especially if you work out, but overall i found the top to run true to my regular size (i only tried on the 0, didn't try bigger). the length was great for me being short, i didn't think i need the petite (i usually do for pants and skirts/dresses, tops on and off). the look of the shirt is also classic, flowy and it looked great with e half tuck. the embroidery is also nice though one part of it seemed loose. a"
1,"Fun summer top I tried on the pink version, really nice, the fit is loose, but flattering. opening at the neck looks nice either tied or not. fabric is airy. it looked nice tucked in or with a wide leg pant. i passed only because the color wasn't as bright as i need for my pale skin. overall, very nice. 

xs fit at 115 lbs, 30 dd, 26.5 in waist"
1, This really is a beautiful blouse. it's much prettier in person than in the photo. the embroidery is delicate and the blouse is feminine. is has a nice drape that isn't boxy or flowy. my only complaint is that it gaps widely right at the bust. and i am not busty at all. there is no pulling it together and smoothing it out. it is just too tight and it has to be returned. boooo
0,"Wanted to love it but way too short!!! I was so excited to receive this top!!! the material and design is gorgeous but it is way way way too short!!! i'm 5'7"" with an hourglass shape/average build and it barely hit the top of my pants! it otherwise fit true to size. so disappointed!!!! and for the price, it really should be cut better."
1,"Very cute!! I love this shirt, bought it at the store. i have a few shirts from this brand so i knew how it would fit. i love the colors in this short, it's very spring and light weight! love it very much!"
1,"Even better than pictured! This shirt is so beautiful and fits perfectly. it is so soft too, i didn't expect it to be so soft!"
1,"Love! Love this swimsuit. runs true to size. definitely recommend. very flattering. for reference i have a straight/athletic build, i'm 5'11"", 150, 34c, and size 8 was great for top and bottom."
0,"It is not white color, it looks beige indoors The tops looks fitted on the model because she pressed her arms against the clothes. to my surprise,
the tops actually is very very very r o o m y below the chest area.
the appliques/laces on the front are made of low quality materials."
1,"Comfy and pretty I love this top! it is modest enough for work, but fun enough for weekends. soft, comfortable, and lovely pink color. i want it in every color! (it seems to only come in two colors, though.)
soft flowy fabric, is lined with a soft inner fabric as well. super flattering for any body type!"
1,"Beautiful This is a true tiny top........gorgeous and runs small. i usually wear a small or medium in retailer tops, but timy i always size up. i'm a 36c, and a large fits perfect. the front is a bit sheer, but not so much you need a cami."
1, Love this top! very feminine and looks cute with heels and jeans or can be worn more casually too!
1,"Super cute! Bought this in the silvery grey color in the store yesterday, and i have to say the photos don't do this top justice. it hangs beautifully, is nicely lined, and is well made. i will leave the ties hanging rather than tied. it isn't too long, but long enough and has a nice swing. i'm short waisted and large breasted and this top is super flattering on me!"
1,Great jumper :) Love these! i call them my work overalls because thats pretty much what they are. the pictures of course don't show it but the sides are cut all the way to the waist band at the beginning of the pant. they were very flattering and quite comfy. these are just something easy to throw on and go to work in. i ordered these in a medium and they fit me perfectly. i do wish the top area was slightly wider to accommodate larger busts.
1,"Best for less chest I love this top so much i tried it on twice. because i forgot why it didn't work the first time: i have a chest. i'm just a c cup, but i looked lumpy and matronly in this top. if that's not an issue for you, i think you'll love it."
0,"Cute but didn't work I love this dress. it's an unusual material and really adorable in person. the problem was that it runs so large that i couldn't make it work. i'm usually an xs regular. the xs swallowed me. so then i ordered it in a pxs and pxxs because i really wanted it to work. only the pxxs fit, but it was so short that there was no way i could make it work. and i'm only 5'1"". i am 51 years old so i am not comfortable wearing ultra short dresses. maybe a person who doesn't mind really short would be able to"
1,"Beautiful but too small for me! Usually can just buy tiny shirts knowing that they will fit me!  and this one is beautiful but if you have any type of chest it will not work.  i'm a 34d and it
was way too small in the chest area.  it is a beautiful shirt though and i'm very sad that i have to return it.  it will work better on someone else for sure.  so i recommend this beautiful shirt for someone with a different body type from mine!"
0, Material is gorgeous and soft but the fit is another story. i am a size 12/14 but very small busted. this suit is definitely meant for someone with a larger chest. the padding was so overwhelming. i also have a long torso so it just didn't really line up were the peplum should be. too bad. it's very pretty. but looked horrible.
1,"Thoroughly femine Hi, i love this top. it not only is femine but it is wee bit sexy. it could be worn in the office then out for happy hour"
1,"Perfect For me, this is the perfect tshirt. love the shape, size, material etc. just really like it. flattering and good quality."
0,"Lovely but odd sizing I received this top and loved the pattern. however, i ordered both and s and m, and the bust sizing on this top is very odd. i am a 34c, and the bust area was way too big on both, but if i had sized down to the xs the rest of the suit would be too small. maybe it's just made for busty people? also the supportive material in the bust area goes straight across kind of like a bandeau, so that added to the odd look of the bust. it's still a beautiful pattern, so if you're going to give it a try orde"
1,"Love this adorable breezy look. This is one of my favorite tops! i have it in two colors. it's almost like a swing look, yet it still feels like it gives me a shape to my body. very easily paired with a skinny jean. i paid full price for th two, but now i'm sure i'll buy the third on sale!"
1,"Very pretty dress This dress is super super pretty. it is very dull light blue grey, very romantic with the black blow. very very pretty, i love it! my only complaint is that it ""balloons"" up a bit due to the fabric. it is very fitted for me, i think if it were a tad loose fitting it would not balloon up around the curves as much. it is short and comes a little above the knees. i love this dress for it's romantic look, it can be paired with leggings as well.can't wait to wear it."
1,"It's adorable Very cute. a size small worked perfectly for me, fits like a glove. it has open sides so i wear a tank top under it."
1,"Buy one size up! Love this shirt, bought this shirt, returning this shirt. believe this and the other reviewers who say it runs small, especially through the bust, and even if you're not busty. it's now sold out in my size, wish i'd gotten a bigger size that i could keep!"
0,"Beauty and the beast I love the designs of tiny blouses. but i wish they could make them more durable. i have owned several blouses in the past where i have to use a little pin to secure the button line from pulling at the breast area, or that after a few delicate washings have come apart at a seam. and ironing or steaming them is a must. this blouse was no exception. it went back because of pulling at the bust. i'm willing to take some extra care of my clothing out of my busy schedule, but i shouldn't have to! 5'7"""
0,"Gaps at the top button - but so pretty This blouse is very pretty, but it does gap at the top button. darn! such a hassle to have to return it, or exchange it. but i love it and otherwise it seems to fit."
1, The pullover is very light weight material so great for fall or spring. it hangs nicely in front and back and is slimming. i ordered a medium other than the sleeves are not as long on me as the model it fits perfectly.
1,"Lovely top Beautiful and comfortable, although it is a lot looser at the bottom than pictured, and the slit on the sides is quite high. not deal breakers though!"
1,Much nicer in person Such a pleasant surprise. i saw this in the store and had to try it on. it looks and feels like a lightweight real suede. the color is a wonderful neutral-much prettier than what i am seeing in the pic here. fits tts. although i will wear 0-2 petites in dresses and some pants i found the regular xs to be just right.
1,"So unique I was able to purchase this on sale and i'm so glad i did. i usually go between a size s and m (133 lbs., 5' 5"", 34 d) but the small fits perfectly. the color really isn't dark orange as stated......kind of a cross between rose/pale red/ salmon but i really love the color. it's not super heavy weight but not really thin either....actually perfect!"
1, These shorts were beautiful!! love the material and the way they fit. the drawstring makes them very adjustable.
1,"Favorite new sweater! I ordered a bunch of clothing from retailer last week, and this is by far my favorite purchase! the detail is gorgeous, it's very soft, and figure flattering."
1," Softest cardigan i've had in a long time! fits a little bit on the large side, especially in the sleeve length, but who doesn't love a big cozy sweater? this is a great way to add some color to any fall outfit. highly recommend this one. all i wish is that it came in more colors!!"
1,Beautiful shirt It turned out exactly as i'd hoped - very well made and very classy!
1,"Awesome jacket! This jacket is the best! definitely my staple jacket for the spring. it is so comfortable and soft. i usually wear a small in retailer clothing, but i opted for the medium in this so there's a little room for layering. even with the extra room, it is so flattering. i absolutely love this jacket!"
1,"Cute I love this tank, it is casual and comfortable, but has the little scarf attached to it, so sweet and styling. i tried on the xs regular, and would need petite, it was a bit long on me, but some people may prefer that. i also wonder about getting xxs only because it is a looser-fit tank. both colors are nice and neutral, good piece to add to a transition wardrobe. (115 lbs, 30 dd, 26.5 in waist)"
1,"Order in multiples Trying the gray version on in the store, i found that the size of the armholes varied greatly within the same size. i am a 32c, 5'6"", 120 lbs. bought the size s. the top looks great with a faded denim skirt and is also appropriate for office environment. i also ordered the ivory in a s, but again, the armholes were so large that i had to return it. if you decide to try this top, order it in multiples of two sizes to find one that fits your arms."
1,"Just okay...long length for petites I have other pairs of stevie jeans and looked forward to receiving these.i would say that they run about a size large compared to my other pairs. i am 5'2"" and ordered a petite, but i found the length to be about 2-3 inches too long. as compared to how they look on the model. also, the rise is relatively low. otherwise, the quality is great, and the denim is very soft. i will probably return these given that i am not wowed."
0,"Poor quality control I love the idea of this shirt, but the execution is absolutely horrible. i ordered online and what i received is just a mess. the stitching at the bottom has big globs of black thread. not just a few hanging off, but literally big clumps. a large portion of the stitching on the whole shirt looks like it should be on the underside of the shirt as the where the thread is tied off is on the outside!! the fit is just as big a mess. i always have to buy a large in fitted shirts because i have very br"
1,"Lovely sweater Love the short in the front, long in the back look. it has an almost glittery look. really roomy, i would size down. really comfy and pretty!"
1,Super cute! Fits nicely and made with high-quality material. it definitely makes you look very put together with some nice slacks for work. the scarf is a very nice detail and actually doesn&#39;t look like it is a part of the shirt. love!
1,"Chauvet cardigan I bought this during the 20% off and i'm glad i did. the sweater does run large, so i would recommend sizing down. i'm 5'4, 135 lbs, with a larger bust (34d) and even the size small is large on me (not large enough to exchange, but i would probably do better with an xs; even with an xs i would still get that oversized look). the color is not exactly as pictured, it is a brighter yellow in person. i was expecting more of a muted, soft, baby yellow, and that's not exactly what this is. some pros a"
0,"Nothing like other stevies I have other stevies, and these are nothing like them. the quality is very synthetic to a point that the material is shiny. the pants themselves run very small in the waist, approx. two sizes too small compared with other stevies. additionally, the cuff is sewn like that in place, and hits at an odd spot if you are taller or have strong calves. see how it gapes in the cuff on the model? like, a rounded bottom? that is way more emphasized in real life. buyer beware!"
1,"Super cute jacket ! runs a bit small This jacket is as cute as it looks in the picture, color is very close too. i normally wear a 4-6 top (sometimes s sometimes m). the small looked great until i tried to raise my arms - the cut runs a bit small acrossed the back). i love this jacket though! the m fits nicely and i highly recommend it!"
0,"No shoulder mobility 1st, this jacket fits true to size. 2nd, the shoulders are too tight (design--not sizing), as other reviewers have noted. it's such a beautiful design and material, so it's unfortunate that the shoulders are so tight the jacket is a little impractical.

i purchased this jacket with 40% off sale price. i'm not sure it's worth it for such oversight on shoulder mobility."
1,"Better in real life Bought this in store at full price: it's that pretty. black & white, embroidery, pintucks! throw it on with capris and flats and you are polished and comfy. my only prob was i had to buy a little large - size 8- as size 6 was already sold out. 
i am 5' 5"" , 130 lbs."
1,"Love this jacket! Really love this jacket! i agree with the previous review that while the x small fits great when i am standing--it is a little hard to raise my arms in it. however- it is great to wear over a dress or with jeans at the office. great quality- lined with jersey. i've gotten many compliments! (5'8, 120 lbs, xsmall)"
0,"Le sac I have been struggling to find a nice flowy summer dress that isn't too short. i am petite but do not like to wear my dresses too far above the knee, so i ordered this in the 00 regular. this dress was not what i expected. it is not flowy, but rather a heavy and stiff fabric. it is also way too wide. it looks like it can't decide whether to be a box or a bag. it is also shorter than advertised. last thing to disappoint was the color - darker and more muted than the photo on the website. i can't"
1,"Love this shirt This is a gorgeous shirt. it actually looks more fitted on than in this picture, where it looks more shapeless. even though i love tunics, the online picture wasn't appealing to me -- but when i saw the shirt in store and tried it on i loved it. wore it to work today and loved it even more. it's great quality, gorgeous design, lovely tailoring and details throughout."
1,"Best ag jeans yet I have many pairs of ag jeans -- mostly stevie's & harper's -- and while they're comfortable, i am always glad to take them off at the end of the day. these jeans are different. the fabric is very, very soft & feels like it's been washed & worn dozens of times. but the color & finish of the jean looks polished & spiffy enough to wear for evenings out or casual friday. and the fit is perfect, once i went up a size. slim and figure hugging but not at all constricting. my regular stevie's always fe"
1,"Ag delivers as usual but run small I have several pairs of ag jeans and am always pleased with them. i had to get these when i saw them in the store. i'm a sucker for cuffed jeans in the spring. i also love the dark wash. i was surprised when i tried on my usual size 27 that they were too tight. i ended up going with a size 28. for reference i am 5'4, 122 lbs."
1,"Perfect casual dress! This dress is perfect for weekend errands or i could see dressing it up as well. the material is a heavier weight, will not wrinkle and the pockets are an added bonus. i purchased the small in this dress and it is perfect. for reference: 32d, 27, 35"
1,"Love these jeans! These jeans are one of my all time favorite ag jeans. comfortable denim, dark rinse. wide cuffs are fashionable but still classy. wear them all the time!"
1,"Love this jacket! I had been looking for a jacket like this for months, but haven't found the right style, until i saw this one! luckily it was on sale. i am 5'10, weigh ca. 143lb's and i usually wear a size small in all retailer tops. tried on medium, but it was too big in the bust area., then i tried on the small and it fits great! the sleeves are long enough too, but it is hard to move my arms up to reach something, so i just have to avoid that. :) i have gotten a lot of compliments for it."
1,"Beautiful sweater This sweater is more stunning in person then on the site. i saw it on the internet previous to seeing in the store. i purchased it right away, it was love at first sight!!. the detail on the collar is beautiful, and reminds me of the unique sweaters i have have in my closet from retailer from years ago that i still love. get it before it's gone!!!!"
1,"Casual and comfortable This dress fits well and the material allows for hiding lumps and bumps. material is heavy, yet soft. i could see wearing it with sneakers as the model is, or dressing it up with jewelry and heels. this will be a perfect dress to take on vacation, as it won't get wrinkled and it is so versatile. i'm normally a size 4-8 depending on clothing item, and i bought this in a size small. fits perfect. for reference, i am 38-26-38."
1,"So cute! I bought this in store yesterday in a 2 petite - it definitely looks best if you can get it in your usual size (4 petite just looked too big and changes the look). love the embroidery detail. it was on display with the sleeves rolled up to elbows, and it's really cute that way too."
1,"Beautiful but a lot of sweater I loved this when i saw it online. tried it on in the store, and though it is beautiful, it's a lot of sweater. its a a bit heavy in weight, the buttons on the collar give you the option to wear it up or open as shown in the picture. the problem was that when it was open the big button loop hung down right in front. that was probably the determining factor against purchasing it. if it goes on sale i may reconsider."
0,"Narrow shoulders I totally agree with the last reviewer. i'm 5'2"" 115 pounds with somewhat wide shoulders. the x-small fit my torso but was so tight in my shoulders i couldn't move my arms. the small was better but was too big in the torso. the material itself was really nice. too bad the fit was so awkward and unflattering."
1,"New favorite jeans I love these jeans. they are very comfortable and do not stretch excessively after wear. i found the cut to be very flattering and the material to be heavy enough to hold its shape while still having enough give to move around and chase after little ones. they look great paired with a v-neck and flats or cute blouses and heels. a great buy! like another reviewer i, too, found these ran a little small and went up a size."
1,"Gorgeous!!!! I love this sweater jacket! found it on the sale rack in a medium and fits like a medium would fit from my adored retailer! i am 5,4' inches and 34dd chest and curvy 145 lbs. the knitted detailed collar is a show stopper and what makes this item look like an an old school retailer item. the color is really not orange but more of a vintage rose with hints of rust and soft shades of pink. i love this color and i think it would look beautiful on many skin tones. i paired it with a pink blouse from anth"
1,"High low top I also sized down, and i'm glad that i did. i had been watching this top for awhile and was glad to get it on sale. it is not thick- more of a top than a sweater."
1,"Comfy and cute! This is way shinier in person than i expected, but i like it. there are gold threads throughout which stand out. i love shiny things so i was pleasantly surprised. i agree that you could size down if you wanted, but it looks cute roomy and loose i think. really soft. i will wear this to the park or dressed up for dinner. love the double duty aspect. i'm a little bummed about the fabric content, but that's it."
1,"Unique collar The knit collar and the color and the drape is what makes this lilitz cardigan so wonderful and an excellent addition to my signature retailer sweater collection. as previous reviewers stated, the color is not orange but more of a marled rose yarn. the body of the sweater is lightweight, draped, stretchy and warm and the knit collar is much heavier. because of my body type (36ddd, heavy upper back, rounded shoulders) this cardigan doesn't look great on me when left open as the collar doesn't fall"
1,Love it! I finally found these jeans!! love them and have been wearing them almost everyday!
1,"Versatile and unique I ordered this shirt with some trepidation after reading the one-star reviews. i was, however, pleasantly surprised when the shirt arrived and i put it on. i agree the sleeves are a bit on the slim side, noticeable mostly because the fabric doesn't have any give. the shirt fabric itself is both billowy and substantial and the embroidery work gives the shirt an expensive (because it is) and unique look. the shirt body is not as slim cut as it appears in the pictures; the darts open out to a much"
1,"Gorgeous, sleek and warm Gorgeous, soft (yak hair, whaa?), versatile sweater. lean fit, not bulky. runs maybe a little large. i'm generally between a s/m in tops, so i ordered both. the s fit really well. the m did too, but a bit bulkier and wide in the hips. i'm 5'8"", 140 lbs, 34c. i'll wear this with everything, mostly with leggings or tight jeans with boots."
1,"Beautiful top! I bought this top for my 15 year old daughter, and she thinks it is beautiful. it's very comfortable, and good for days that are not too cold, but not too warm. lovely!"
1,Beautiful in neutral color I really liked this cardigan. it is well made and very pretty. i will wear it when it gets a little cooler in early fall because i tried to wear it on one of these really hot days and it felt little too warm.
1,"Versatile piece I haven't worn this yet, but i can't wait too! i'm 5'3 145 pounds, ordered a size small. it's fits perfect! in fact, it's long enough that i may be able to pull it off as a mini dress on a hot day. that said, i will mostly layer this piece. the ruching on the side flatters the body. i would buy this in more colors if it was available! also, the material is a nice soft quality."
1,"Lovely! This cardigan is a beautiful - not too thin, but soft and versatile. the cutouts add a nice unique detail. i was worried that the cuts might fray, but they actually have a very thin bit of glue to prevent fraying. really beautiful piece for those of us with cold summer offices :)"
1,"Love. Love the fit and feel of the fabric. says to dry but i found the leg seams did bunch up a bit so next time i won't dry them, i'll hang to dry. very cute style. super comfy."
1,Great look Love these pants. also ordered them in blue. great fit and style.
1,"Much better in person Just bought this dress in a 6. i'm 5'7"" 138 lbs (32b, 29 in jeans). this is *so* much better than pictured. it's an empire waist that really flatters my small bust and accentuates the thin part of the waist. i have an hourglass figure, but can see this working great for pear shapes. i wish the material felt softer, but the fit was so perfect, even for my broad shoulders. will transition nicely to warmer weather, but for now, i plan to wear it with leggings and a cardigan."
1,"Cute and comfortable dress! This is the perfect casual yet stylish dress. and, it's extremely comfortable!"
1,"Beautiful in person The model pose does not do this dress justice. it is super flattering, and the fabric is a thick light fabric, can't explain it.. the pattern is simply adorable, i can't figure out why this one is on sale while other colors aren't as in my opinion, this is the nicest one.

fits true to size as in my lower range. i tried on both pettie and regular and went with regular. petite was too short for me. i went with size 0 and am 5'1.5 and weight about 115."
1,"Like but not love I ordered these for store pick up and loved the color (red ones). the fit in petite ws nice and flattering, but iwould have to wear them with ehels still. th reason i didn't keep them is perhpas the pocket placement in front didn't flatter me as well? i think maybe i will order when on sale, or find a similar style with different frnt pockets."
0,"Cool fabric But i didn't like the fit. maybe because i ordered petite and the length threw me off, but they weren't flattering in any way. the color and material were unique and pleasing. had to send them back though."
0,"Love this artist's work, not the material for this I have a collection of this artist's paintings throughout my home. she is a favorite. i was so excited to see the first clothing item offered at retailer. i ordered it at full-price. it looks the same in person as in the photos. the fit was true to size--it fits me as shown on the models. the knit was comfortable. the problem was the printed fabric. it was so flimsy and kept attracting static. no matter what i tried, i couldn't get the static problem solved. it was unwearable because of how messy"
1,Cute buttondown; runs large Looks great with skinny jeans or even white pants. i have wider hips (usually an 8 or 10 on bottom) and narrower shoulders (small or medium on top). i bought the medium and probably should have sized down to the small as this was a little large on me but the top still looked good being oversized. i am a 34b and did not have any issues with button gap. my only negative is that the material wrinkles easily. the floral detail on both the pocket and the sleeves is a nice touch.
0," I love the colors in this top, but sadly i'm going to have to return it. the first thing my husband did when he saw this on me was just stare, and not in a good way. then he said it looked like a maternity top. i was so disappointed, and sadly will be returning this. for reference, i am 135 pounds. 5-ft. 4-in tall and do not want to look pregnant in a top. i normally wear size medium tops, but this one is huge. now i know why the model in the picture had her arms nestled in at her sides. this to"
1,"Clever cutout design Just picked up this cardigan in the heather charcoal - so i can wear it in the fall and winter. the design on the border is well done and will show off whatever you wear under this cardi. sleeves are snug and long, but can easily be pushed up to 3/4 length."
1,"Cutest dress! As another review said, the model's pose doesn't do this dress justice and i can't believe this is on sale. i picked this up this weekend at my local store. it fits wonderfully, very flattering. the fabric feels good and i'm fairly certain won't wrinkle too easily which is going to make this the perfect dress for packing for a trip. dress it up with boots for dinner, dress it down with sandals for day. this is a steal, get it! (i'm 5'8"", ~145, the size 8 fit perfect)"
0,Incorrect sizing Way too long...the sizing is incredibly off on this product. order a size or two down.
1,"Love this cardigan! This cardigan is very similar to the c keer wrapped asters cardigan from a few years ago....i have this cardigan and have loved wearing it; i think it only came in cream color. unfortunately, i caught the cutouts a few times, and the cutouts are slightly ripped in 2 spots...not very noticeable, but i know they're there! so i was delighted to see that retailer brought back this cardigan, this time from meadow rue. i purchased both the cream and gray colors in a size small....i am usually a s"
1,Polka dots This dress is so much better in person. i would say it is tts but it was oddly baggy around the chest/armpit area which didn't deter me from keeping it. the biggest negative i have is that it is rayon but i don't think that'll change with retailers anytime soon.
1," Loved the styling, versatility, fit & quality of this top! length was good, not too fitted, perfect piece under cardigans & jackets. will look great with jeans, leggings or skirt. very happy with this purchase."
1, I bought an retailer cami 10 years ago and it is still in good shape so i looked on the website to see if they still carried them and they did! i bought 3 i was so excited!
1,Cute sweater Great addition to wardrobe ...have already worn a lot. soft and lightweight.
1,Work of art The colors of this top are even better in person. the blue is easy to pair with denim and there is no need to accessorize -- the print does all the talking! it is a bit wide on the bottom and the print material is pretty thin. it definitely looks like something not everyone else has - worth the splurge.
1,"Beautifully different! This is a beautiful cardi. the cutouts and the full front panels all make it stand out. that said, there are 2 minor flows imo worthy of mentioning, none diminish my satisfaction toward it though. the sleeves are slim, meaning no long-sleeve shirts under it, for me at least. the fabric is a bit ""catchy"", meaning you'd better wear something silky or slippery under so the fabric doesn't crumple up behind your back. nevertheless, i will have so many uses for it 

last, but not the least, is my sa"
1,"Super comfy Love these pants- they are so soft and comfortable- do not fall down like low rise trousers.  i like the length for wearing with flats - most wide bottom pants are too long, and these are very casual to be worn with flats."
1,"Adorable top! I love this top! the colors are beautiful & look incredible with jeans as well as so many of the different color pilcro pants in my closet. it's the perfect between-season item.
since i don't like garments that have a ""boxy"" fit, i was concerned that this top wouldn't work for me after reading some of the other reviews. but it looks great & feels comfy."
1,"Springlike and pretty but runs large Looks nearly exactly like the picture. will be very comfortable to wear. i ordered a petite large and could really have worn a medium. it's big all over. i figure i'll do a little tailoring on this come spring and adjust the fit. on the whole, happy."
1,"Very nice material, soft! I got this in the brown and absolutely love it. this is perfect for cool weather. i'm super particular about fabric quality and this cardigan does not disappoint"
0,"Cute pants but they lose shape quickly Love the cut and the way they drape. size 26 and 5'6"" 135lbs fit great until you wear them for an hour. all of a sudden my 26s became 28s. they were practically falling off. i plan to wash them to see if they shrink. i wish they held their shape since they are so cute."
0,"Disappointed The top looks better on the model than in-person. it fits loose and looks boxy and matronly. i don't like the sleeve length or the top style, it just didn't look flattering or good. i am sending it back. looks very boxy."
1,Beautiful design This is a beautiful top! extremely classy. looks great with dressy trousers or jeans. drapes very nicely. the petite medium fits me perfectly (5'1 126 lb). love it! the embroidery ads so much. so pleased with this purchase!
1,"Unique cardigan! I hesitantly ordered this cardigan after it spent weeks in my basket. i love it! i am usually ""large"" by retailer brand standards at 5'4"" 145 lbs, but the small fit quite big and i'm glad i didn't go for the larger one. it is super unique and cozy. i gave it a 3 on quality because the knit is a bit itchy and the fibers do come off on other layers. it also is longer than i expected, it hits about my mid thigh."
0,"Gorgeous dress but ill fitting I bought a size small in this dress even though i am usually a large at retailer. it just hung strangely and clung to the unflattering parts of my body but seemed very large. i loved the feel, color (grey) and style of the dress, but i ended up returning it because of the fit. it also requires something under it since it is fairly see-through."
1,Gorgeous swim suit Love the design and print. absolutely beautiful bathing suit. would size up on the bottoms. top is true to size.
1,"Lovely sweater/tunic I tried this on in the store, and i found my regular medium to be a bit too boxy. i ended up going with the petite large because i found it just fit better. it wasn't too wide and fit just right.
it is very soft, not itchy at all. it says dry clean only but it did great on my hand wash setting with cold water. laid it out to dry. great purchase."
0,"This was used!!! Got this in the blue and was so excited. while it looks cute, someone had clearly bought this, worn it, and returned it. it had human and dog hair all over it. not to mention some kind of red strings. it was pilling all over. so much for quality control!!! i don't mind buying used things but at least clean it up and give me a discount!"
1," Lovely style. i got the navy color and it's beautiful. i'm glad i ordered a smaller size after reading other reviews. my usual size would have been too big and not as figure flattering. but but but the sweater came pilled all over. i don't know if it had been worn and returned or if it's just the quality of the material but seriously there was pilling on the entire sweater. because the style is so nice and it fits well, i'm going to keep it and de-pill it but was disappointed with retailer :("
0,"Underwhelmed I was really excited to receive this dress but was disappointed that it really wasn't that special. i'm 134 lbs, 5'5"" and i ordered a regular size s and it did fit. i prefer my dresses right above my knees but this was probably 2 inches above the knees. it just wasn't that flattering nor worth the price. i expected to be wowed but wasn't!"
0,"Just not for me Colors washed me out, i need more vibrant colors. so cute on the model"
1," This top is beautiful, really special. i am a 32dd and this type of flowy top sometimes doesn't work for me but this one is fine. looks great with skinny jeans and boots or flats."
1,"So cute, but size up!! This top is so cute and of spectacular quality, but you have to size up! i'm a 10/m/34c all the time. i almost never have to size up or down. but this top was so tight around the bust that i couldn't possibly have closed the zipper in the back. i'm sending it back for a l in the hopes of a better fit. the coloring of the owls is out-of-this-world cute, so i'm keeping my fingers crossed that a larger size will be just right."
0, Really wanted to love...but...the way it fit..lower part a tad too flowy...almost maternity like to hide a belly and the top area feels like my chest is being smushed! despite my bra size being a modest 36b...the look it gave was square on top almost block like with bottom that had flare...such a pretty top unfortunately the overall design just didn't work me.
1,"Was very excited....but not for large busted This sweater is gorgeous...it is of great quality and very warm. i was very excited and wanted it to look great. however....i have a large bust and am full figured...so it was not appealing and just kind of ""hung there"". i feel that it would look great on thinner women...and it is a gorgeous sweater...just not for me!"
1," Gorgeous blouse, but a touch too large. i may return and try a small."
1,"This sweater dress is a keeper Overall, i love this dress. it's warm with tights or leggings in cold temperatures. and it's super effortless. there are a few things you should know prior to purchasing online though. the dress runs large. i ordered a large and its big. i'm ok with it; a super tight sweater dress is not was i was hoping for, but i might have been able to order a medium (i still kept the large). the weave of the fabric does not seem as tight as pictured. i felt the need to wear a tank top beneath because you cou"
1,"Feminine and romantic This blouse is very flattering. it drapes well and i love the textures. only problem is the head hole is a little small so if you buy the white one, put your makeup on after you have it on and remove your makeup before sliding it off. i bought an extra small even though i'm usually a small. lovely top. a lot of people have commented on it."
1,"Not worth full price! I loved this shirt online and ordered it in blue immediately even though i usually hesitate to spend over $100 on casual blouses. unfortunately, i was super disappointed when it arrived. the lace does not contrast as much as shown in these pictures and it just doesn't look all that special. having said that, it is super comfy and soft and the sizing is generous - it may run big on you if you have a small chest. all in all, i would buy it on sale but certainly not worth the price tag!"
1,"Love it so much that i bought both colors! I love this top! i ordered it in a medium, and it's perfect. i'm 47 years old, 5'2"", 125 lbs, for reference. the detail on this top is beautiful. can be paired with so many things. love it!!!"
1,Extremely flattering This is so adorable and flattering. dress it up or down with a denim jacket weekday to weekend.w/flats or pumps. love this cute dress. not all wool so it's not itchy at all. the colors are vibrant and would compliment any complexion!
1, I am so glad i ended up with these pants. wasn't ready to pay full price but ordered them immediately on sale & realized they were definitely worth every penny of full price. they are so soft & have so much detail. these pants are just gorgeous. i'm 32 and can't wait to wear these to cabo!! they may run a little large.
1,"Beautiful but growing dress!! Love this dress and its versatility! great design concept. fabric is pretty soft, cozy, and warm, as well. i found the dress to run large. i ordered a medium in the gray and small in the rose. i did like both colors irl, but the size small was the best fit. for reference, i'm 5'6"", 135 lbs, and wear a 6. the size small hit just above my knees and the sleeves reached down to my knuckles. i wore this around the house for awhile and realized that while the knit was nice and tight when i first put i"
1,"Soft lace This top is very pretty, i ordered both xs p and xxs p not knowing (someone wrote the word boxy in the review) - i tried on the xxs p first, and that was fine. did the trick to not look too boxy. teh fabric is stretchy, and soft/comfortable, not scratchy lace. the lining is soft as well. color is ivory and the embroidery is nice and fiery colors. the sleeves are fairly flattering, even on bigger arms. arm hole was just right too, never know with fluttery sleeves. 
for reference i am 115 lbs, 30"
1,"Lovely but color not true to pic I ordered this in a small and i am 32b and the fit is perfect. lovely details and very well made but the online pics make it look like a soft periwinkle blue, however when i pulled it out of the shipping bag, it was more gray-blue. dare i say...country blue. even the pictures i took in this top make the color look different than it really is. i almost sent it back and i love the color blue but it was soooo not what i was expecting. it grew on me so i'm keeping it in spite of it."
1,"Stunning top! I read the other reviews and from the picture it looked as though it may be a little short, so i ordered up to a large. the medium would have fit, but since i'm in my mid-40's i felt more comfortable with large. but if you are trim and young or young at heart your usual medium will be fine. live the material and the navy makes it classy and rich looking. can be dressed up or down. have worn it to a cocktail party fundraiser with blue crop pants and received many compliments. i'm always challenge"
1,"Delicate and elegant This blouse is stunning. it's ultra feminine but has a bit of bohemian feel to it. i am 5'3"" and 108 pounds. i ordered an xs at first in both colors but they were a little big in the bust area and under the arms. my bust size is 32c. i ordered the xxs in both sizes (not petite, as i have a longer torso) and they fit perfectly! they are not too snug anywhere and it makes the blouse look even better - obviously - because it fits better. the hem of the shirt in a size xxs hits right below the hip b"
1,"Transitional sweater dress I saw this in the store and immediately had to try it on. it fits perfectly. i'm usually a size 4/6 with dresses and the small fit perfectly. it looks expensive and high quality and the print is unique. what i love most about it is that i can wear it in the winter time, layered over say.... a black turtle neck and black tights... but i think it can also be worn in the spring, especially with that flower print."
1," I love, love these wide leg pants! the embroidery detail give them a little something extra special. they are comfortable, and perfect. the length is great for wedges, and the fold over waist does not add bulk. the only downside, and this is probably due to my figure, but the pockets do need to be sewn shut so that they will lie flat."
0,"A bit disappointing I have been looking for a quality pair of black skinny jeans for a while. after reading the reviews, i had such high hopes for these jeans. i bought it in my usual size 28 and while the top part fit perfectly, i found that the bottom was too tapered in and ultra skinny making it not look right. sadly, i had to return."
1," I was on the fence about this dress - i wanted something nice but casual for a family graduation. i'm glad i took the chance once it went on sale! the fabric is not as thick as you'd expect for a ""sweater."" just thick enough to hide any imperfections, panty lines, etc. i plan to layer with long sleeved tees or a jean jacket. i think it will do great through fall with tights and a turtleneck.

i'm 5'6', 135 lbs, 34b and the small fit perfectly. i am ""pear - shaped"" by conventional standards, bu"
1,"The perfect white top Adorable peasant fitting top.  not too voluminous, just right for over jeans, and really cute with shorts.  the detail makes it wearable for dress up or down, and the cut is classic!"
1,Feminine and pretty style I love this blouse. i wasn't sure if i was going to like the high neck but it fits the style. the quality is excellent. i bought a size small and i wear a size 2-4 or xs-s in retailer most of the time. i could have worn the xs if i was a little smaller busted (34c). i'm 5'9 and i didn't like where the gathering hit with the xs. very flowy without looking like a maternity top. it's also lightly lined so i don't have to wear a cami. warning - this shirt is long. if you are on the short side you may
1,"Versatile I passed over this dress online thinking i'd never wear it. but, then i found myself inside an retailer store and decided to try it on. i am excited to say that i love this dress. it is soft and lovely. the cowl is large and the whole dress has a really great drape. my favorite thing is that the buttons along the back are functional. opening up the back turns this dress into a long cardigan that is to die for."
1,Pretty top This top would have been better if it had a stretchy  fabric. being large breasted makes this top a little tight. still so pretty so i'm keeping it. makes me look a little less chesty.
0,"Weird boxy fit The lace on this top is pretty, and i liked the way it was styled in the product photos, but did nothing for me on. between the loose sleeves and the boxy cut of the front, it just sort of hung shapelessly on me. i also found the back to be much shorter than 30.5""--it came to a few inches below my hips and was not tunic length like i expected. the shoulders fit me well, and because the top was boxy already, i didn't want to size up for length. for reference i tried on xs (i'm 5'4"", 120 lbs)."
1,"Cute and comfy Very cute and comfy dress. i'm 5'6"" and 117 pounds and the xs worked great. it is meant to fit big and comfy so don't expect a tailored dress. looks great with tights and boots and i love that you can turn it around to make it a cardigan!"
1,"Perfect for work I absolutely love this top. i managed to snag one that had been returned to a store, so i didn't have to order it. i love the cute and the overall boho feel to it. i feel like it's true to size, as i'm normally a medium in retailer."
1,"Interesting color, thin material I am undecided if i will keep this dress or not. i am 5/4, 155 lbs and ordered both the small and medium. the medium was comically large on me, with broad shoulders and a sack-like appearance. but the small fit very well and felt very french girl chic. the brownish-greenish color is really stunning in person, like a greenish copper. and the gathered sleeves elevate this into a dressier look. but the material is sheer, so you would need to wear a slip, and the elastic waist still has somewhat of"
1,"Beautiful top I was in love with this top from the moment i put it on. it is of high quality, with layers to ensure the top isn't sheer. the embroidery is so pretty and the top looks way less grandma in person. i ordered the petite xxs and it fits perfectly. i really appreciate that the underarm holes are just the right size and don't show off any of my bra, which sometimes happens with sleeveless tops. i can wear it with jeans and boots or with a pencil skirt and heels and it looks great with both outfits. o"
1,"Darker colors then pictures The picture makes it looks like it has rich brown yellow and orange colors. when it came, it was more black with some orange that popped. much different then i expected. the material was nice and silky but i was not willing to keep something that was dry clean only. i sent it back."
1,"Great basic - bought all 3 colors Great top! i'm 5'7"", 135lbs and normally wear either an xs or s. i ordered the white to start with and decided to go back for the other 2 colors. it's a great basic to wear with pants/shorts/skirts, but the side slit and slant set it apart from a regular tank. i opted for the small in this top just because of where the side slit hit."
1,Great dress. This is an adorable dress. medium weight. i highly recommend.
0,"Not for those who are even slightly pear-shaped There isn't much shape to this dress. it's fairly straight from top to bottom. i'm smaller on top with a small waist but slightly pear shaped. the top half was somewhat loose but the bottom half just clung too much. i'm 5'2"" and 107 lbs and bought a pxs for reference. also, i wore a tee shirt underneath and the dress shed all over it."
1,"Love, love, love! Great arm coverage, soft material, flattering fit. wear with favorite worn-in jeans with holes in the knees and also with white jeans and long or short shorts. i really should purchase another color for summer work staple."
1,"Embroidery provides ""wow"" factor! Such a lovely, well constructed top. looks great on petite frames. free flowing but not too ""peasant-like."" the embroidery is gorgeous. while it is pricey, it is something you will wear for years as it is a timeless piece."
1,Petal perfect! Lovely statement shift. sweet and sophisticated at the same time. the lightweight knit drapes nicely over one's figure. my store showed it paired with a collared cream-white blouse for alternative styling. i know i'll be experimenting with solid tees.
1,"Simply beautiful This is a pretty dress. like the positive reviews have noted.
very figure flattering"
1, I haven't worn it yet. i tried it on when i got it and like it alot
0,"Shorter than advertised I love sweater dresses and was excited to find a dress that would be long enough for me to feel comfortable in. i am petite, but at my age i am not comfortable in things that fall more than an inch or two above my knee. this dress is much shorter than stated, and much shorter than it looks on the model. i measured the petite xxs (my normal size) and it is 31"" from the shoulder seam to the hem, not 36"" as stated. five inches is a big discrepancy. the color and style were lovely, but i just can't"
1," I love this sweater dress! i was hesitant to order it after reading some of the reviews, but fear not, friends--this is a comfortable, flattering, warm dress with a unique twist. i love the cowl and the buttons down the back. the knit is fairly large so there's some give to it, which means pulling it on is a breeze, and the buttons don't slip out of their closures unexpectedly, which is an added bonus. i ordered both grey and navy. i stand at 5'6"" and would describe myself as pear-shaped, typica"
0,A big disappointment This dress is super bulky and unflattering. the knit is loose and see-through. looks like it was knitted by a five-year old. if you need a dress that adds twenty pounds then this is for you. back to the store it goes
1,"Beautiful but delicate This blouse runs large, billows out slightly, and hangs in a boxy straight way. i'm normally a medium but can probably wear a small in this blouse. the blouse is lined with a light-weight material but i can still see through it just a little bit. although very pretty, the blouse can snag easily so be careful when wearing. regardless, i plan to return for a small because this blouse is beautiful and unique. perfect for fall with its warm colors or summer because it's light weight."
0,"Beautiful, but awkward fit and not worth the price I love the lacey design of this top. however, it is very wide and doesn't fit well on someone with a small frame. i tried ordering a petit size. the width was better, but this size was too short. in addition, the lace didn't lay very flat, and there were lose threads all over. overall, not worth the price."
1,"Love this top! I bought this in red in xs (5'5 115lbs). it's really cute and flirty, but not in a little girl way, which some ruffle tops can look. the material is nice. a little over priced, but isn't everything from retailer?! the red is a perfect red imo, it's got an orange-y undertone to it, looks so good with white jeans and black sandals. if you're inbetween sizes, i would size down but otherwise pretty true to size. i wear everything in xs from retailer and the xs fits perfect."
1,"Found the ""one"", won't need to buy anything else The rocket by citizens of humanity are my favorite jeans. perfect high rise and still makes the butt look good. they are incredibly comfortable. no more hiking up your jeans and bending over. love these so much. am very happy that j brand and citizens are making some good high rises now. won't buy anything else."
1,Cozy dress that's still chic This dress is so cozy and soft. love it! the cowl is big in a flattering way. absolutely adore the buttons that run down the back of the dress. such an unexpected detail which makes retailer pieces so special. i would layer tights and tank underneath anyway so the see through aspect other reviewers mentioned wasn't apparent to me and also wasn't as big a deal.
1,"Better than expected! I was very impressed with the fit of this sweater dress. i am a 4p, 5'4"" and the length and general fit of this is perfect. the fabric is so soft. love it!!"
1,"Best top ever I own quite a few pieces from retailerplogie but this one is my favorite by far! the color is a crispy white. the length is just right and has a beautiful flow to it. it is more fitted on top but flares out for a feminine appeal. i am 5' 1"", 115 lbs. i bought the regular xs and it fit like a nice tunic top. perfect for a curvy figure- i wore it with my tight jeans and boots. got compliments from everyone!"
1,"Not sure I'm 5'3"", 155 lbs; ordered the blue in a large. beautiful color and fabric. it's big and a bit wide and long, hitting below my knee. i might reorder in a smaller size because it has great potential. cute casual or dressy. i agree that it needs a slip but not so obviously sheer in the blue color."
1,"Underwhelmed I stalked this blouse and when the price dropped, i pounced on the black. sadly, it did nothing for me. i'm a large, sometimes medium, but decided on the large. you'd think it came with its own cami at this price, but no. completely sheer. unwearable without one. the lace is nothing special. the collar is wider in the back, uncomfortable and pulls on the lace in the front. the high/low hem fit me oddly in the back. i'm returning this one."
0,Cute dress online but not for me I purchased this dress online and it just didn't fit my body very well. it also arrived with a pretty sizeable hole so i can't say that i'm impressed with the quality. there were other areas too where was a loose thread which i'm sure will develop into another hole eventually. returned.
0," I love love love the soft fabric and the cozy cowl. however mine not only had a giant hole, it seemed like the yarn started pilling as soon as i touched it. love the idea, but not practical, even without a hole =)"
1,Love This sweater dress is so soft and great quality...you can dress it up or down... i will get a lot of use out of it!
1,"Instant love! Saw this online, but it said the store was out of stock. imagine my surprise when i went to my local store and found it in both a small and a medium in white.. i tried them both on, but not a lot of difference in the sizing. the small had a smaller head/neck opening causing it to be a bit tough to remove without getting makeup on it, which the small did. the medium fit very very close to the small, but a smidge bigger at the neck. the shoulders of both seemed to fit the same, with maybe a tad mo"
0,"Maeve...has failed on this Maeve is one of my favorite retailer designers. usually fall in love with a blouse, only to look at the tag and discover it's by maeve (go figure).
this top is just atrocious though. does nothing for girls with a larger chest. very boxy and unflattering. gorgeous colors though, and the sleeve concept is cute. however, where the sleeve meets the shirt looks cheap and thrown on. not impressed."
1,"For straight figures This sweater dress was incredibly soft, and i loved the button detail down the back. unfortunately, i'm an hourglass figure (32dd with 26'' waist). this sweater did nothing to flatter me. i tried it in 2 different sizes; the ps looked far too big on, but the pxs created an awkward baggy area in my midsection while fitting nicely elsewhere. the petite length was great - i am 5'1 and i would not have wanted it any shorter. wish this was a little more tapered in the waist, because the quality is lo"
1,"Never turning back. Was in dire need of black high rise skinny jeans. bought these in a moment of ""treat yo' self"" mentality. absolutely do not regret it. at 5'7"", 27-28 waist, typically a 28 in denim - i got the 27s as i found that they not only fit in the waist, but were more slimming. black ""denim"" typically stretches out in jeans as they are not of the same fabric - these have a great weight, perfect ratio of thickness:stretch, look incredibly sleek paired with anything. high rise keeps my belly in check, and a"
1,"Pretty, stylish, romantic top I bought the white version of this beautiful top in the store yesterday, this romantic top is beautifully detailed, very soft, comfortable and flattering. there is a thin cotton liner underneath too. fits true to size with enough room in the bust to not be too tight."
1,Stunning Colors are much more vibrant in person. love this skirt. true to size. makes a statement and is still classy.
1,"Too studious for words Love this blouse. the owl design is flawless front to back. the material has a silk like feeling. i would say the arms a slightly tighter than i would prefer. if you have larger arms or have any muscle the sleeves may be tight on you. also, i am a 38 c and the chest fit well (in size large), but would not offer much more room for a larger chest. if you want a looser and relaxed fit as the model shows, i would size up. i love the unique design!"
1,"Beautiful yet simple Such a lovely shirt and even though it is white, flowing and delicate it is not see-through so you will not have to worry about wearing an undershirt in the summer sun. lovely top!"
1,"Adorable, versatile top for summer This is really one of those items that hits it out of the park. first, the fit is great. it's relaxed without being oversized or tapering way out or way in or something odd like that. it's nearly universally flattering to most body types and it's easy to wear with nearly anything. shorts, jeans, trousers, pencil skirts.....it looks great dressed up or down. 

i also like that the pleats that create the ruffle are sewn nicely (sometimes my recent purchases from retailer have not been the best qua"
1," This top is everything it promises to be. i read other reviews and purchased a small (i'm typically between an x-small/small depending on the day of the week) and was glad i did. a medium would definitely have been too big but the small fit perfectly. i have a shorter torso (5'3""/117 pounds) so i didn't experience any apprehension about my stomach showing. i paired it with a pair of skinny black ankle pants and a pair of navy and grey d'orsay heels. it worked wonderful and i can't wait to pair i"
1,"Flattering and comfortable Love these sateen jeans. they are a bit more polished than regular, flat black jeans, but not too shiny. i am 5'9"" and always wear a 27 in ag jeans and these were consistent with my usual size and fit perfectly. the mid-rise is very comfortable and the length on me is about the same as on the model (hits above my ankles). they're easy to dress up or down, and i have a feeling i'll be getting a lot of use out of them."
1,"Cutest dress If you are in between sizes order smaller size. adorable dress. boots or booties look adorable with it. denim jacket or dress it up. can go either way!  colors are beautiful. i ordered the small and medium and kept the small. i did have it shortened. for reference, i am 5'4. 120 pounds."
1,Unique design but runs small This bikini bottom is great design and quality but runs small. overall i would recommend.
1,"Beautiful! I agree with other reviewers, this print is beautiful, i'd love to see the artists other work...
however, the price is steep for sure!
i was hoping to wear this with my skinny jeans but it is waaaay too short for that! i have an extra long torso so this is not an unusual problem for me, but this one is worse than usual almost like a crop top. unlike other reviewers tho, i would not want to size up. it fits snugly but not tight. the fabric doesn't give much tho, so if you're on the verge of siz"
1,"Sadly, not for me The colors look better in person and the sweater knit is thinner than i expected (which is actually a plus in my opinion) so i was very happy when i opened the package, unfortunately the fit was off for me. the lower part and the back are perfect, the dress hangs nicely, no puffing, no stiffness. however, the upper part at the front was tight and something about the armholes made my arms and upper body look beefy (i promise i usually don't have this problem). i am 32a and routinely order xs. the"
1," I adored this when i saw it online, paired with the leather skirt. i waisted impatiently for it to show up and, when it did, was happy at the price point but unsure of how it would feel. for the cut, i would say it runs tts. i am sometimes an xxs but in this case that size was tight across the shoulders. i am worried that the xs will be too roomy in the waist but time will tell. as for quality, well, you can feel the polyester in it, for sure. it's nice to have the lining, but i would not say it"
0,Lovely color but... This sweater dress color is great and texture is nice however ran huge. read the other reviews before ordering and ordered down to a medium and was just to boxy and could not get it to hang well. unfortunately it went back.
1,Beautiful! I just received this blouse and love it...more beautiful in person..i got the black one in a petite and it is perfect...if you want it longer in the front order a regular.
1,"Gorgeous, flowy skirt! I love, love, love this skirt. it's comfortable and attention getting. i receive compliments whenever i wear it -- and i feel great wearing it. colors are much more vivid than on the website -- that's a plus!"
1,Love this sweater! I absolutely love this sweater. it is a great quality sweater dress and a beautiful color. so comfy and warm too. i never want to take it off. definitely one of my favorite purchases from retailer.
1," These pants are adorable as pajamas or maybe something very casual to wear to the beach, but they honestly do not seem like something that a grown woman would wear in public. they are good quality and fit nicely, but i feel like if you're over 20, they're not really flattering or especially appropriate."
1,"Wonderful and unique! If you are like i am and love coats that stand out......this is for you. there are many +++++++++'s first being the quality, embellishment like this coat has can easily go crafty and this coat does not, also the bead work and trim is sewn beautifully with no loose threads visible to me. it is hard to see the bead work but it pops just right, colors are wonderful and fit is tts. it also,looks great belted and much nicer in person....."
1,"So pretty This dress immediately caught my eye in the store. the colors are vibrant and the cut is flattering. i wear a smaill and it fit perfectly, the sweater material is not thick so it can be worn all year. it is very versatile."
1,"Nice medium weight fabric I decided to give these trousers a try, despite my reservations about the appropriateness of the flowered embroidery on the fabric, given my age. girls and younger women can wear these types of pattern in public, but not me. for me, it seems too much like pajama wear, so wearing them as house clothing also didn't appeal to me. i'll be returning them.

the length is why i took off one star. how many petites have a 31"" inseam? i would need to have them hemmed. if you're looking for loose fitting,"
1,"Amazing but very large! I love this dress?sophisticated and amazing?fabulous fabric. however, if you are petite and take a 0, it will be enormous! i am trying to decide if i send it back or have it altered."
1,"Great top! Love this top! wore with jeans, comes to about mid hip so good coverage. fit was perfect for me!"
0,"Wasn't a good fit I really thought from the picture that the dress would be more fit for a curvy figure. it is, unfortunately, more well suited to those women with straighter lines. the color was more flat than the picture as well, but i bet it is lovely in navy."
1,"Pretty, but very small. This top is really pretty, however i found it to be super small. i know meadow rue tends to run small, but this small was like an extra small. i'm not large chested either . if you are super straight/thin with a long torso this is the top for you."
1,"Love! I got this in black and have no issue wearing a solid black bra under it. i felt it ran a little big. i'm a 34dd and usually have to wear a medium due to the ""girls"" but a small fit me and fit well. i didn't find it boxy and it fit me perfectly in the shoulders. i paid full price but i loved it so much i didn't mind. the sale price is amazing!"
1,"Beautiful and quirky! This may be one of my favorite purchases from retailer in a long time. i really appreciate the unique design, a quality that has drawn me to retailer for years. the cute little quirky owls are as rich in color as they are in personality. i'm don't typically favor cheaper polyester blends though the texture feels fine on my skin. this top definitely runs small and i had to size up to get the fit and length i desired. overall, i am very pleased and have received lots of compliments after wearin"
1,"So pretty but be careful I am 5'6"" and 140b, i'm usually a s and that is the size i bought. i loved the fit of the top and wore it immediately. then i washed it just as the instructions said and the liner shrunk about 3"" (just as another reviewer stated) and the sleeves were much tighter and a little shorter. however, i loved the top so much that i took the top back to the store and exchanged. the store was super understanding about it and i was able to order the same size. it's back ordered, but once i get the new top"
1,"Beautiful top Loved the material and the feel. however, it does run a bit large on the shoulders so i had to return."

1,"I recommend with caveats I splurged on this top and was sadly disappointed. i'm a 36d, and the l was so tight i couldn't get it over my chest. also the arms were super tight and the length is nearly cropped.  and the fabric is shiny, the picture makes it look like it's matte. if it did fit like the model i would've loved it. the print is beautiful though. bummer"
1," This is a beautiful dress, just not for me though. since i'm 5'10"" it hit me 2-3"" over my knees. the colors are vibrant- would look good on most!"
1,"Feminine flutter! My heart's a-flutter for this top. the fabric has an excellent weight and feel to it, and the little, fluttery cap sleeves are to die for. i've ordered this in almost every color because it is such a great staple. it is a gorgeous pairing with the marala knit skirt (especially in green,) and the double stripe jacquard skirt, but i'm certain it would be a perfect choice for any pencil skirt. it's so flattering and comfortable, with a neckline that is perfect for single strand pearls or similar le"
1,"Flattering and work-appropriate spring dress Fits like a dream: not too tight, not too loose. arm holes aren't too big (a common problem for me in sleeveless retailer tops/dresses), the sweater material isn't itchy, and the pattern is unusual and eye-catching. i felt confident in this dress and received many compliments. great addition to the spring wardrobe."
1,"Huge This is absolutely huge.  it felt like it was at least 2 sizes too big - the empire waist wasn't even semi- fit.  36d chest and size small was like a tent.  however, the embroidery was beautiful"
1,Adorable and comfortable The top does run large around the upper waist area. arms fits perfectly for athletic shoulders and biceps! the sleeves come about 4 inches shy of the wrist. the embroidery is lovely and the material is very soft but is pretty thin. overall i am very happy that this tunic is actually a tunic! the length goes below the butt and is a very cute buy.
1,"Great dress! In contrast to the other reviewer, i love this dress. worth the sale price at least."
1,"Cute ankle jean! These are great, but unfortunately ran small for me in comparison to my other pilcro jeans. i returned and the size i need is sold out now."

0,This dress is awful!!!!!!! An awful dress! retailer why didn't you post my last review. i would not even give it a quarter of a star.
1,Great fit for size 12 I love pilco jeans - they fit in all the right ways for a size 12. this is a great pair of everyday casual jeans. a tiny bit oversized in the ankle (a bit of a flair) but overall i am very happy! very comfortable.
0,"Love rockets, hated these Recently started loving rockets. i own a pair in black and a pair that are distressed. i've found that the 27s fit me best. i am 5'7"", 34c, 28 waist. this particular pair seems to run true to size, meaning i could get the 28s on (which is typically what i wear in other brands), but the 27s were embarassingly too small. while the 28s fit, and are made of a great weighty denim, with very little stretch, the wash was really not appealing. due to the distressing of the wash, all the lines butterfly"

0,"Top part is gorgeous; bottom part is not My favorite colors are purple and green, so when i was in the store and saw the beautiful purple flowers on the top of this blouse and all up and down the sleeves, i was was blown away. i was disappointed by the bottom of it, just huge, flowy, green fabric with no design on it whatsoever. i went with my first impression and bought it, but now that i'm trying it on in the house, i'm still bothered by the throw-away bottom of this blouse. i'm thinking this is just another retailer maternity t"
1,Compliment after compliment... I can't tell you how many compliments i get on this gorgeous sweater/poncho! there are tiny glimmery threads woven into it that make it so fun for dressing up. i wore it to a fall holiday party and it was perfect! it's a little on the itchy side... but the shirt i wore underneath solved the problem. the colors are so gorgeous... deep and rich. love this piece!

0,"Birds of paradise! I love this suit! the pattern is just lovely. unfortunately i have to return the suit because i can't wear it. there are no cups or pads or underwire for the chest. you have to look like the model wearing the suit to wear this. if you need any support than give up. who can wear an xl and not have some breasts at all? the neckline is also very low and ended up revealing the top half of my breasts.

the birds of paradise are just lovely, not exactly the same on every suit, but still nice. i just"
1," It's a lovely pattern on a soft tee. the fit is similar to how it looks on the model, not clingy at all. it should be noted that it's fairly see-through. if i wear a bra that's close to skin color it's not an issue, but it is obvious if you're wearing any kind of patterned or contrasting bra. i suppose you could wear a cami underneath, but it's too hot for that in florida and i think it defeats the purpose of a t-shirt. overall, i'm very happy with this, though i'm also very very happy i got thi"
1,Very pretty and different I loved this t-shirt. i got the grey one in small. i'm a size 2 and 5'3. it is a relaxed fit. i love it because it is a bit different and the flowers add a nice flair. i didn't want t plan t shirt but i also didn't want anything too crazy. fits well and is soft too.
1,"Nice t-shirt!! This is a very nice quality t-shirt. i loved the material & colors. i got it on sale and the only reason i had to return it because it was small on me. due to the nice sale, another size was not available."
1,"Going to be a summer staple! When i saw this shirt, i knew i had to have it! i got the white with yellow flowers, and the pattern is perfectly charming. i'm 5'2"" and petite with a short torso. the petite xs fit me perfectly! the material is pretty thin, so i hope it stays in good shape. until then, i can't wait to dress this up for work and dress it down for casual summer days."

0,"Pretty colors, more cropped than anticipated I am about 5'6"", 135 lbs and usually wear between a small or a medium. i ordered a small, as another reviewer did. right when i took it out of the packaging, i could see that it was going to be much shorter than you can tell from the online photo. i knew the sweater was going to be cropped, but it falls right at the top of my hip bones. when i raise my arms up, my whole midriff shows. did not flatter my athletic build at all. the fit around the shoulders and chest is fine, skimming but not tight"
1,"Beautiful graphic design, very small! Although $$$$$ i want to support usa products and am so glad retailer continues to add these options .i also decided to splurge with family coming home for the holidays, a way to stay in pajamas but still look dressed. i am only 5'2"" and these were just longer than capri length, more like the close-up view online. to get them ankle length you would have to push them way down on your hips, not sure how the tall model did that! i am 106 lbs and considered exchanging the xs for an s, these run"
1,"Adorable but see through The tee is adorable in the floral print. the fit is true to size, as it is a casual tee rather than overly fitted. the cuffed sleeves are a nice detail. i would have bought this at full price, but it is quite see through in the white/yellow floral. i could easily see my nude colored bra and even my belly button it was so sheer. having to wear a tank underneath this completely defeats the purpose of a cute, casual tee you can just throw on. i was so disappointed that it was so sheer. i think the"
1,Love this shirt in gray I love the cut and fit of this t. it's soft and has just enough flow to be comfortable without being unflattering. the gray floral print is very pretty. it's perfect with jeans or shorts in the summer.
1,"Ego booster Cute shirt but it is very hard to wrap my head around being an xxs. sizing is ridiculous. and now that i have an xs that is too big, the xxs are sold out. typical."
1,"Comfortable t-shirt This is casual and comfortable.
along with soft touch of its textile, i also like the pastel color of flower prints. 
especially, i love the purple flower print with grey background (which is sold out already).
it also fits well with my body and makes look cool. 

it is perfect for everyday use."
1,"Sunshine on a t-shirt! This color came out after i had purchased the same in the gray motif. when i saw this one, though, i simply had to have it! it is such a happy print and different color scheme from anything else in my closet. i had purchased the gray one in regular only because the petites were all sold out, but i was able to get this one in my usual small petite size. it is most definitely a better fit/length for me. i don't usually like to pay so much for a t-shirt, but i will splurge for something like this t"
1," I love this t-shirt, i wish it came in tons of other prints! very soft, almost feels lived in, and high quality all the same."
1," These shorts just didn't work for me. i loved the embroidery and the color, but i just don't have the curves for them. try these if you have an hourglass or fuller figure."
0,Shorts Very nice fabric and quality but runs very large. i had to return my pair of a size 0. stinks to pay for shipping on a product that looks so different in the picture.
1,"Stunning dress! I have a closet filled with black lace dresses but this one is my new favorite!
the style is classic with an unexpected yet still elegant twist.
i ordered my usual size and found it to run a little on the small side, especially in the waist.
this is one dress you need to have in your closet.
if you are in between sizes i would suggest going up one size."
1,"Watercolor look Tshirt is beautiful. looks like watercolor. the fabric is a thin soft cotton that is really nice. i am 5'6"" and very thin. xs fit well and was not too short. s would have been fine too. i would choose a size by your shoulder width. i bought my mother the medium."
1,"Beautiful short! These shorts were just what i expected from retailer. they are more pretty in person, particularly for the color - like a rich clay color, not garish orange. very good quality fabric & the embroidery around the edges is unique. i'm usually a size small in bottoms from retailer & the s fits perfectly."
1,Love this Very soft! i sized up. was able to wear without a cami underneath
1,A+ tee I tried on about 25 items in the store today and didn't buy anything but if i had bought just one thing it would have been this great floral t-shirt (i may have to go back for it). the combination of the very soft material and faded look of the pattern gives it the look and feel of an old favorite tee shirt. the fit is exceptional as well- not too loose or too snug. i would definitely snap it up on sale and may even have to cave to the full price.
1,"Why is this cute but simple shirt so expensive It's a t-shirt. a very cute print, nice cut, very soft--but a t-shirt. therefore, why is it almost $50???? tried it on in the store and loved it, but i just can't justify $50 for a t-shirt.

for those who will not be deterred by the price: i normally wear about an 8-10 dress size at retailer, and the medium fit well."
1,"Beautiful blouse Love this shirt! i love florals so the bright pretty yellow just had to be mine. it is true to size, perfect neckline- not too low or high and very flattering. see through enough to require a cami, but worth it. very soft fabric and really comfy."
1,"This tee makes me happy! I got the xs and it fits perfectly, almost an a line cute slightly fuller on the bottom, not too form fitting and not too loose. i am 5'1"" and the length is not short as it appears in the photo on the model. the yellow flower pattern is super cute. material is soft and comfy."
1, This tee is very pretty - i purchased it in the grey/purple combo. i usually wear a medium in this brand just because i don't like my tees to be fitted but i found this one to be a little too loose for me so i should have sized down to a small.
1,"Cute tee This tee is so soft and comfy. it looks nicer than a regular tee but still casual. fits true to size, and not too loose, but not too clingy. i know i'll wear this one a lot!"
0,"Not as advertised! I like the look of this tee and the fit is fine but it's described as a ""cotton-rayon jersey"" and in fact it's 50% polyester. i would not have ordered if i had known and now have to take it back."
1,"Super soft t-shirt I loved this t-shirt in the gray motif so much, went back to get the yellow:-) both go great with pilcro hyphen chinos. while the fabric is a little thin, it's super soft and just the perfect length."
1,Cute print I ordered the yellow. i love this shirt it such a happy print. can match a lot of things.
0,"So cute but not a great fit I wear an 8-10 and these are a little big on me, which is surprising. they also don't lay really flat in the back. the pockets are inside in the back, in side two layers, and don't lay very flat. the crotch is low and rides up when i walk.
i'll probably wear them again, but i'm not totally thrilled by them."
1,"Vintage beauty I don't know why i didn't pay much attention to this tee (the yellow), but i didn't. i saw it in the store, thought it was interesting and kept on going. then i really looked at it online and suddenly i had a bad case of the wants. so when i was in one of my local stores i asked about it, and no surprise, it was sold out. at the suggestion of my sales associate i tried on a solid one just for the size. although i'm small, i have several tla tees in medium, so i tried on a medium and a small. as"
1,Just what i expected! I was looking for some comfortable but still stylish shorts for the weekend. these hit the mark!
1," This t- shirt is adorable. i saw this in the catalog and ordered it immediately- despite the $50 price tag. cute with jeans, khakis, shorts, under a denim jacket, the options are endless. print is very cute but the sizing and quality left something to be desired. the material is extremely thin- it will be a matter of time before holes develop... no matter how careful you are. i ordered a large to be roomy and it was way too big."
1,"Beautiful skirt I love everything about this skirt, except that it adds bulk to the waist and/or hip area because of lots of fabric and pleating.   i still love it and when i place the waist band higher on my waist looks super cute with a dainty blouse tucked in.   i'm 5'4 105 and have a tiny belly  pooch that comes and goes through out the day so although this skirt is beautiful it tends to magnify the tiniest of belly pooches and hips.  i think i love the skirt too much to retun."
1,Love this t-shirt Such a great purchase! it can be dressed up or down and seems to go with everything! great for summer!
1," The shirt is darling, soft and relaxed fit. i usually wear an xs or small in most retailer tops. unfortunately, i ordered an xs and should have ordered the small. i found the length to be a little short in the xs so i'm sending it back to exchange for the small. i hope it's just a little bit longer."
1,"Runs small but cute These pants are really cute but definitely run small - i ordered a large so they would be a little bigger for lounging and they are not very stretchy. the large fits more like a small in regular sweatpants. there is more blue visible in the top and bottom part of the pants as well, which i like."
1,"Fits nicely but fabric a bit thin I ordered this on-line. while it fits well before washing, the fabric is a bit thin. i'm afraid it might shrink in the wash, too. i haven't worn it yet because i'm trying to decide it i will keep it or return it. colors are a bit more muted than i would like also."
1,Pretty tee Nice print and comfortable shirt.
1,"So cute! I just received this jumpsuit and was so excited.  unfortunately it is too small and will have to go back.  the top is so cute and the material is thick so no need for a bra which i really liked.  it runs short in the stride and also in the top.  i ordered a petite since i am only 5'0"" tall and was very surprised how short the stride was.  the length was great and would love to have been able to kept it."
1,"Very comfy- dress up or down Tried these on several times in store and never bought them, but was able to get them with a 20% email- seemed like a better price for the product. the color is rust and a little odd for my wardrobe - wish they also came in black. love the style and they are very comfortable, perfect for late summer- can wear on errands or dress them up a little with shoes/accessories for casual dinner out. happy i finally purchased them!"
1,"Nice weight Seems like all i wear all summer are solid colored tees with shorts or skirts. decided this summer i would have patterns! and color! this is a great t-shirt. nice weight. pretty pattern. i found the length on the small to fit my frame perfectly. an xs probably would be good too, but i hate having my favorite t-shirts shrink to unwearable so i always start a little bigger."
1,"Cute, cute!! Literally the only reason i am giving this 4 stars is because of my history with this brand (holes developing after minimal wear). i will do my usual wash but don't dry and hope it holds up!

material: super soft and comfortable, almost slubby. i haven't seen the yellow in person, the purple/grey is lovely. 

fit: moderate scoop neck as pictured (almost oval) that's a nice touch as it's not too low or high at the neck. not overly fitted over the chest or stomach - without being oversized - j"
1,"Love it! I bought the grey version of this shirt in-store because of the cute pattern, soft material, and versatility of wear; you can dress it up for work or wear with jeans/shorts for a more casual look. the beautiful purples, greens, and blues of the roses look like a water color painting, and stand out against the grey background. i've already received multiple complements from co-workers and friends, and liked it so much myself i bought the other two colors! personally i think it runs a bit large, s"
1,"The perfect tee! Love the fit, feel and colors of this tee. looks great with white jeans, blue jeans and is so springy. longer in length than most tees which is a plus for me. may run a tad small since i am usually an xs in most tops but i bought a s and love the fit."
1,"Cute pattern I love t-shirts by t la, but unfortunately this particular one was different. the sizing was off. it ran small, although i ordered my usual size medium for this brand. i think the shirt is cute though;)"
1,"Very pretty, but . . . This blouse is very pretty, but the overlap in the front is a little ""strange."" it seems to fall open and will require either a pretty pin to hold it closed or a cami underneath. despite that ""flaw"" i am glad that i purchased this blouse. the trim at the shoulders gives it a romantic and special appeal."
1,"Soft & beautiful! The sweater and skirt are so pretty! they're really soft and have such an easy, comfortable look together. really love this gorgeous outfit.

i am borderline small/medium and kept the size small after trying both on."
1,"Snow day loungers So soft and comfortable and flattering on! run small. i'm a 25/0 pant and a small in these is as small as i'd want to go! otherwise, excellent."
1, I really like this brand. i bought the t-shirt in the gray and the red color. the sizing is different for the colors. i kept the gray in a small and had to get a medium in the red color. they wash very nicely.
1,Cute shirt 7 months pregnant with twins and i prefer to buy regular clothes that can be worn post pregnancy as well as when pregnant. went to a dr. apt and the receptionist loved this shirt. i told her it was non-maternity and she can buy it at retailer... i think she stopped by on her way home from work.
1,Super soft Great transition into fall. super soft and comfy. great yellow without being too yellow love it.
1,"Beautiful top I bought yellow one, and i'm very happy with this purchase. the flower print is beautiful, and the material is light, but not too thin. i love wearing this top with a pair of blue denim or a pair of white bottom.
i'm pretty short in height and size 36c. i bought a m in regular size because i like my tops roomy, and it fits really nice, i just tie a small knot on the bottom of this top or tuck the shirt in a little bit, it works perfect."
1,"So soft! This shirt is so comfortable and soft. it has a great fit. it is a little thin, but i can get away with wearing it by itself. i love it!"
1,"Nice summer weight t Pros: versatile summer weight t. perfect with jeans. flattering cut. nice color palette. made in the usa. reasons for not giving 5's for overall rating and quality... shirt is a bit short overall (i'm 5'4). fabric is thin and a mixed blend of poly, cotton, and rayon. will have to be careful with washing. better if you can purchase on sale. regular price was steep for a t-shirt."
1,"Love!!!! I love this tee!!! i bought the red, and it is just so cute. the background is a light pink - and there are accents of deeper rose and mint green. i also bought the angel of the north cascade cardigan in rose, which looks great over this tee. buy it!"
1,"Spring time tee I purchased this towards the end of winter because it reminded me of spring time! it is such a lovely soft tee, with a delicate flower design. i wear it with jeans. it always makes me feel happy."
1,"Great tee Great fabric, great fit, great shirt. just found my new favorite for this summer!!"
1,"Cute tee - don't love the material This is a cute tee but only if you get it on sale. i don't love the material. it seems flimsy and likely to get holes quickly. the pattern is pretty cute but nothing special. glad i got it on sale. as with all retailer tees, size down. xs works good for me."
0,"Fabric is pretty thin I purchased this in the yellow for my daughter and she has not seen it yet. the style is very cute, but the fabric is quite thin. she will have to make that call, but if i had bought it for myself, it would be going back. i'm not willing to wear a camisole under a t-shirt. it also feels like the kind of knit fabric that shrinks and skews when it's washed, so that remains to be seen."
1,New favorite shorts These shorts are wonderful! very stylish and easy to pair with my tops. they do run a bit large. i am normally a size 8 or 29. i ordered these in a medium and i definitely could have gone with small. they are machine washable though and i'm not sure if they will shrink at all so i'm keeping them. i would definitely recommend them.
1,Theres just something about this shirt! I debated forever about ordering this and so glad i did! the colors are so pretty. i got the yellow and it's slightly sheer but ok w/ a nude bra. regarding fit- completely tts imo. i'm a 8/10 and 38 c and the med is perfect. i am so happy i did not size up.
1,"Runs extremely small I ordered this dress when it was briefly on sale with an extra percent off. i was very excited to receive it in my usual size large, and wear with a jean jacket and cowboy boots. when i took it out of the package, i could tell it looked really small. i didn't even try it on. i had my daughter who wears a size small try it on, and she couldn't even get it over her hips. if you are tall and thin like the model, it will work for you. it is made of cupro, looks exactly like the photo, the color is g"
1,"Surprisingly cute! I got this piece because it was so unique.. that's one of the things i love so much about retailer: not afraid to go where no woman has gone before, so i ordered it in a 4p, my usual size, and a 4. i am petite, but the 4 worked perfectly, i think. i am pretty voluptuous below the waist and medium to small on the top and the 4p was too small all over - so i would agree that it runs small.

the quality is excellent, the look is great. my husband liked it on me. it might work for the office with so"
1,"So beautiful! I bought this at the store and when i picked it up i didn't think much of it until i tried it on! it is so adorable, i can't even tell you how much... i am 48 yo and normaly buy xs/s or 2/4 in retailer. mauve dresses are 2 most of the time. small chest, 5'5"" and about 130lbs and i got the size 4 and it is perfect! i hope it is age appropriate tho... ;) i have traveling plans this summer and i am thinking this could be an easy thing to take along with me, one piece clothing that will travel very we"
1,Great sweater I absolutely love this sweater. it is a beautiful deep blue color. i love the unique cuff on the sleeves.. i feel it does run a bit big but once you pull the strings it shortens up dramatically. looking forward to late summer and early fall so i can wear it!
1,"Comfy go-to cardigan I bought this online days before my trip to seattle. i read the reviews so was aware it runs large...and it does. i practically lived in it the whole time i was there. it's very comfortable and once it cools down here in so cal i'll be back in it. some reviewers mentioned it bunched up when tied but didn't like the ties hanging loose. i just looped each one and it works great. 
it really runs large. i bought their smallest size and had ample room."
1,"Super cute and fitted I tried this one without a bra, and t was fine... a little droopy but i could go without.
the things that bothered me: the pattern wasn't even on both sides, so where the seem is on the legs by the wait, didn't match... some people may not be annoyed by that, but hard for me not to look at.
also, the length on the model is just below the knee. i usually order petite, but tried on regular size in the store... i liked it like that, the hem went to below the big part of my calf, so it 3was flatte"
1," I was immediately drawn to this tunic at the store. it has my favorite colors in it. blue and orange. as one reviewer said, the print is eye-catching. the feel of the material is soft. i am 5' tall so it fits on me like a dress, although if you are a taller person, the slits on the side may be higher on the frame. this is definitely one of my favorite tunics now."
1," I bought this awesome jumpsuit and i love it ! i really don't like wearing one piece clothing but this one its just so comfy and it looks great, i wear it with the straps or strapless and it looks different, as you can wear it classy or casual. and the best park, it has side pockets ! the color is as the description, navy blue and ivory/cream pattern. i wear a size 2. and that's what i got when i bought this, so pretty much to size for my  liking."
1,So flattering Make sure to get the whole outfit. the skirt sits high enough so that it avoids the muffin look.
0,"Jeunet I found this dress to be beautiful. only down side? you'd need to size up two sizes if you have any breasts or butt. i'm usually size s/m in maeve. i bought this in l and looked like a stuffed sausage. i'm 5'1"", 140lbs, 36d, 39"" hips. i'd need an xl."
1,Fun and adorable! I love this sweater! i tried it on at the store and had to purchase! it's even cuter on! i am normally between a small and a medium but decided on the small as it has a loose look. perfect weight for summer!
1,"Too roomy in the bust for me I ordered this in my usual retailer size, xspetite and it was too baggy in the bust. granted, i'm only a 34aa, but i would still expect it to be a little smaller in the bust at that size. the elastic waist was a little loose too (i have a 26"" waist, 34"" hips) and the inner slip showed a tiny bit like another reviewer said but it's the same fabric as the dress. the slip is adjustable but it's attached to the dress at the waist. it wasn't flattering on me in the hips either. this was a miss for me b"
1,Stylish and comfortable The material is structured enough to flatter the body. only concern was over time the straps may wither as they are thin. very happy with the style and comfort of this jumpsuit. pockets on side are also useful yet discreet.
1,"Beautiful dress I absolutely love this dress. beautiful, flattering shape with flowing light weight fabric. i'm so in love with this color. a great dress for a special night."
1,"Love this dress! The fit of the dress is fabulous! it is so flattering and true to size. my only complaint is that he lining can be seen at the neckline. it might just be that the one i received is slightly defective. even with this problem, it is a keeper."
1,"Love I just received this. it is adorable! well made with attention to detail. the cotton is soft and it hugs the body well in the right places. the pattern is actually sewn into the cotton. very cool. it has a sophisticated, elegant and urban vibe to it. this one is a winner."
1,"Supah cute! So glad i gave this a try. looks so much better on than seeing it online!!! i doubt i will ever wear it tied, but it's very cute and comfortable. it will probably be my go-to sweater to throw on over summer clothes when the ac is too cold. it would even be great to throw on over workout clothes! 
fits tts."
1," I love this soft, glistening, flowy beauty!  it's my favorite color too!  i'm 5'5"", 34d, size 6 and a small fit me with room to spare.  don't wait!"
1,"Finally the spring coat i've been looking for! Ahh it's delightful! it's a little short in the fit, but it's so cute. and didn't cost an absurd amount like some more heavy weight or full trench coats. love it."
1," Love ag jeans!! a little on the pricey side...but so worth it. the harper style is just enough higher wasted so i can actually bend over and not worry about anyone seeing anything other than my jeans :) but not too high waisted. these jeans keep their shape still with a little strestch to them. i am 5'5,, and 111 lbs and if not wearing under boots would have to a0 alter or b) wear as these are in the picture because they'd be too long for me. but i would purchase these all over again. love these"
1,"Not for the petite I love the design and color of this cardigan, and the way it was styled in the store display made me snatch one up right away. but unfortunately, it's huge and shapeless (i tried size xs/s) and i'm a waif (5'2"", 105#) - i think it could drape nicely on a tall woman but if you are small to average in height it'll hang down somewhere mid-thigh or even lower. you can snug up the ties, as they are threaded through the cardigan like a drawstring, but that just made it look bunchy and even more shapel"
1,"Love these jeans! They have some stretch, so if you are between sizes, order down. they are very long, which for me is a good thing!"
1,Love ag jeans Love love these jeans. they are just the right rise and the straight leg is perfect. the color of the demin is great to wear to work. the fit is great.
1,"Beautiful color and fabric I really like the soft, flowy satin fabric and vibrant color of this dress! i am 5'5'' 125lbs, the s was too large, so i ordered the xs instead. things to note: pockets, elastic waistband with nice detailing on the sides, slip underneath, and large flutter sleeves. i think that women with smaller torsos should consider petite sizing."
1,Great pair of jeans! I wear a 10/12. i bought a 30/31 and they fit perfect in every way! they were even almost too long so i can wear with heels if i want. i am so glad i bought these. don't let the folded cuff in the picture deceive you. a great pair of straight leg jeans!
1,"Wow The model doesn't do this jumpsuit justice. absolutely gorgeous!  beautifully constructed,  cute details,  flows well,  easy to dress up or down...
5'5"" 135 34 c- the 6 was perfect."
1,"Unique and flattering The fabric and design of this piece are so unique.  i am skeptical of wide leg designs in product photos because the fabric is often much more voluminous irl than it appears, which is the case for this jumpsuit.  despite the extra volume, the fabric weight gives it a structured look which makes the wide legs look fantastic on.  there is a silicon grip band around the top that allows you to wear it strapless, though it doesn't seem very functional to me without boning or more structure to the sid"
1,"Lovely with one complaint This looks great on. i'm busty, so it's a little awkward to zip under the armhole, but not bad. a little bit tight in the bust, but the smocked back stretches to accommodate. 
i just wish the description had mentioned that it has silicone gripper across the front neckline. i have a sensitivity to this type of coating/elastic and generally avoid it, since it causes my skin to turn red and break out in blisters. the jumpsuit looks so great on that i will keep it and either remove the gripper or s"
0,"Just okay The fit on these is good for my hourglass shape, and the fabric quality and comfort is good too.i think the rinse is just not as nice in person- the orange stitching is pretty bright too. i bought. a pair from br a couple months ago that are almost identical in quality, fit and color that i got for less than half the price of these. i am going to return these and see if they have something better , but will only buy in store from now on."
1,"Jeans are the best!!! Love these jeans! fit great and can be causal or dressy! what i appreciate is that you can wear them with flats, boots and heels so worth the cash!"
1,Flattering! The quality of the fabric and the design are perfect. i love the cut out and how flattering on my shorter figure. i am somewhere between a 6 and 8 and the 6 fit perfectly. it can also be strapless which is a sexier version.
1,"The best spring purchase yet! This jacket is perfect and drapes very well. i had my eye on it online and the second i put it on, it was a ""yes"". if you are between sizes, as one reviewer mentioned, size down. it's tts but has a little extra room for me on the 2, so i sized down to 0. 5'4"" 115lbs."
1,"Beautiful design but for those smaller in bust I wanted this jumpsuit to work so badly. my regular size 2 crushed my ""girls"" flattening them and pushing them up over the top of the jumpsuit. unfortunately i had to go up 2 dress sizes to get it to fit around my bust but was then so big that the material in the front was gapping and folding over. for reference i am not overly busty, a 34 c with petite but muscular build."
1,Great jeans! This is my first pair of ag and i love them so far. they are not cuffed as shown in the picture. they are long so i had to get them altered (i'm 5''5). the color is a rich blue and they have a nice stretch. i haven't worn them all day yet to see if they keep their shape. usually a 28 or 29 and went with the 28 on these. got them on 20 perc off sale so very happy!
1,Great fit! I love these pants! so comfortable and can be dressed up and dressed down! love them!
1,"The ""gateway jumpsuit"" I'm calling this the ""gateway jumpsuit"" for all those ladies who are wondering about this whole jumpsuit trend and how they feel about it--you know who you are. this jumper is flattering, comfortable, elevated--and worth trying on! i'm petite but long-waisted with curves on the bottom, which can be a tough combo when trying to find a jumper. i actually ordered the petite 2 first, which was better fitting in the waist area but i ended up ultimately purchasing the regular 2 since i preferred where"
1," Love these jeans. comfortable fit, doesn't stretch out too much after wearing a few hours. goes with dress up, lazy day or casual tops. my go-to jeans. wish they came in different washes"
0,"So close I really, really wanted to love this jacket. unfortunately, i have a long torso and it was a weird length on me. it hit touching my waist and i wanted something a little longer. i am 5'6"", but long waisted. this probably fits beautifully on someone more short-waisted or petite in stature. it was beautiful (although the buttons were cheap...)"
1,Polished and comfort I'm 5' 120 lbs. i'm posting a photo. one lady was concerned about it being ok for the over 40 crowd. i wore it was a cami under. see pic. it is comfy. it has pockets and fits beautifully. i ordered a 6petite. it's a little long on me. buy i still like it and am enjoying wearing it.
1,"Thin fabric for fall I like the color of this dress, but its a little thin for fall. on me, the neckline is more round and the sleeves a little cappier. i have dresses in this brand in both a size small and medium. i went with a small in this dress. returning it for a medium."
1, Beautiful detail. fits likes a glove. i have a short torso and design hits perfectly on my waist. may not be good for those with longer torsos. very flattering . arm holes well fitted. no open gaps. i plan to wear this to a november wedding.
1,"Perfect suit for mom on the go! After trying several one piece options i decided to buy this gorgeous tankini. i love the fit - bottoms stay put while running around the beach with my girls, but still stylish. the top is a perfect fit- little lining and halter adjustable tie is flattering on a smaller chest. the material is high quality and i will be living in this all summer long. there is about a two inch gap between the top and bottom."
1,"Pretty & comfy dress I just received this dress yesterday, so to be fair, i have not worn it out in public yet. i am deciding whether or not to keep it. i typically love west coast dolan dresses and this one is no different in looks. it's adorable and would be a great addition to your fall wardrobe. my only concern is the back. the back looks like a wrap dress that's backward - just the bottom half (that probably makes no sense). my worry is that the slightest bit of wind could catch it and the whole thing could ope"
1,"Great little summer dress I've been looking for a black off-the-shoulder dress and found this baby in store today. for reference, i am 5'8"", 34b, 140-150 and took a small. this dress is a shift/swing style, so if you're looking for something fitted this isn't your dress. as another reviewer mentioned, ladies who are busty may not like this as the ruffle at the top could add unwanted volume. if you are extremely thin or petite, i might size down, but i like my clothing loose vs. fitted so i kept the small. the fabric is g"
1,"Perfect summer comfy short! These shorts are super soft and comfortable. i am normally a size 27 or a 2 in shorts. i got a size 26 in these shorts and they are still large. i exchanged them for a 25 and they fit perfectly. so these run 1-2 sizes large. other than sizing, these shorts are perfectly comfortable and functional."
1,"I could live in these. The material is so soft, and lightweight without being sheer. i am 5'1 #145 and ordered a size 28 in blue. they have a relaxed fit, and a polished-casual look."
1,"So worth it! Got these on sale...absolutely love eberjey! fabric is super soft and easy to wash. more ""normal"" than other eberjey styles (not lingerie). i'm 5'6"", 125 lbs and small fit well. i am small busted and there is definitely extra room but doesn't make it fit weird at all. highly recommend!"
1,"Beautiful but doesn't work for large chest I really wanted to love this dress but unfortunately the length of the ruffle up top is not flattering on someone with a large chest. if you are d or smaller, it will probably be perfect. 

great material, color, and feel. so bummed i had to return it"
0," I bought the stained glass top/bottoms. the print is very pretty. however, the tankini top itself is not well-made. the front of it (chest area) turns out so that you can see part of the inside of the suit (which is white). it doesn't lay flat around the top, and so it shows more of your chest on one side. for the price, i don't think it is worth it. i don't like to wear it because it makes me feel uncomfortable."
1,Looks better in person Bought this dress for a wedding in petite. fits true to size. beading & embroidery is beautiful in person. only downside is that the beads & embroidery are very delicate and damage even when sitting on a chair.
1," Super soft shorts. i ordered them in the orange and it's a lovely soft orange. they aren't too short, about mid thigh. i found the 27 to be a little loose on the waist but i was afraid to compromise the length for a size 26. i may order the navy in 26."
1," Not sure why this is considered a top--it's an open front cardigan. also the the maker is monogram/hwr, not knitted & knotted. soft knit, inverted pleat at back yoke, slight flare after the armpits, slightly fitted at shoulders but not restrictive. pretty much looks like the picture! hand stitch elements seem to be the random embroidery sprinkled throughout the sweater. colors are dark blue-black, navy blue, gray, blush, ivory and turquoise. i am 5'3"" 135# 36d 38/28/35 and i purchased size mp."
1,"Perfect tankini top This twist front top fits true to size, it is perfect! i really love the ruched sides, i like a longer tankini but most of them the stomach area is too wide and flowy. this one is perfect, it hugs your sides and looks great to wear with my kids but still flirty with my husband! i got the navy top and the side tie bottoms in navy/periwinkle and they are so cute together, can't wait to hit the beach!!"
1,"Super cute but large As other reviewers have mentioned, this dress runs extremely large. i'm a solid medium in maeve dresses usually and got this dress in the store in a size x-small... and took it to my local seamstress to get it taken in! i get that this is supposed to be a ""swingy"" and ""airy"" dress but there was just too much space and material for me. i loved the top and the soft material so i am ok with spending money to get the waist taken in. i think this would be the perfect dress for someone with a slim fig"
1,"Pretty but not for me This is such a pretty dress but it didn't do much for my figure.  i'm fairly long-waisted and the dress curved in around my lower rib-cage.  also, the beads were falling off everywhere.  i really wanted it to work but it is going back."
1,"Mosaic masterpiece I bought the mosaic pattern in a small. the pattern and colors look much better in person. the design and quality are solid. the top runs small. it is difficult to put on, but stays in place. i would recommend."
1,"At last a true red! Yes these are a true clear red. not neon red or orange red, but a classic shade of red. these pants are so comfortable with just the right amount of stretch. they are a nice weight for spring/summer without being too light or flimsy. they remind me of j crew martie but i like these better. i'd say they fit tts if not slightly on the large side. for reference my waist is 26 and hips are 35. the size 0 fits very well but the 2p were too big. ( i also take a 0 in the martie but those are slightly m"
1,"Lovely for a little while Bought this in the store and fell in love with it. very soft and flattering to wear. however, after wearing it one day it is already starting to pill. this truly is a beautiful sweater, but i fear it will not be beautiful for long. i am willing to take the chance as i got it on sale."
1, Sweater fits great and is nice and soft. i am 5'11 and got a m and the arms and length are perfect for me
1, Bought this is black and white... love them but washed the white by hand and it shrunk...
1,"Beautiful top! I bought this online to wear in my engagement photos, and its absolutely perfect! i typically wear a size l or xl and could have easily worn the l in this top, runs a tad big. keep in mind it is on the shorter side. i will be purchasing a white tank to wear underneath it."
1,"Gorgeous dress This dress is lovely - the soft material is prettier in person and the fit is perfect for me. i found it tts, wearing my normal s. i'm 5'8.5"" and it hits me a little lower towards my ankles than pictured, but doesn't the floor. it will be perfect for an upcoming wedding rehearsal lunch and a go to summer dress after that!"
1,Beautiful top Love this top. i ordered the pink and it was more of a dusty rose. it also runs large - i normally wear a medium top. i am going to exchange it for white in small.
1,Casual and elegant Fun top for day or evening.
1,"Absolutely stunning Loved the one i had in white so much i ordered the green - such a beautiful piece! size seems true to size, and it elevates anything you wear it with; skirt, jeans, shorts....if you are on the fence, jump- you won't be disappointed."
1,"Nice enough I tried the xs in store (white) though it is sold out online, guess i was lucky... the top is pretty sheer, i could wear it with nothing underneath, like on of the sales people did, however, you can see my innie... like a big shadow. i like the look, it is a little boxy, but feminine at the same time. mine fits wide, like the model, why i put as true to size... if there were still some xxs, i might have ordered it. it is a bit edgy, not romantic as some other pieces i have. overall, i like. the"
1,"Pretty lace top The material of the lace is nice and soft, it is not a stiff lace. i am 5'6"" 36dd 146lbs and ordered the small. it fits perfect not tight through bust or the arm holes. i wore today for the first time and everyone that sees the top loves it as much as i do. i ordered the white and in the pictures it looks like a bright white, it is not. it is more of an antique white and i am wearing a nude colored camisole and it works perfect. i think it will be really cute with a colored cami also. this will"
1,"Fabulous fit!! If you've been searching for red crops, gotta give these a try!! i bought my normal size 6 and they fit perfectly! they're a little more snug on me in the butt and thigh than on the model, but they're super flattering and the color is wonderful!! fabric is a tad thin, really stretchy (in a good way), and the weight is great for summer. i haven't worn them yet, so i'm not sure if they'll keep they're shape. fingers crossed!"
1,"Pretty top with chokey neckline This top is very pretty and you can definitely wear it without a cami with a nude bra if you're an outgoing person, especially for a summer evening. my only confusion is the too high neckline. if it was just a little lower, it would look and feel less ""chokey."" i keep wanting to pull it down. i'm a size 0 and needed the xxs which fits like most people's xs's as sizing continues to get bigger. really lovely except for the neckline. looks great over white or colored shorts and is a nice mix of cas"
1,"Runs huge! I am a true size 6 in virtually everything, pants or dress. i was swimming in these! i am reordering a size 2, they were so big."
1,Meant to be I ordered this sweater online in a size xs and the order was cancelled because it was out of stock. i ended up finding a sm at my local retailer and was so happy! it worked just perfectly. i'm usually an xs but the sm worked great. it is a thick knit and may snag so i'm being careful with it. simply meant to be:)
1,Great top for the price! I got the off-white lace top and love it! quality is great for the price. comfortable and the lace isn't super delicate so it seems like it should last.
1,"Soft lace top What a cute top! it's a little on the short side for me (5'7"") but i'm keeping it because it is so pretty. the lace is lightweight and delicate but seems like it will hold up pretty well. trying to decide what to wear under it, but i think it could look cute with a cami for work, or even a cute bra that has some coverage for super casual days. the lace is completely sheer but doesn't feel as revealing as i would expect. would be super cute over a swim top with jean shorts and sandals...wish i li"
0," This top is beautiful and i have received so many compliments on it. the fit is very complimenting, and i would continue to wear it often except that the fabric is unraveling. the bottom of the lace has raw edges so i would expect some fraying there but my top is shedding long streaks of material with each wear throughout the entire top, 1-5"" strands of the lace unraveling isn't exactly a great look."
1,"True red, true beauty. These pants are gorgeous--the fabric has a satiny stretch that simply feels decadent on. i tried on the size 0 and 2 and though they both fit, the size 2 was more flattering (i'm 5' 8"" 120lbs). compared to cartonnier's capris (which i love and wear a size 4 in), the fabric and construction on these is superior. and the color is knockout red."
1, Perfect high rise jeans - just a little bit of stretch for comfort. the high waist doesn't roll down and no knicker cleavage when bending over. perfect to go with crop tops
1,"Feminine beauty Love this top, the lace detailing on it is gorgeous and fits tts. however, the length does run a bit short, not crop top short, but it is shorter than i expected, and i'm s short person.the color is listed as white and as pictured, it also looks white, but it's not. it's definitely an ivory color. i bought a white camisole to wear under it and when the top arrived, the tank didn't match the top."
1,"Adorable dress The picture says it all. fits tts. love it, love it, love it!"
1,"Deceptively true to size and flattering I got this dress for my younger sister who's in the process of losing weight. she's currently wearing a size 12 with comfort room but can occasionally squeeze into smaller sizes depending on the product. this dress is deceptively true to size. at first glance it looks like a roomy dress but the inner part of the dress zips up real tight. as a result, the boxy top part of the dress doesn't look too big and is in fact very flattering. the dress is very silky and looks as high quality as its price."
1,Cute and flattering Love these pants. the color is a true red and they are very flattering on. i ordered the 6 but they are a little big and i think the pant will give a little when wearing. just reordered the size 4.
1,Fabulous and delicate The perfect summer top. paired with a small tank underneath and jeans and had many compliments!
1,"Perfection I loved this top . it is exactly what i wanted,"
1,"Beautiful top! Love this top! the lace pattern is gorgeous, and the detail at the neck and sleeves make it a little more casual. it's completely sheer, so you do need a white tank or shell underneath. the top is on the shorter side, but definitely not a crop. i'm 34c and 140b and got a small. fits great and pairs well with black pants and heeled booties."
1,Casual and cute! Fits perfect!! tank top or bath top. swings nicely and not too tight on top. i ordered large and am a 38 d. sits perfect not long not short!
1,"Vivid print, easy fit This will be a frequently worn item. print is beautiful and the fit is comfy and classy."
1,"Okay This top is a little more casual than i anticipated especially for the price. it is completely sheer and you do need a tank under it. also, the arm and neck makes it look more like a ordinary teeshirt. still, the lace design is super cute and would work well with both skirts and jeans."
1,"Lovely top; size down I'm an xl in retailer tops, and to be frank sometimes some of the xl are too fitted and i return them. i bought this blouse in size large and it fits loose everywhere. it drapes very nicely in the front and back, and the arms fit loose. i'm making a point to say this to let people know to size down. 
-
i was concerned this blouse might be too short because it looks very short on the model, but for me it hits at a nice length; i have a short waist and am busty. the lace doesn't hit my neck"
1,Royal albert style This dress attracted my attention with its victorian inspired print. the details are to die for. the blue is not the same as the picture. slightly darker and more muted.
1," I really love this dress but i am still struggling with keeping it or not. i have an hour glass figure with a somewhat fullish behind :). it is tight around that area which i think it is meant to be but i am not sure how comfortable i am with that. i wasn't sure about the belt but it really works. i am 5""3 and weigh 118. i did have to size up from 2p to 4 p for it not to feel too tight in all areas."
1,"Love love love I tried this top on in the store and didn't buy it because i was in a hurry. obsessed about it and it was sold out when i went back. so happy i was able to get it online, it's beautiful. i got a medium and it fits perfectly, enough room that it hangs nicely but not baggy, i'm typically a medium in shirts at retailer. it looks beautiful with high waisted black pants. i wear a cami underneath. i own it in white and tried it on with a black bra only and it looked great, i just didn't feel comfortable"
1,"The best. I can't say enough good things about this sweater. i bought it when it was full-price and it was totally worth it. it is incredibly soft and looks very sophisticated. i wish i could live in this sweater--given the color and my propensity to make a mess, i want to buy two more just in case!"
1,Perfect for summer It's a great addition for summer. defiantly need a tank on under it but very pretty.
1,"Love love love how long this sweater is I was already purchasing another mock neck in a similar color when i came upon this sweater. it is everything a snuggly sweater should be. it is long in the torso with long sleeves that really do cover your hands, like in the picture online. if you like that sort of thing, this is a great sweater. the sweater even has pockets, which may be a little odd, but on this sweater it works. i bought this to wear with a pair of sanctuary flowered leggings. it is the perfect outfit!"
1,"Beautiful!! Love this top and will be wearing it for our fall family pics this weekend! it is lovely, soft and flattering."
1,"Scrumptious, cozy, beautiful sweater I purchased this on sale. it exceeded my expectations. it is extremely soft and had a very unique construction and details. i love it. it does shed a bit, but that does not bother me as the sweater is stunning! ordered my typical size small. no camisole is needed if worn with a nude bra."
0, I love the pattern of this shirt but there is definitely a design flaw in the arm/armpits.
1,"Soft and cozy Soft and cozy, not itchy at all, and it has pockets! i am 5'3, 120lbs, 34dd bra and take this in size small."
1,"Cute but pills Straight out of the mail, this cozy soft adorable charming sweater was *full* of little pills. i love the embroidery, the swingy slightly oversized fit that doesn't overwhelm and the high snuggle factor. wish this came in other colors and was knitted with a less fussy yarn."
1,"Stylish, but sheds This sweater is beautiful and stylish, but unfortunately it sheds a bit. considering the sale price, it's still worth it so i won't return it."
1,"Beautiful! I love this dress.....but, and it saddened me that there was a but; the material would wrinkle near the sleeves (fit issue) and the high neckline was a little uncomfortable. i ended up returning it, because at this price point, i need perfection. i would definitely recommend this dress, it just wasn't for me."
1,"Soft lace The lace on this looks like it would be stiff, but it isn't. it's soft and drapes nicely. i normally buy an xl (if it's not a knit) and so i did. the top will fit up to a size 18 in the xl because it is boxy and generous. it fit me perfectly and just tapered my body. it looks looser in the photo.

it's as see through as the photo. and, i wouldn't wear a cami under it. that defeats the purpose for hot weather imho. i think a nude bra works just fine. you can see the model is wearing a white bra"
1,"Soft, cozy and stylish! Absolutely love this sweater because it is so pretty while being soft and comfortable. i am 5'4"" and purchased the small?it falls a little below my hips. while the color matches everything, the pockets and details add a nice touch and the longer sleeves are cozy. the only drawback is it pills and sheds."
1,Great buy! Really great tank. fit runs a little small if you are tall.
1," I wore this dress for an after party the day of my wedding day in new orleans. going to a music lounge!! seriously, i kept getting compliments!!! it's fits beautiful and i just love the different type of patterns!"
0,"Do not wash! This simple lace top is beautiful and easy to wear, but do not wash it. the hem completely fell apart for me!"
1,"Excellent dress I usually try to buy things on sale but after trying this dress on twice, i didn't want to run the risk of waiting and it selling out. it is extremely flattering and i think it will be very versatile - i'll definitely wear this dress to work, out with friends, and you could also wear it to bridal/baby shower events as well. i bought the dress in blue and it is extremely comfortable. i do think it runs large - i am 5'9, 145lbs with a very straight (no hips) / athletic build (have an athlete butt)"
1,"Elegant This dress is absolutely stunning. i did agree with other reviewers that the skirt is very full. i had it taken in, and it fits exactly like the model."
1,"Such a great dress! I love this dress - the fabric is super soft, and it falls beautifully! wish it was lined, but it's a keeper. it does run big - i'm always a solid medium, and i had to go down to a small for this one (but who's complaining!). the burgundy color is gorgeous! i'm 5'4 150 lbs, a size 8 (m) almost always."
1, Lovely dress. i did send it back only because the length was below my knee and i prefer slightly above the knee.
1, This has quickly become my favorite dress. i bought the turquoise dress and the color is so lovely. the fit is perfect and the lines are flattering and classic. this is one of those dresses that will never go out of style.
0,"Not great for those with a little extra... I love everything by cloth & stone so was excited to see that they made a dress. hooray! i ordered it in the xl, which is my usual size in their shirts. when i tried it on i was so sad to see that it barely fit around my tummy and hips! i am a true size 12/14 and the xl just barely gave me enough room to move. my chest also caused the dreaded ""button gape."" it is clear that they cut the dress for people with a stick straight figure. so disappointing!!"
1,"Decadent and delightful* Dress is beautiful in person, light material that is excellent for summer.

this dress is not forgiving in the chest, so ladies if you bigger chested i suggest going up a size or two. i'm 5'4, 145 lbs and 34ddd, i usually wear 8 or 10, this dress in a 10 made my look like i was wearing an unflattering sports bra."
1, I love this dress! wasn't much on the hanger but fell in love as soon as i put it on. almost returned after reading the reviews about the fabric content and printed design instead of embroidered but tried it on one last time and decided to keep it. the silhouette is just stunning. absolutely stunning. this will be a classic piece in my wardrobe that i pass down to my children one day.
1,Beautiful details I love everything about this dress. the sleeve and bodice detail make this dress exceptional. the fit is true to size. i ordered medium. the length is as it appears on the model- just below the knee. the material is of great quality and the slip lining is made of a nice stretchy knit.
1," I love this dress! very comfortable fit, and lots of compliments for the color (moss). took me from the classroom to a cocktail party. one of my best retailer purchases."
1,"Beautiful beaded basic This is a beautiful, flattering top that looks great on its own or layered under kimonos or jackets. i bought it in wine and black."
1,"Like it, don't love it I love this dress in the photos, and like it enough to keep it--but i don't love it. it runs borderline true-to-size/slightly large. i'm 5'8"", 133 lbs, 34 b and usually wear a 6 in dresses. i ordered a sm and med. am keeping the sm. medium was way too big. my main issue is the amount of fabric in the skirt--it's a bit full. in the pics, this dress appears straight, but it's not. the higher waist and skirt's fullness gives it a more casual, youthful look, which is not what i want. but the quality"
1,"Its a keeper I am 5'2"", 120lbs. and bought the 4 petite, which is what i normally wear, and it fits perfectly. the quality of the fabric and stitching is good, not great, and more what i would expect to see in a less expensive garment, but for me, the style, the fit and the fact that it doesn't seem to show wrinkles, at least not before washing, turned it in to a keeper for me. the drawstring ties in the back and i find it a little weird when you wear a belt with it. i tried the ada belt with it, but found i"
1,"Nice enough Too bad the blue one is sold out in my size (petite), i ordered the 00p, based on feedback at m store that it runs big, that was a good choice (i am 5'1.5"", 115 lbs#. 

the material teds to wrinkle though, so will have to think about keeping it.

cut is flattering, i like it with the belt like the picture on the model, but was nice too with the drawstring and a nice chunky necklace #bought black dress, so gold necklace is nice).

length was mid calf, but because it has a rounded hem, it wa"
1,"Black vs ivory - help! I waited to review as i ordered both colors and multiple sizes for comparison.

ivory is actually truly longer than the black, i wasn't sure from the photos on line, but having tried both on, ivory is longer (as shown online).

true to size/bigger: i am never sure if i should write true to size or big, but went with the xs petite (used to do everything in xs)... at 115 lbs, 30 dd chest, 26.5 in waist,t ehre was room to move super comfortably. petite for sure for me for both length at the kne"
1,"Not worth the price This pajama-like dress is not worth $150 (full price plus tax in texas), so i can't really justify keeping it. i kept having to pull it over on one side so it would align correctly. it also runs big. i bought the m (which i am returning) and it bunches at the waist but the length was perfect. the s is too short on the bottom. i love the color, but it's going back. i'd buy it if it were on sale."
1,"So adorable! This top is so unbelievably cute! the fit is perfect and it goes with just about anything on the bottom. i personally styled mine with high waisted distressed skinny jeans and it looks adorable. its a tiny bit see-thru, so you do need to wear a tank under it."
1,Comfy work dress Love the warm color and soft fabric - paired with chic tights and ankle boots and it fits right into a more casual workplace.
1,"Love the beading details. This romantic top has lovely embroidery and beading details. i purchased this in purple, which is actually more of a cranberry color. i like that the detail work carries over to the back on the cap sleeves."
1,"Love this cozy dress! This dress not only makes a statement, it is very comfortable and versatile. casual or dressy options! price is reasonable and i am anxious to wear it for the first time. true to size and has some give. i ordered xs. love it!"
1,"Wonderful and easy dress I bought this dress in gray in a size 4. i am usually a size 6, even an 8 in maeve, so i said this dress runs a tad large. it is soft and easy to wear--throw it on and go. i think it looks best with a belt but that's my opinion. i am 5' 8.5"" tall, and this is a midi length on me. plenty long. not sure how it will wash. i think a fabric steamer will be needed. all in all, very pleased."
0,"Sloppy fit Tried this dress in a small. i am 5'6"", 135lbs, 34c. the small was huge - the sash helped some, but looked like a potato sack on me. also, i noticed the fabric was piling slighly in the store. i had high hopes for this dress but left this one in the store."
1," Tried the blue motif, size 6, regular.
i'm 5'6"" and if i were shorter i'd go with petite sizing.
stats: 34a-28-36 with broad shoulders, sometimes i go up to a size 8 in blazers but this was a perfect fit. side pockets, dress is unlined and quite lightweight. the tie has to be tied in back and i liked the clean lines this gives in front. nice and simple for when it warms up!"
1, Beautiful and versatile dress but shoddy quality. i hand washed (per the instructions) it after wearing it once  and the sleeves are already falling apart.
1,"Love everything about it! I bought this dress in the print and the moss color and may very well return for the dark gray. for reference, i am 5'2"", 140 lbs. i have been more recently wearing size 6, but a 4 was perfect, so i do think it runs a bit large. this dress has a drawstring that ties in the back and cinches the waist up nicely, and is very flattering. the waist actually hits at the natural waistline and not up on the ribs. the fabric is lightweight and washes well. i washed and immediately hung dry. it was slight"
1,"Flattering basic I'm trying to buy more basic, versatile clothes and this dress in gray is great for that. definitely runs large-- i usually wear an 8 and it fits in a 6p. i'm, 5'5"" and the petite falls where it does on the model. the regular was unflatteringly long and sack-like. quality seems ok for the sale price."
0,"So close, but the cut is not good! I have these shirts in the blue and green and they were great. i'm 5'4"" c chest and athletic build - the small shirts fit pretty good and i love the fabric so i kept them. i really wanted these dresses to work but the cut was different even between the gray and burgundy. there was tons of room in the chest, but it was tight in the shoulders. i really wanted to love this, but there's just too many cut issues. it is a good length for work though."
1,"Perfect fit! This dress is super soft, beautiful on, perfect fit!"
1,"Super long sleeves This is a cute top but the sleeves are super long.  they swallowed up my entire hand when i put my arms down to the side.  i also found it to run slightly large.  i ordered my usual medium and i had too much room under the armpits.  the sleeves weren't as fitted as the model shot either, which i would of preferred.  i probably could of shortened the sleeves, but didn't think this style top fit me so i sent it back.  this does not require a cami underneath."
1,"Drawstring midi dress I was in the store today and saw this dress in blue and had to try it on. i usually wear a size 10 in tops to accommodate my large chest, but the size 8 fit great with even a little room to spare. they didn't have the petite 8, so i ended up with the regular size, which falls an inch or so above my ankles. i am 5'2, so the petite may fit better as a midi dress, however, i really love the length. the fabric is soft and airy. can't wait to wear this once the weather is warmer."
1,"Love it! This shirt is just as great in person as it is online.  it's a substantial fabric which is not see-through which seems hard to find these days with whitish tops.  the color is more off-white without looking yellow.  i ordered a small and medium because i was concerned about the length and tightness in sleeves.  they fit almost the same with the only difference being that the upper sleeves on the small were just a tad bit more fitted, but not in a bad way.  i'm 5'5"" and found the length to be jus"
1, Great staple item. i have it in multiple colors and like them all. easy to add statement necklace to change up the look. wear it under cardi or jacket to make it not look 'tent' like.
1,"Just what i was looking for. I ordered both the petite and regular in the olive green motif. the regular fit more as i was hoping so i returned the petite.
i am only 5' 4"" but my legs are long for my height. i wasn't ready to have the side slits ""up to here"" and whereas they are not they are still quite high it is modest enough to be worn any place i might wear the dress. i think i will likely wear a belt with it as shown at least part of the time. i just bought some print fabric sling back shoes which go beautifully with"
0,"Save your money This dress would have been gorgeous and consistent with retailer's aesthetic if the designs had been embroidered onto a thick silk/jacquard fabric to give it texture, which is how it looks from the photo. obviously it would have been more expensive, but in any case, this was just a really expensive polyester dress, which it says in the product description, but i gave retailer the benefit of the doubt, thinking if anyone can make even polyester look like a quality product, it'll be retailer. but now i"
0,"Too large I ordered this dress in small, my usual size (for reference: 5'7"", 125 lb). it is too wide. it looks more fitted in the pictures and hangs loose on me. the belt does not help much; it still looks like a sack and i feel like a girl wearing her mom's dress.

also, i found that the material crumples easily."
1," Love this dress! it fits perfectly, is flattering, and the fabric is high quality. i ordered the blue print, and it is a vibrant turquoise. i may order in the charcoal as well, as this is a comfortable, cute dress for everyday casual. i am 5'7, 135 lbs and the size 4 was perfect, even a tad bit loose, but i prefer a bit loose to tight, especially with the design with the buttons up the front."
1,"Simple classic I bought the burgundy color in this shirt dress. usually wear a size 4 and xs in most brands. purchased the xs in this dress. i'm 5'4, 118#, 34d. the fabric is rayon however it feels more like a light flannel or soft brushed cotton. like you've worn it forever. the length says 40"" long but i found when worn with the belt it rides up substantially. about 2-3 inches above the knee. felt like i was squirming to pull it down. i normally wouldn't be drawn to something so simple but when i walked out"
1,"Beautiful color, beautiful fabric Bought this back during an retailer event, because i was in the market something long & oversized to wear over leggings. so when i saw this, i thought it could fit the bill. i read the reviews & knew it was more of a soft, t-shirt-like fabric and is short when belted, so, because i'm 5'10, i was sold!
i bought the xl, because i have wide shoulders & a dd chest size. 

when i got it home -- i was in love: rich garnet & so soft & comfy. then i tried buttoning it. it was just a bit too small & pul"
1,"Soft like pj's, professional enough for work! I purchased the grey color, and i love love love everything about this dress. the fabric is so soft and feels like pj's. i'm just shy of 5'9"" and the length is perfect for work. i purchased the medium, the fit was perfect for me (size 8, 138 lb).

highly recommended!!"
1, This dress is very lovely - ivory fits as pictured (slightly below knee) in ivory not as the black is depicted (much shorter). fits a little larger than expected and material is very stretchy.
1,"Charming Lots of embellishment, striking magenta color, feels great on, with a flattering neckline that isn't too low. i recommend it!"
1,"Beautiful shirt dress This dress is much better irl than pictured. when i saw it online i thought it looked very frumpy, but i tried it on in store and loved it. it's a perfectly draped shirt dress, and it ties to define the waist. a classic!"
1,"Cute dress! This is a very cute dress! the sweater material is not itchy at all. i love the bell sleeve and how the seam at the top of the bell matches up to the waistline of the dress. good quality and well made. i am 5' 9"" tall and this dress falls just above my knees. so for me, it's the perfect length. i bought the black dress and i look forward to wearing it throughout the fall and winter."
1," I wasn't sure about this dress, and decided to give it a shot based on reviews, could not be happier. before trying it on i was worried about the length, and always worry about dreaded button gap at the chest, but none of that is an issue."
1,"Great pirchase I was nervous about this purchase, but it turned out to be a new favorite. the blue color is stunning on and i can easily see this taking me from work to dinner. i am normally a size 2 or 4 in dresses. after reading reviews about how this dress runs large, i ordered a 2 and hoped i didn't have to return it. the 2 is perfect and roomy. the drawstring can be let out or in for more figure definition. this really is a beautiful and modest dress."
1,"Elegant Material is nice, great for a party or date night. fits true to size, (l for me, i'm a 12). would recommend. the bell sleeve is right on trend and very tasteful."
0,"Wanted to like it,but it just didn't work.boring! I ordered this on-line, in a size 8. the fit is ample and fine fine, and the fabric is acceptable, but as much as i wanted to like it, and keep it, i ultimately returned it. it is just too, too conservative for me. i loved the deep olive/khaki colour, and even experimented wearing it open as a duster over a top and slip pants, leggings, or skinny jeans, but the collar and the front pocket styling are just too man-tailored and cargo-like in their styling for me. i tried it with different belts, w"
1,"Soft and easy Fits well, soft and comfortable"
0,"Not worth it. While i love the fabric and the pattern, this skirt leaves too much to be desired. the full price is absurd considering what you get.
there is no mention online that there is no built in slip, and as the material is extremely thin a slip is an absolute must. (see attached photo.) even in dim lighting you can see straight through. 
also for this price point it is strange that the skirt is 'pull-on styling.' i would say that it is true to size, and i am usually a medium @ retailer, but i have a sm"
0,"Frumpy I was hoping to wear this dress on my wedding day before the ceremony. i'm 5'5"", 130 pounds, usually wear a 6. i ordered this dress in medium and it hangs off of me. it is not straight as it looks on the model, but bells out from the waist. the sleeves are so long that they covered my fingers."
1,"Cute top - metallic threads are itchy I ordered the purple and black first. loved both colors, but they ran large and after i tried on the purple i realized the metallic threads in the shoulder area were irritatingly itchy. for reference, i'm currently 165 and 5' 11"" with broader shoulders. returned the larges and just bought the medium purple on sale. waiting for its arrival to see if the threads will bother me after a bit. beautiful, saturated purple color, btw! very true to the image - not cranberry as one reviewer thought."
0," I loved how soft this dress was, as well as versatile. however, i only got to wear it one time because after the first wash, a giant fabric tear happened on one of the seams. unfortunately, the fabric is so soft, but rather thin, and it didn't hold. the care instructions say machine washable but i wouldn't put it in the washing machine again. especially since i often have to wash clothes twice in the washer i use because it's so old and barely agitates. would love this if it was made a little be"
1,"Love! I love this top! looks great with just about any kind of jean (skinny, flare, especially high waisted). even looks good with vests and cardigans. a perfect versatile piece for the fall - you won't regret!"
1,Awesome purple color This is a cute swing top. tts but generous. best thing about it- the color. i got purple and it is so pretty and saturated. i think it'll look great with big gold hoop earrings. alone or under a cardigan or denim jacket. i'd consider other colors at sale price.
1,"Classic! I was pleasantly surprised with this one. fits a bit large. i'm 8-10, the 8 fits just right. the moss is a great staple color."
1,"Lovely style, fabric and drape I loved the style when i saw it online and even more in person. the fabric is light but not too light. it has a nice drape i didn't expect. easy to wear and style. the draw string gives it a great shape but a belt is a great addition for more interest. the length is fantastic as well. wonderful midi length but with the side slits."
1,Don't pass by Comfortable. flattering. i agree with other reviewers that this is great piece. i purchased the red one and it is beautiful. fits tts.
1,"Great skirt with extra stretch! One of the reasons i avoid skirts at all costs is because i have a bigger tummy and don't like the extra tight feeling i have of a skirt around my waist. i like this skirt because of its stretchiness. even wore it to a bbq where i could eat my heart out and not feel constricted at all.

received many compliments including: ""you look like you're vacating in the caribbean!"""
1,"Great summer jeans! These jeans fit true to size, and they look amazing. i wear a 26 and have an athletic build, and they look great everywhere! i love how they look with sandals."
1,"Loved it but the fabric didn't keep its shape Oh how i wanted this skirt to work.... the fabric - both pattern and color - is beautiful. the style is very nice. the knit is comfortable. but... the knit was so soft and pliable that it lost its shape right away. after wearing it for an hour, the front slit was curling in weird directions. the fabric around the hips got sort of crooked and hang-y. i would have loved the fabric to be one notch more substantial for a more defined waist and better integrity around the hips."
1,"Flared helps the crop I find that petite gals with short (,muscular) legs can have a hard time finding cropped pants that fit right. the flare on these makes the pants oh so flattering. the material is nice and thick and holds you in. the colors and patterns are beautiful fall colors, quite lovely and subtle, there is a nice stretch to the pant, the waist has nice closures, can't wait to weer these! i ordered the 0p and htey fit perfectly. (115 lbs, 26.5 in wiast)"
1,"Fantastic maxi skirt! This is my first maxi skirt and i am pleasantly surprised! i might not have purchased this had i not tried it on in store, but did for the fun of it and loved the shape and swing of the skirt. the material is a comfortable and substantial stretchy jersey fabric with an inner lining that keeps it from being sheer. though it is kind of a dark navy, i would agree with one of the previous reviewers that it could pass for a black and white pattern. for my sister's graduation, i paired it with a white"
0,"Better on the hanger I wanted to love this product so badly. i ordered it in the mail, and it looked beautiful coming out of the box. i normally look really nice in grey, but this color really washed me out and was not nice on. the fabric is very sheer, so you would have to wear it over a camisole/tank top. this is one of those pieces that looks better on the hanger than in person. large in arms, small on body. odd fit."
1,"Perfect fit! This skirt has a great pattern and the stretchy fabric allows it to shape my body perfectly. adorable with a white-t, or a black one...great for a night out on the town and some sexy, strappy sandals! love this skirt!"
1,"Great skirt, great fit! I love this skirt. i normally wear a medium or large, depending on cut, and i bought this in a medium. very stretchy and forgiving! it's lined so it feels substantial but not too heavy. it's flattering!"
1,"Cute and comfy I think i own nearly every maeve skirt retailer has sold over the last five years, and this might be my new favorite. one major improvement over years past is the fit...it really is true to size, rather than running large as has been the case in the past. the material is a substantial, stretchy jersey with a nice texture. the weight of the fabric combined with the jersey slip means it's not sheer at all, and it also a nice smooth fit, skimming over less-than-perfect areas. i also really appreciate"
1,"Love! Love love love this dress! but, if you are not wearing a slip...you should be! please wear a slip, you can see right through this dress."
1,"So fun! I tried on this romper when it was still full price and loved it, but wasn't sure i wanted to splurge at the time. at the new sale price this romper is definitely worth it for the quality and style. i am 5'2''/103lbs and the xs fits pretty well, but truthfully an xxs would have been better if it existed. the top part of the romper (above the waist) is a bit long--- the waistband hits maybe an inch or 2 below my natural waist, but perhaps this can be tailored. overall very happy with this purchas"
1,"High quality skirt, great price! I couldn't be happier with this skirt! i was expecting a jersey-type material, but was pleasantly surprised by the thicker, textured, higher quality material. the ruffle on the front is such a cute feature. this skirt moves and flows very nicely when walking. it is lined and has an elastic waistband, it's super comfortable. so far i've paired it with a bright red knotted tee and a sheer white sleeveless button-down. i receive compliments every time i wear it! i'm 5'2"", 110 lbs, i ordered an xs a"
1,"Coolest skirt i've seen in a while I haven?t loved the look of something so much in a while as this skirt in the green motif, which i spotted in my durham store. so i ordered it in the xspetite; my usual retailer size (+/- 105 lbs., 34"" hips, 26"" waist, average torso length, short legs). if you have smaller than a 26-inch waist, the waist of the xsp will probably be too big. i?d say this skirt is exactly as pictured. the fabric is a thickish, textured knit on the outside, with a thin, green, very soft jersey lining. you have to be"
1," Me: 5'6"", 130, waist 28/29, hips 36. bought the size 4. i'm expecting a bit of stretch to allow a bit more room for the booty...3% spandex and they seem like standard cartonnier 'charlie' fit.
i love the kicky cropped flare.
they're described as grey motif but everyone in store (and i agree) called them green. the main diamonds are forest green with a grey/green inset and a blue/grey inset inside that. (whew!)
they come with an extra button, keep it as those tiny buttons are going to be first"
1,"Great pants Love the color pattern, tiny gold buttons, flattering fit, quality of fabric and make.  i got size 4 petite, which fits perfectly. my husband said they looked really good on me and were keepers! i'm 5'2"", 115#.  highly recommend ."
1,Love this skirt This skirt fits amazing. i run between a s and m in bottoms and went with the s. there is a little give in the fabric which is always a plus. this will surely become a staple in my wardrobe.
1, I am in love with this skirt! it is the most flattering thing i have purchased in a while. the fabric is a beautiful medium weight knit with a good amount of give. it hugs your curves but doesn't cut in anywhere! i was able to easily go down a size from my usual. i love it so much that i am going to order the other color as well!
1,"Wonderful pants I walked into a local retailer store and saw these pants. talk about love at first sight. they have an amazing look and fit! usually, i have to buy petite-sized pants, but the length fit at my ankle, and i like the look better than what is shown. since it is still summer, i paired the pants with a cute white tank and black flip flops, but can't wait to mix it up with a cute bootie and sweater."
1,"Beautiful skirt! I absolutely love the way this skirt looks and fits. i have a smaller waist and larger hips so it is hard to find a pencil skirt that fits, but this skirt fits great! the material has some stretch to it but is still thick and looks really nice. the colors are beautiful, i bought it in the ""red"" which is really just multi-colored. i want it in the green now, too!"
1,"This is a lovely top when sized correctly. I am a small, athletic build and typically wear an xsmall in tops. naturally, in something with a more straight fit and blousy shape, an xsmall would be appropriate. i ordered it and was super bummed. the lace detail made the collar lay funny and the shoulders were too tight. i liked the sheer fabric though and the lace details and decided to order a size up. i am so glad i did because everything laid like it was supposed to. this top is beautiful with a sexy, but refined look. i plan to dress i"
1,Tons of compliments I wore this skirt immediately when my delivery arrived. nothing but compliments. i went right back to order the green and it has sold out. bummer - i would buy every. single. color. this skirt is that great!
1," This skirt fits like a glove. i'm 5'6, curvy and it is very flattering on my shape. its a good length and the material has some stretch in it so it's very comfortable."
1,"Love maeve skirts! Again, maeve knocks it out of the park with this skirt! great quality, style and comfort! i love that it's machine washable. so great and versatile for work or a night out! this is not a ""con"" but might be a bit long for short ladies. i'm 5'6"" and it's below the knee."
0,"Chameleon color Saying that these pants are comfortable would be redundant. they are over & above in comfort. i wear a size 8; and they are right on in sizing. i want to comment on the color/print. to see the green, i had to take the pants by a window with natural light and look closely. that being said, i think the pants take on the color of top one chooses. i walked through my closet with the pants in hand. they match with light grey, periwinkle blue, light sky blue, navy, white, your choice. i do prefer a so"
1,"Love the design and fit My only problem with the skirt was the length - it appears shorter in the pictures, and i can't take it up since it would mess up the front slit. i would have returned for the petite, but it was not available in the green color which i loved. even though the length is longer than i usually wear, i get non-stop compliments on the skirt. and, it's very versatile."
1,"Va va voom! Great skirt! i bought the red and paired it with a casual white button down. i feel like the top definitely needs to be short or tucked in for the look to work. i am typically a 2 in bottoms, and went with the small in this. the xs probably fits more like it's intended to, but it is very curve-hugging, and i was more comfortable with the looser fit of the small (especially since i am tucking in a blouse). there is stretch in the skirt, and the fabric has a nice feel."
1,"Standout pants Amazing pants! i saw them at my local retailer and knew they would be great addition to my wardrobe (in-person is even better than photo!). they are flattering and i love that the pattern lends itself to many options...could be an ivory sweater or blouse or perhaps a mustard jacket...so much fun! i am 135 lbs, 5'7"" and went with the 6."
1, Love this beautiful sweater! it's become one of my wardrobe staples. it's got a great cut and i love the design.
1,"Flattering I bought the skirt in the green color and it is beautiful. this skirt is curve hugging, but in a sexy way. very comfortable as well."
1,"Amazing pair of jeans!! These are the softest jeans ever! i love the way that they hold their shape, and make my bum look amazing!! i am 5'3"" and they do come much longer than shown on the model...right below my ankle bone. i actually prefer this because they will be wearable right through fall if i pair them with booties! the fit is true to size...108 pounds and i got a 25. highly recommend!!"
1,"Love but runs big! I ordered this online in a m and l because i am usually one of those on the bottom - i will be returning both for a s. the fabric is great and a cool pattern, but it runs large by far. in addition to the large sizing the fabric has a decent stretch so that makes it even larger. i think the small will fit well and the cut is flattering - i am about 5'11'' and it hits below my knees, similar to the model in the picture, so i would definitely get this in petite if youre on the shorter side. it's al"
1,Lovely skirt! Love this skirt! i have worn it to work with a simple black shirt for a great outfit! i have had many compliments on it. it is very flattering and comfortable!
1,"Figure flattering This skirt is figure flattering and stylish, while still being work appropriate. i like the length as well."
1,"Lovely Really beautiful skirt. unique print (red) and stylish. keep in mind this is knit, stretchy, form fitting. as mentioned the skirt is very comfortable and a heavier texture fabric. i purchased a large (i am 5'7 and 154lbs) and don't like skirts too tight so i sized up. the large is fine however, i noticed at the bottom of the skirt it doesn't quite fit as slim as i would like. i suspect the m would be better. if you have a stomach it will show! i also noticed that the skirt seemed much longer on"
1,"Perfect pencil I ordered this skirt in both colors and they are just to die for. the fun fabrics make it a playful and trendy take on a timeless essential, and the fit is incredibly flattering. an added bonus: the fabric has give so it's also extremely comfortable. i hope they come out with more color options!"
0,"What went wrong? I am sorry to say this blouse is way below all retailer standards. this top should have been placed on sale a long time ago! poor quality in cut, fabric, design. this is a top one would grab at a local box store for 19.99. the colors are not as vibrant. the shoulders ill fitted. and the fabric and threads are very cheap. i was expecting so much more.sorry retailer.....my favorite store to shop!"
1,"So comfy! great for pajamas or super casual I love these! they are cute enough to wear out, and they are really comfortable. i ordered a small and at 5'3"" they are a little long but they shrunk in the wash and they're still totally wearable"
1," I disagree with the most recent review! they are legging style fit but not leggings at all! they are a jean style with a patterning on them a texture.
great colors!"
1,Flowy & feminine Beautiful and flowy blouse . bottom is very full so i recommend sizing down - 1 size. very feminine and i really like the colors and pattern. i am a 36c on top and found top flattering with pilcro serif legging like jeans and booties.
1,"Great shirt I saw this shirt online, loved it, but unfortunately it was sold out in the regular size small. however, retailer shirts tend to be long on me, so i ordered a petite small. it fits great! i am actually happy i got a petite because i feel a regular would have been too long. the shirt comes to my hips. for reference i'm 5'8"" 145 lbs. and my measurements are 34-27-38."
1,"Love!! Comfy, cozy, and great bargain for the sale price."
1," Beautiful top but disappointed that the top was so sheer. i'm 5""2, 120 and i ordered my usual xs. fit perfectly but may exchange for a s as i was hoping for it to be a little longer (hits right below my waist)."
1,"Love the cut and lace strip on the back. I purchased this shirt and was hoping to be able to wear it without a tank underneath (because of the lace detailing on the back). however, this shirt is a bit see-through, so i still had to wear a tank with it. it's very cute even with the tank though!"
0,"Meh? I bought these a great alternative to black jeans but they are headed back.  the texture is nice but let's call them what they are- thin, leggings.  not worth the price in my opinion.  honestly, i can't seem to find a pair of pilcros that i like so i'd spent the extra money on a better pair of black jeans."
1,"Gorgeous detailed tee! I ordered the coral, size small, it's a beautiful peach color and the linen is very soft. it is longer, and roomier in the waist than i was expecting, however, with skinny jeans it looks great. the detail makes this top very eye-catching, i'm very happy with my purchase!"
1,"Love it This shirt is so flattering. i bought it in the recent ""it"" color but i wish it came in some additional brighter hues. this shirt is just so lovely. it's long in length too!"
1," I am 5' 3 3/4"" tall, and usually wear medium in retailer tops. i love this top. purchased same style in sleeveless this past summer and was hoping the style would return, as i was complimented every single time i wore my summer version! i do wear a cami underneath. i agree that in the picture the yoke doesn't seem pink, however i like it even better with the more pink hue as it gives an even more eye catching piece the pizzaz i look forward to seeing in retailer offers! i love retailerpo"
1,"Trendy piece I love the flowy-beachy look of this jumpsuit, it is very comfortable, and super cute, my only ""gripe"" is that the hip part is pretty wide, hands in the pockets, you can't tell, but if i were to get this, i would want a xxs. length was ok not petite since it is a flowy look. colors are very nice too, kind of ""70's"", but i love it. i think i will get this if it goes to sale, even if it is a little big on me... i am 115 lbs, 30d chest and tried on xs."
1,Beautiful top I absolutely love this top! i own it in coral and white. it is simply beautiful and the linen fabric makes it comfortable and breathable. i am so happy i bought this top!
1,"Lovely top This is a beautiful, light-weight summer top. i ordered the white - perfect for summer. very feminine. true to size. i am 117 5'3 34b and the x-small fit perfectly."
0,"Comfy but see through I ordered these on sale despite a previous reviewer's comment that they were unflattering on the back side. they really do hug your bum, but that is not what bothers me. what bothers me is that the back side is totally see through, so unless you plan on wearing them with a long top, they are not wearable in public or around other people. i have gotten some of my favorite pieces from retailer, but also some of the most poorly designed. unfortunately, these fall in the latter category."
1,"Beautiful top! I have to disagree with earlier reviewers who suggested this top isn't flattering for larger-breasted women. i'm breastfeeding, so i currently have dds that are the bane of my existence, and i was very happy with the way this top fit across my chest. i didn't give it a full 5 stars for aesthetic/design only because i wish it were a bit longer. it hit me below my waist, but not below the crotch of my jeans where it hits the model (possibly because she is not burdened by swollen breasts). the shir"
1,Great poncho! This poncho is so comfortable. fabric soft and not too hot. this goes with so many things. my favorite purchase this fall!
1,"I love this! This poncho is my new favorite thing. the material is soft and it is long enough in the back to cover your butt which i also love so that i can wear leggings underneath. i normally wear a size m top, but bought the xs/s poncho otherwise it was just too big. the only negative is that you have to hand wash :("
1,"Perfect poncho I have been waiting for this poncho to hit my local retailer.  it was as good as it looks online. the perfect piece to put on over a tank or t-shirt. you can dress it up or down and i love that it has pockets. i wear a 10 and i bought the m/l, this is meant to be oversized so buy appropriately."
1,"Unique Found this jumpsuit in standard size small/red motif (pictures don't do it justice) in-store and to my surprise, it actually fit! of course, it was billowy since i'm short/ 113lbs., and it came all the way down to the bottom of my ankles where they meet my feet, which i don't mind. i love that it almost looks like a maxi dress when on. the smocked bodice was snug for a size small so there is a little bit of skin bubbling out in the chest area/near my armpits..like normal women usually have. ladi"
1,"Gorgeous colors, beautiful design I loved the fit and design so much that i splurged and purchased all three! the lavender has a blue tinge to it that makes it really unique. the coral is a little on the neon side but i love that and it's a great color for summer. i'm waiting for the white to arrive and hope it's actually white and not ivory, as retailer colors are sometime a little off. i'm petite and order the xxsp which fits like a dream. not too tight or loose, super comfortable and flattering. easy to pair with white, khaki,"

1,Perfect cotton jogger Quality assembled;comfortable and stylish with 2-tone fabric; wash w/o shrinkage;pair with every rainbow color. nice alternative to jean days.
1,"Great transitional item I love this - great coverage, goes with everything, flattering pockets, soft and soothing taupey gray palette - a+. retailer does it again."
1,Super cute & comfy My husband bought me these joggers for a retreat i went on. they are so comfortable and really cute. i am usually a size 4 and the size small fit great with some room.
1,"Fabulous!!!!! This could worn with anything. tank top, long sleeves, gloves, jeans and pants. very high quality material. will be a staple in my wardrobe this fall!!!"
1,"Great fit I have been searching around for new and unique clothes to wear to work. this top is cute, comfortable, and well made. these are all qualities that i look for when purchasing clothes. also the shirt is flattering for the stomach if you are like me and had a baby."
1,"Great dressy jean Super comfortable pant. they don't feel or look like jeans, but will hug your body like jeans. i bought the regular, size 26 - they waist is not tight and i needed to roll up the bottoms about 1.5 inches. i have not washed or dried these yet, but i imagine they will wash well."
1,"Love!!! I'll admit, it's been a few months since i've shopped at retailer. i feel like i have to try on just about everything because there doesn't seem to be much consistency between the brands. i'm so glad i wandered in our local store this week! this top is so beautiful in person and well-made. the embroidery is lovely and it's lined, so not too sheer. i'm tall and it was a good length, hitting just above the hip. i think it runs tts or maybe just a tad big. the s fit perfectly across the chest,"
0,"Cute in pic but... Like other reviewers have said, this is very sheer, look at the sleeve in the picture and you'll get an idea of how sheer the body is as well. the material posed challenges for it's creater because one top i tried on in the store had a sleeve that was smaller than the other, tight enough that it would have ripped if i weren't careful. tried on another identical top and the sleeves were a normal somewhat loose fit. bodice portion is much more intense pink in real life. loose, billowy, and perhaps"
1,Runs small Beautiful skirt but does run small. i wear a small and am able to keep the skirt but have to be very careful about under garments since it is so tight. looks great though.
1,"Great leggings not jeans! I'm giving these leggings 5 stars although i did return them. first off i do love pilcro jeans and leggings. beware these are not jeans at all. the tag says serif legging. these are excellent leggings if that's what you're looking for. i thought they were jeans and was willing to spend the money on them, but not for leggings. i'll consider buying if they go on sale."
1," I bought this in coral, it is soft and the fit is flattering. the perfect top for transitioning into fall here in the desert."
1,"So very pretty This is such a classy, elegant and interest piece for your wardrobe. the fabric and cut is lovely and it drapes really nice. i love how it doesn't slide around on your frame when you move and the pockets are awesome - such a fun and practical extra. i thought the arms were a little tricky - but you would see the same issue with any cape style top. the gray is a nice color, but i wish it came in another option - a wine color would be amazing."
0,"Pretty but not worth the price Pretty tee, but not worth the price.  lace is beautiful, but fit is blah."
0,"Dissapointed This is a beautiful top, however it looks better on the 80 pound model. the shirt sits awkward on your chest if you have any cleavage and there is way too much fabric around the body. if you are any size beyond a 2 then it just makes you look bigger than you are."
1,"Dreamy poncho! As soon as i saw this online i knew i'd love it, and when it arrived in my store i scooped it up right away!!! the poncho is exactly as it appears online. the color is different variations of gray. the fabric is soft and not itchy at all. it's longer in back, has arm holes on either side and lays beautifully. it's long enough to wear with leggings, but looks clean enough to pair with jeans and a top. this is light enough for cool summer nights, but will be my fall go to once the cold weather com"
1,"Yes yes yes! This is a gem. stretchy, graphic, easy to wear, lightweight and so fun! the best thing about this is it can be worn as a jumpsuit or as a higher waisted pant! i've seen it paired with a pilcro denim jacket and cute sandals, and then worn as pants with a black tank, jacket and silver belt. i love that this can be dressed up or down...you could even throw it on over your bathing suit as a coverup. i would go true to size on this one since there is some room and the top has great stretch."
1,Pretty and comfortable This is a very pretty top with a nice flow. i love the delicate pattern. it fits perfectly and is great for work or the weekend.
1,"Unexpectedly had to have it I love this top and despite the higher price point, it came home with me. normally i tend to go for very basic colors - white, black, gray. but i saw this and was intrigued by the high neck and subtle cut away sleeveless style. tried it on and it was love. the fit is great. it is flowey, but without the maternity look in front and all that extra fabric in the back. it's just right. i love the print and i am so not a print person. i tried it on with some taupe skinny jeans and a denim jacket. per"
1,Super comfortable and stylish I love the navy blue color. they are a fun alternative to skinny jeans. the fit is great and they are super comfortable!
1,"In love with these So many compliments and so comfortable--all i want from a pair of pants. i am 5'8+ and around 135 and a little bit of a pear, and these fit perfectly in size 28l. they felt a little tight at first and then stretched to be ideal. i bought black and really love the softness, the rise, and the way they go with everything. thinking of going back for one in the dark red. this will be a winter staple to dress up or down. 
i just hope they don't wear out too quickly!"
0,"Almost adorable...top button? This is as pretty in person as it is online, good quality (except one item i'll get to), and fits true to size. i'm 5'6"", normally a medium/8, and the medium fit great in this top.
i almost kept this shirt...so close, i had it on a hanger, but i kept trying it on. the shirt is well displayed in the pics online, but unless you get close it's hard to see that the top button is set a little wide. every time i put it on, my eyes went to the top button (i did get a second opinion and they agreed)..."
1,"Soooo comfy These are incredibly soft and comfortable. they are only for inside lounging, because they are a bit see through and have that long-johns type of material on it."
1,"So feminine This is so pretty! it was beautiful in white but i bought the blue because the fabric is a little bit see through. i'm 5' 4"" and weigh about 135 and this shirt fit just like on the model in the picture. it was a nice neat loose. not sloppy at all."
1," I've never owned a romper before but after trying it on at the store, i fell in love! i'm pear-shaped 5""4 at 185#. i got a med and it fits beautifully with just enough room to not be baggy. i got the red mitif. super flattering."
1,"Love this gorgeous jumpsuit! I purchased the one marked with the red dot (the one with the larger pattern and orange in it). i spied it in the store as soon as it arrived. i fell absolutely in love with it immediately. i am normally xl but this piece runs large so i tried the l and it's perfect. very bohemian, which i adore. first time out i folded over the top and wore it as pants and it looked fabulous with a black top. it can also be worn the way it is shown. i have also belted it and worn it with a black jacket, as show"
1,So comfy yet stylish I bought the top that goes with the pants & live that it's comfortable to wear at home yet looks good enough to to go anywhere. easy to care for. very happy with this!!
1,"Boys and arrows high-neck top I love boys and arrows, but this top is really best suited to smaller size chests because there's no adjustable ties or straps or reinforcements for support. also, the fabric is super soft, which is great for feel but not so much for fit if you require a little boost! for my 32d's i chose a different design."
1,Gorgeous This jumpsuit is absolutely fabulous. i normally don't wear jumpsuit but i like this one very much. it can be dresse down or dressied up. i really recommend this to everyone any shape who have. very relaxing and beautiful.
1,"A little thinner than expected I love the pilcro line and these leggings (yes definitely more a legging than jean) did not disappoint. however, i did think the material would have a little more substance and weight.  they are pricey, so i am hoping that the thinness of the material will not prevent them from holding up well."
0,"Comfy yet unattractive I have a love hate relationship with this product. it is comfortable and cozy, yet unshapely. after the initial wear, the product begins to stretch out, and if you sit for a while your knees are demarcated in the fabric once you stand. the sherpa front is soft, but the waffle material in the back is in no way flattering. i purchased for sleeping so it does that job nicely, but i would never leave the house with this on. i am hoping that after the first wash it shrinks a bit too. i am typically a"
1,"Nice top I bought this in white and coral. i usually wear xl, but both l and xl fit well. i bought coral in l and white in xl. it is a tad see-through but not a lot. the top is comfortable and looks very good on, coral is so dreamy and white perfect for a casual day out. i am not crazy about linen fabric though, it can be a bit scratchy, i would have preferred if the top were in a softer fabric. for now though i plan to keep both."
1,Love it This dress is exactly what i hoped it would be! super sexy and great material.
1, I really like the gentle flow of the fabric. this top can be worn casual or dressy by adding jewelry or or a scarf.
1,"Comfortable! This shirt is very comfortable. though it's casual, its uneven seams and asymmetry give it a little
more edge and character. fits true to size. i'm 5'5'', 125 lbs and was happy with the small."
1,"Flattering, beautiful autumn top I have this color also in the grey - flattering, interesting shirt. i have think hips but a fuller waist, the vertical lines of this shirt design suggest otherwise. great to pair with torn up skinny jeans! love the petite line now in portland."
1,"Good staple Cute shirt, nice for layering."
1,"Cute dress This dress is really cute and is a lightweight knit that is great for warmer days. the color is a lovely dusty rose that looks just like the picture. since it is a knit material and does tend to stretch out, i did go down one size so that it would be more form fitting. the length on the petite size is perfect for me."
1,"Love, love, love it! I saw this online and loved it. i wanted to wait for a sale and a promotion, but this tee-shirt sold out in the color holly. completely sold out but for petite. i bought a s and a m. the small works. it is comfortable. it can be dressy or very casual. i bought the white and the carbon. it is a different style on a tee. if you notice the front neck and the bottom of the back you will see what i mean. i recommend this highly. i can't imagine anyone not liking it."
1,Comfy tee!! Love the way this tee looks and feels. so comfortable and fun! good length. perfect jeans tee.
1,"Not the same fit as ribboned denim dress I am still in love with my ribboned denim dress from earlier this year. so, when i saw this dress i was super excited and ordered it right away in the same size. it just came and... i'm kinda disappointed. the fit is... shrunken?? kind of like i'm wearing a petite size. it's around 3 to 4 inches shorter, the tie at the waist hits instead right under my bust, and there's some weird bunching happening above my rear?? i kept wanting to pull the whole dress down more, but that's just the way it was"
1,Perfect fall casual top I love this top. it's not just an average tee due to the asymmetry in the seams. it's super soft and comes in some great colors. i wish it was slightly longer on the sides but otherwise perfect tee!
1,"It's a t-shirt I ordered it with a particular outfit in mind as i liked the purple (burgundy) color. ordered xxsp, as with most t-shirts at retailer, they run a little big. xxs seems to be my new xs (which used to be s!).

color was nice , fit was good too, i just felt not ""special"" enough... but if you are looking for a tshirt, then i say give it a try, as it was comfortable and the shape at least is unusual.

for reference, 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist"
1," I purchased in white. the material is a little thinner than i like, but the material is soft. runs tts over all. the arms are long-but i like this in a t-shirt. i will probably pick up another color in this shirt."
1,"Want to wear it everyday Purchased this t-shirt in white. it's lightweight and slightly sheer. perfect for layering. looks cute with a poncho, blazer or on it's own. really wish it was available in black."
1,Very flattering This is my new favorite dress. it's a lovely fall mustard shade. the design really accentuates the waistline. i would buy the other colors in a heartbeat. on my petite frame the dress hits just above my knees.
1,"Not sure... I was expecting to love this based on the reviews and my prior experience with this brand, but i'm a little unsure. the front part hangs a bit too low on my 5'4"" frame, yet i think a petite would have the slits too high on the sides. i'm just not sure it hangs right on me. it's fitted through the arms and shoulders nicely, and looks great with the front loosely tucked. just not what i was expecting."
1,"Great option to the everyday t shirt I bought this top in white and my usual size large based on other reviews.  the sleeves are wonderfully long enough for this tall girl, which means that they are likely very long on shorter gals.  i love the style of this t.  the white is slightly see through, but with a nude color bra works ok. i do wish that it didn't cut up so high on the sides.  this probably isn't an issue with shorter people, but i need to wear something under it to avoid showing skin.  i've tried a white camisole under an"
1,"Great little slip or even summer dress Great quality, flattering cut- could even be used as a little day dress for warm weather! love the detail of the buttons on the back and the delicacy of the straps."
1,So cute! Absolutely love the jacket! wore it out in nyc at a rooftop bar and many people complimented on it. the faux fur is soft and pink color is beautiful. it is trendy but classy and can be worn dressy or dressed down with boyfriend jeans and booties. perfect transitional jacket from day to night =-)
1," I was on my way out the door when i noticed this adorable t-shirt and of course i grabbed one and went to try it on. i love it, it's a different take on a t-shirt. it's comfortable and stylish. i ended up buying the white one and gold colored one. i'm even thinking about grabbing a couple more colors."
1,"Solid long sleeve I was expecting this to be longer. nothing wrong with it, i will be returning it because it was a little short."
1, Lovely color and really nice fabric. not much form to the dress but will be lovely with a belt or jacket.
0,"Not flattering I didn't think top was very flattering and, while in the picture the mismatched hem lines in the collar looked cute in person it just looks odd. this is especially true of the back of the sort where the mismatched hem repeats at the bottom...just looks mis-sewn instead of purposeful. sadly this one is going back to the store."
1,"Great layering staple This will be my go-to shirt for fall! its a great layering piece with just enough detail to make it different than a plain crew neck long sleeve...the neckline is unique & the slit in the back of the shirt adds interest. fit is slim, nicely tailored which makes it perfect for layering. i will likely purchase more colors once on sale! i purchased the dark grey and color is just as expected. my only drawback is how thin the material is - i can see it getting snags or holes easily, but i will deal"
1,"Not for me These jeans didn't fit like i thought , based on the model. i usually wear 25 , but these were snug and i i have snug jeans , lots of them and i wanted looser , flared jeans ,kind of a 60's look. not these. a bigger size wouldn't have improved it . they are a perfectly good jean , love the color but not what i wanted ."
1,"Versatile shirt I was looking for a white shirt to layer with this winter. this shirt looks great on its own, but it has also done great as a long sleeved layer under vests, etc. it's a little thin so i only gave it 4 stars for quality, but it is holding up well so far."
1,"Typical left of center I have many left of center tees, and this one is a part of that same family. i got the deep purple (kind of an eggplant color), which is perfect for fall. the sleeves are long, the cotton is thick, and i love the small details at the neckline and bottom hem. it's not quite 5 stars for me, though, because it is very high on the sides--not too much that you can see skin while standing still but enough if you raise your arms. not a deal breaker for me, though."
1,"Comfort and style I purchased this dress on super sale and i'm so happy i did. it looks better on me than on the model and that's never the case. the material is soft corduroy with comfortable give. it moves with me. true to size (i ordered a size 8 and for reference, i'm 5'2"", 140lbs, 36c). love this staple fall/winter piece. i wore it to a conference for work with footless tights and a black cardigan. i can't say enough how comfortable it is on! it has a structured give if that makes any sense. love it!"
0,"Not flattering I really wanted to love this dress, but it just wasn't flattering on me. i have curves and i was hoping this would hug them in a joan on mad men way (sometimes these dresses that just hang on super thin models can look beautiful in a different way on a more voluptuous woman) but it was pretty shapeless on me. it also dips so low in the back that i would have to get a special bra to wear it. might be right for a more slender shape or someone who can go braless, but it didn't work for this short,"
1,"So versatile This can be worn now on its own or as the weather gets colder it will make a great layering piece
i bought one and liked it so much i bought it in another color"
1,"A dud for me Loved the colors (greenish, coal and white) and shirt texture but the fit was horrible. i sized up to an xl because you can never tell sizing with this line. that didn't help. it fit, although a bit long but the deal breaker was that i looked huge from the side view. since i carry my weight in my mid section, high/low cuts on the side are tricky on my frame. it fit well in the bust over my 34g's and looked nice from the front. i do recommend it. if you have my body issues you might pass."
0,"Cute, but not long enough for long torsos Received this and love the style, but it falls just a little below my waist and i like my tops to be longer.  it'll definitely fit a shorter torso."
1,Great fitted tee Great fitted tee. nice styling. hard to find tees that are fitted-- they seem to make most of them these days like boxes i suppose because it's easier to make. this looks great and feels good. true to size. loving it!
1,Great fall dress Nice dress fits true to size. beautiful mustard yellow and soft corduroy.
1,A good staple in a  wardrobe This is a very comfortable shirt    great basic to have in the wardrobe    it runs a little high on the sides
1,"Love it The dress is true to size, but has generous stretch to it. i absolutely love this dress, i compliments where needed and hides what needs to be hid, for me the tummy!"
1,Cut top This top was really cute but the side slits were just a little to high for my taste. maybe a size up would have worked better.
1, Love this shirt and the details on the collar.
0,"Go go gadget arms! I loved this top when i saw it online, and i still love the idea of it. unfortunately, the execution of the design fell short. i'm 5'4 w/ a long lean torso. i ordered my usual small, and the arms on the shirt were so long! b/c of the way the sides of the top cut up and my 34 d chest, i don't think a petite would work for me. such a cute top, but it just won't work for me."
1,"New twist to simple tee Really cute tee... charcoal is deep and great all seasons. cut high on sides... may need to size up to accommodate - depends on body shape. tried the white, didn't buy--- too lightweight, but could work layered."
1,Seamed scoop neck tee Love it fits great very comfy goes with all
1,"Very soft and flattering I was please with how well this shirt fits, and how flattering it is, while adding a bit of visual interest with the unique neckline."
1,"Great relaxed t-shirt Soft comfortable material- love the carbon color. great everyday casual tee but with a nice bit of detail.
i liked it so much that i ordered a second one!"
1,"Fabulous dressed up tee! I'm always searching for a ""dressed up tees"" and these were fabulous! true to size and great quality!"
0,It's ok The fabric is great quality but it stretches too much around the waist making it look a little awkward. other than that the quality is good.
1,"Love it This shirt was better than expected. the fit is fitted but still flows. it's comfortable and the material is great. it goes with anything, ive tucked it into pants and skirts but i've also just worn with leggings. looks great either way! im going to buy more of this shirt."
1," This is a nice, easy, go to shirt that i will be grabbing for this fall. comfy, but still styled to add a little fun in the everyday white tee."
1,"Yummy mustard Love the gorgeous mustard/goldenrod shade but it's unflattering to my skintone (makes my olive-tan look more sallow). all the versions of the tied dresses that holding horses has come out with are fantastic in fit and flattering to the tummy. if you are busty/broad back/wide rib cage--size up. if you have generous hip/bum curves, give both your regular"
1,"Like it, but not white. This shirt is so cute. i ordered a white, but will have to return it for a different color. the white is very sheer/shee through!"
1,Glam up any outfit I love this kimono! the material and construction are beautiful but the one size fits all may be too big for a petite frame. you can throw it over the simplest outfit and make an instant glamour statement!
1,"Thin & soft The knit is thin.  it's more for a chilly spring or warm fall day.  but, it's not see-through, although a bit light weight.

the style if figure-flattering and fits tts.  i am short and i found the sleeves, length perfect.  so if you are tall, you ""might"" find this shorter in the arms or body on you.

i bought the purple and it's a great color.  love it!"
0,Poor quality Love the design of the t-shirt but the quality is poor in my opinion. i got the white t-shirt and the material is so fragile i can see it tearing or being prone to rips after only a few wears. for the price i thought the quality is not up to par. the white t-shirt is see through but with a nude camisole underneath it is fine.
1,"Run small These are cool jeans to have in a mound of typical denim jeans i have in my closet and these are like a thorwback of the 60s/70s made with modern, high quality denim. this is my first pair of 7 for all mankind denim, so i can't reference how they fit to their other jeans. however, based on typical pants sizing with other brands at retailer, these pants do run smaller than other brands, especially in the waist area. i ended up buying my size but clearly a diet will be in my near future because they"
1,"Super cute peasant top This is a super cute peasant top. super light weight and perfect for summer, looks good with jeans or shorts, perfect for summer, spring, or fall. colors are super pretty and bright."
0,"A wrinkled mess I love anything orange- when i saw this coat online, i ordered it as i loved all the features. the features of the coat are fun- however the coat came all bunched up in the package. i let it hang for a couple of days but the wrinkles were awful and even steaming and an iron would not take the creases away. i tried the coat on - the buckles were poorly made. i ended up returning this jacket."
0," I want to love this top - it is so pretty, but i find the fit very odd. i think it runs big, but the arm holes seem to be cut really low. i would love to size down, but then i think the sleeves would be off. unfortunately, i will have to return it."
0,"Yuck There was nothing i liked about this coat. it was definitely not designed with a chest in mind. the pins on the straps were already coming off the first time i tried it on. i usually like oranges too, but even this color turned me off."
1,"Classy stylish coat It was love at first sight for me! i am petite 5'2 about 115 lbs and the small worked well for me. i usually order xs in most items in retailer, but because they only had a small left in the store, i thought it would work as i do like my coats a little bigger. when i tried it on, it was the perfect size! like the other reviewer said, i could see why it may not work for those with a fuller chest area. i am on the smaller side in that area and the fact that i went up to a small instead of xs may hav"
1,"Pretty but baggy As with most retailer tops, this sweater is boxy and baggy through the middle.  i ordered an xs.  it's a very nice, pretty sweater that i'm going to try in an xxs.  the v-neck does go down rather low so it will need a tank underneath. the lace accents are very delicate and make the sweater look more upscale.  the white is a soft winter white."
1,"Sweater review I bought this sweater to wear with leggings for fall and winter.  the quality is nice, but the color is a bit different than the pic.  it has more brown than true berry in it.  it is very soft and stretchy, but is a bit boxy on.  i am debating whether to keep it or not.  it was a little cheaper with my birthday discount applied, but not sure i'd keep it if it was full price."
1,"Love the lace detail This is a really pretty sweater. it is also very soft (no wool or fur)! yay! it is covers my bum, which i love. the ivory is slightly sheer so you may want to wear a cami with it. i have it on my wish list."
1,"Super comfy dress I love this dress! it's super comfortable and can easily be dressed down with a jean jacket and some sandals, or dressed up with leather and a good pair of heels. the fit is spot on and very slimming, and i like that the length isn't too short as well."
1,Stays put Classic design with nice details. stays in place for those active bikini wearers.
1,"Super cute, flattering to tummy This super cute skirt has a beautiful drape and overall fit. i was afraid the tie at the front would emphasize my slight tummy, but to the contrary, the skirt is flattering and slimming. at 5'3"", the front of the skirt hits at my upper to mid knee. 118 lbs., 26"" waist, 36"" hips, size 2 regular is a perfect fit."
1,"Hip and comfortable Dress is pretty and works are a tunic, too. i'm short 5'1.5"" but the fabric does not overwhelm me."
0,"Wanted to love but doesn't work Super soft, super cute but too short for a dress, too long and too overwhelming for a shirt, and didn't like the look with leggings at all so sadly i'm returning. love the colors, feel and style but no way will sizing up or down fit in a way that was functional...having said that..fits tts i guess."
1,"Better than i expected I fell in love with this dress online and ordered it despite some of the reviews that claimed it cut too high in the leg and couldn't be worn as a dress. i thought it was lovely enough to wear as a long shirt even if that was the case. however, when it arrived  the side hems were not cut too high for me and i have successfully worn it as a dress (receiving many compliments along the way). i'm 5'2 (and a quarter) inches, 117lbs. i ordered an extra small and it fits perfectly. the fabric is soft a"
1,"Pretty top, nice detailing, a bit large. This shirt is made of a thicker material, so you are able to wear it through multiple seasons. i also liked that it is a bit longer. however, it runs a little large, so i would order a size down if possible."
1,"Pretty but boxy This looked more fitted on the model. the xs was still boxy on me, but i loved the eyelet hem so much i kept it!"
1,"Great look for fall. I got this for my girlfriend and was happy they had additional sizes online as we were not able to find this in the store. we loved that this could be worn stand alone, with leggings, or as an over-shirt. it's very versatile and is perfect for your fall wardrobe."
0,"Super cute, poor quality I wore this for the first time today, and after just about an hour, it gently nicked something and got a hole in the pack.  its so disappointing as i love they style and its so comfortable. very poor quality for the price :("
0,"So cute! but way too boxy I wish i had read the reviews before purchasing online. i love how this top looks online but when i tried on the small that i ordered, it was comical. so so boxy. literally, shaped like a square. it must be pinned back on this model. maybe if i ordered an xxxxs it would have worked...or perhaps for a larger person, it may look super cute!
just didn't work on my slim build. :("
1,"Love this! I love this dress! i do agree with the other reviewers - it does come up higher on the sides. it has a hi-lo hem style on me, but i'm short (5'3"") and got the petite xxs and it's not too short to wear as a dress. it's super cute!! if you're short(er) and don't mind showing a little leg, i highly recommend it :)"
0,"Much longer than stated This is an absolutely gorgeous sweater. the colors are just as they appear online, but the length stated for the petite version is way off. i suspected as much from the picture, but decided to try it anyway. the petite small went down to my ankles! too bad. i would have loved this sweater if it were an above-the-knee or even at-knee length."
1,"Exquisite and timeless This dress is beautiful. i cannot begin to express how pleased i am with the design and timelessness of this dress. in my mind, it takes me back to the 20s and 30s more so than a flapper dress as it exudes the simplicity yet elegance of the early 20th century. the champagne color is light and airy and it is incredibly comfortable to wear. i am wearing this to a musical at the tuts theatre in two weeks with pearls."
1,"Bulky This was a splurge piece for my fall wardrobe. however, i will be returning it. it's extremely heavy and bulky. the collar doesn't lay right--it's tall so it wants to flop over but it's too bulky to fold and stay down. i went a size down and the sleeves are huge--wide and too long. it's not flattering on my figure--i have a booty but the sweater doesn't show curves at all. i also thought the colors were dingy, not bright like the photo. i think it would look good on someone tall and slender (als"
1,Effortless elegance Great dress with just the right amount of movement and flow everywhere. perfect to dress up for a night out or wear it casually during the day
1,"Wanted to love it! I loved everything about this dress except the length. that fabric is great, the width of the dress was great...not too slim but not too baggy. but the front & side length was the problem. it is longer in the back which was great. i could have even dealt with the front length, but for my age, the way the sides came up fairly high, just couldn't work for me.
i you are younger and okay with showing lots of leg, go for it! its really cute!"
1,"Perfect I love this jumper! i'm 5'1"" and the 00p fit beautifully. i needed no alterations. i found it true to size. i can see that if my torso was any longer, it wouldn't fit though. i found the quality of the fabric was nice, it just gathers slightly, but you can see that on the model too in the photo. that doesn't bother me."
1,Very cute I really like how this fits. it is soft and the eyelet details are very cute.
0,"Sooo sheer The dress ran big but is tight at the bust, material is sooo sheer and the shape of the dress is off. you can't see the ruffle/ flounce that runs the bottom of the dress."
1,"Awesome look & feel I bought this originally for my daughter but fell in love with it when i tried it on and kept it for myself! it is a cotton/polyester blend so it is very comfortable to wear. the length fits nice as well. i have received so many compliments wearing it with dress pants and also with jeans! thank you for making an item that is both pretty, flexible, and meets the needs of young women (and their moms!)"
1,"Love this skirt! I bought this skirt yesterday and love, love, love it!! very flattering, will go with anything. i am 5'5, 127, and size 6 fit perfectly."
1,"Great versatile dress This is a great dress for me to wear to work, lounging on a sunday and everywhere in-between. i'd even wear it over a bathing suite on a chilly beach. highly recommend it!"
1,"Cutest jacket ever I tried this on twice in nyc and loved this jacket. it is so much cuter in person. my only concern is whether the mesh fabric will hold up over time and at this price point it needs to last more than one season. it has adorable embroidery on it, the colors are vibrant. you need to see this in person."
0," I love cloth and stone and the softness and prettiness of this fabric did not disappoint. this is not a dress, however. it is a long shirt. the sides were so short the you could see where my bum and hamstrings came together. leggings would ruin the look and as a shirt it would be totally impractical. for reference i am 5'8"" and 130 lbs. the small was the correct size, save for the length."
1,"Exactly what i wanted! I love this dress! i will be living in it this fall and winter! the color is perfect, the fabric is soft, seriously it is so conformable and cute! i will style it with booties, tall boots, with vests, wear it as a tunic! i love it as a dress, i didn't think it was too short at all! i'm 5'7"" so things tend to be short on my anyway but i thought this was perfect and hit in the right spots! love love love it!"
0,"So perfect if only the sides did not cut up I tried this on in my usual xs (5'5"", 128lbs) and it fit like a dream. i was instantly in love. until i looked from the side and realized it was cut up way too short. i have a longer torso and shorter legs and this came up past my finger tips if i stood with my arms down. no way could i wear this as a dress. as a tunic definitely though, but i was really hoping to find a nice, versatile fall dress. it was a let down but i still may consider purchasing it because the material was so soft and it f"
1,So soft I really liked this dress. i agree with the others that say the side seam comes up pretty high. i think i'd wear as a tunic or open like the model. i can't justify full price though. tts. my normal med fit.
1,"Go for the grey if you can still find it I bought this dress online in the cream/black combo for an incredible deal. i wasn't thrilled about it when it arrived, even for the ridiculously low price, because the contrast between the top and bottom was too big. the two materials are quite different: the top fabric being much more casual than the bottom fabric, and with the color contrast it just looked like a top and skirt that you wouldn't put together if they were separates. when i went to my local store to return, they had the grey com"
1,"Beautiful dress but runs small This is a very pretty dress with a unique bodice and neckline. however, it seems to run small on top. i can not zip up the top by myself (zipper is in the back) even though i usually wear a size 2 or xs in this brand (i'm a 32d so i'm narrow on top). i haven't decided yet if i'm keeping it because despite the sizing issue, the dress is lovely!"
1,"Nicely draped, beyond basic tank w/ tricky sizing This pink tank is a wonderful addition to my go-to basics. i love the color, which is a nice deep pink that is pretty spot on in terms of accuracy to the online photo. it is a wonderful comfy fabric and the side knot adds nice visual interest to make this top appealing and unique. i also appreciate the wide straps, which means i can wear a normal bra instead of a strapless one without worrying about straps playing peek-a-boo. the only drawback is size. i ordered my usual xs (i am 5'5"", 110 lbs,"
1,Gorgeous I absolutely love this skirt! i purchased both a medium and a large. i found that it ran big. i typically wear a size 10-12. i ended up keeping the medium and it was perfect!
1,"Loving the lines... I read prior reviews and decided to go forward with my purchase. i am so pleased that i did. the m fit nicely. the fabric is not as soft as i had wished. however, i think with wear it will become broken in."
1," I love the cold shoulder trend! this sweater is not bulky, but the thick knit will keep you warm while looking stylish! it is not your typical sweater. if you want something unique, but still basic, this is your sweater. looks great with jeans and khakis."
0,"Strange armhole construction This tunic could be great but there is some weird construction going on at the armhole. first of all, the armhole is way too low! second, there is a totally unnecessary side seam zipper under the arm. since this is a tunic it slips over the head no problem. no need for the side zipper, it adds bulk and distorts the way the fabric should hang at the side."
0,"Quality is questionable Loved the design and print of this blouse.  however, every time i put it on or took it off, i could hear the seams ripping.  definitely wasn't because it was too small either."
1,"Obsessed I don't know how this dress doesn't have more of a following! it's really perfect. i will say, i am tall (5'8"") and lanky. the dress is oversized, but not overly so, drapes beautifully, and will work for any season. fabric is divine. i plan to wear this to work, for travel, on weekends, etc. love the cream/deep charcoal color. at the sale price, this really is a great, versatile find."
1,"So lovely This blouse is so pretty! i love the design, the material, and the pattern is so unique. i love the sleeves and how they billow out just above the elbow and come in at the wrist. i think the amount of fabric is perfect and would not be nearly as nice with less. the cut around the top where it starts to gather and fall is so feminine and modern princess-feeling. i hope they make this same style in other colors and prints!!! i adore it and feel so good wearing it! if i could change anything, i'd m"
1,"Cute, but runs small This top is super cute...unfortunately it seems to run small so i had to return."
1,"Perfect warm weather tank with a twist This is a great light weight tank. true to size, but size up if you prefer a baggier fit, size down for a closer fit. your preference for fit should be your guide. (i prefer a closer fit, so i choose a xs, i am a 6-8 in tops) the arm holes are slim and high so you are completely covered in all sizes. excellent drape, the twist in the front is just perfect! looks great with jeans, print joggers, and even wide leg pants. i imagine it would be fantastic with a pencil skirt - denim perhaps. hope it"
1,"Beautiful but short Liked everything about this coat but the length! it is beautiful and good quality. first, ordered a medium because the fit seemed slight (i'm a 4-6), returned it for a large. unfortunately, the large will also be returned -- the body length is very cropped, not at all as it appears in photo to meet the top of a waistband. i'll hope to find a similar coat with just a bit more length."
1,Cute dress Fits great & super comfortable. i love this dress!
1,Great late summer/early fall top The sweater has a substantial weight to it. i ordered xs which is my usual size and i didn't find it ran big at all. the sleeve length and hem length were perfect. very cute with jeans.
1,Great sweater! I love wearing sweaters when it gets cooler out but hate the bulkiness that comes with them. this is a super cute sweater that isn't too bulky and gives you the sexiness you're looking for! great material.
1,"Size down, way down I typically take a m or a l in retailer tops/sweaters, so i ordered one of each, as this has been on back-order for forever. the medium was swimming on me - and i have a very athletic frame, with huge traps and biceps. i could have easily taken this in a small and still had plenty of length in the sleeves - and i have very long arms. 
---------
this sweater is thick and heavy. there's no way here in atlanta it can be worn anytime other than spring and the occasional very, very cool summer night."
1,Navy cold shoulder sweater I sized down to an xs based on reviews and the fit was perfect. i am 34 b and usually take a small. i like the classic lines with the sexy edge. this is a heavier sweater but perfect for our houston fall and winter. if you size down the sweater has a much nicer fit to it and is not at all loose fitting. it just skims your curves.
1,"Beautiful tunic! I am absolutely addicted to tunics. so, when i saw this on sale, with an extra 30% off, i went for it. i'm glad i did! it's absolutely beautiful. i love the opposing stripe patterns, the hi-lo feature (very subtle), and the tie back. so cute!

if you're petite like me, though, you may want to wear something underneath--it does cut a bit low in the chest area."
1,Perfect for business This top is perfect under a blazer or sweater! the peplum is pretty and the scallops as texture to the tank. love!
1,"Needs to be altered for better fit. Going to alter shoulders straps by shortening for a better fit. petite size would have fit better, but was sold out."
1,"Stunning blouse, but way too voluminous I'm an xl in retailer tops, but large also fit well in this blouse so you might be able to size down. this blouse is so voluminous i am returning it. i'm full figured and have a short torso, so the large billowy swingy body of this blouse does nothing for my shape. i'm busty and the blouse cascades off of my bustline which makes me look either pregnant or much heavier than i actually am. if you're tall or slender, the extra volume might not be an issue.
.
i really wanted to keep this blouse beca"
0,"Not great If you're tall, this dress sits up too high-waisted and this makes your waist look big. it's also kind of thin material on top and stretchy, so even though i'm small chested it made my shoulders and chest look large, but not on a good way. in other words, this dress made me look fat. the length is not bad for taller gals. all in all, not worth it."
1,"Super soft!! Got this in white and love the scallop detail. the material is also super soft and stretchy. i would've absolutely loved this in black, but i feel like the white enhances my hips a bit too much. i think this would be super cute on a taller frame. got my usual xs and it was a perfect fit!"
1,"Cute versatile dress I got this dress in the gray, size small and it fits me perfectly. it hides flaws in your figure and is nice enough that it can be worn to the office and then out later for a date or dinner. i did not try on the white/black combo because i thought the white top part might be too sheer. unlike other reviewers, i think the contrast of fabrics works. i'm not sure why there are negative reviews here, i must have the right body type for it because i love it!"
1,"Runs small This jacket is so well made and absolutely beautiful. i usually wear a size 4 or small in everything at retailer. sadly i ordered a small and will have to return it, too tight on chest and arms. i recommend going a size up. also this jacket is really cropped, probably needs a hifh waist pant to compliment it, otherwise might appear too short."
1,"Adorable dress Nothing wrong with the dress, sadly it's the body i'm putting it on that's less than perfect. fits fine and tts, but just doesn't do anything for my bit wide hips, other than adds to them. hangs nicely, but jersey top and nylon bottom add to the wide hip issue. that said, i think i may still keep it as its a great length (not too short) and a nice, simple dress. really versatile."
1,Simple & casual dress I'm petite and pear shaped so i'm small on top and curvy around the hips and love the way this dress fits. it's a relaxed fit so it's not super fitted and it's loose around the waist which is great. it's a wonderful casual dress to wear with a pair of tall boots. i adore it!
1,"Adorable everyday look! This blouse is great to wear almost anytime! it can easily be dressed up or down depending on the occasion and the accessories. it has a bit more volume around the waist then the picture shows - but that could be because i'm bit more ""well endowed"" than the model. i'm 5'0 and size m/8. this shape looks great on my curves without making me look chunky or stout. the image makes the color look black, but in person the color can pass for a really dark blue in some light. the textile of the fabric is"
1, Super cute. was really pleased with my purchase of this sweater. runs just a little big.
1,"Not too spicy I'm very happy with the interesting print and unusual bib design of this comfortable dress. the bib embroidery is off in some areas. i find that the swath of beige to be too much since it almost matches my skin tone. to break it up, i took the unnecessary waist tie and used it as a bodice trim, creatively knotting, tucking and securing with mini safety pins. i purchased the m petite and though it has a zipper back, i did not have to unzip to put this on or take it off. i have a heavily padded up"
1,Want it in every color possible This skirt is hot. i love it and would marry it if possible. super pretty. the jewel hem looks awesome. buy it! we can be twins.
1,"So soft The fabric on this top is just so soft. it's a thin cotton knit, and drapes beautifully.

the top runs tts, but.....it is tailored to the body. it's not loose and wide in the width. the length hits the top of the hips just as shown.

this works for casual or dress. for dress, i just put a fancy rhinestone pin over where the knot is. btw, i bought this in black, which is why adding the pin glams it up. although i bought it in black, it's not sheer so a cami isn't needed."
1," Love this top! simple, yet so stylish."
0,"Terrible I rarely write a really negative review and retailer is my favorite store ever. but this dress is awful. i ordered the black and white. the fabric is very poor quality. the colors are washed out. i almost didn't try it on, but i did and found that, for me, the fit was terrible (though some of the reviewer pictures are cute)."
1,"Love this! so soft, looks like the picture I love this shirt so much i bought it in another color. it looks like it does in the picture, loose and flowy."
0,"Too bulky I ordered this to wear for a holiday party hoping to have something unique and dressy. it was too bulky at the shoulders and looked like something a football player would wear. the little ruffled flower pieces were random at the top and stuck out in all the wrong directions. it wasn't as elegant as the model pic (is it ever?) and for this price should fit like a glove. went back within seconds. also, it's pretty short, and bulky short isn't flattering on too many people."
1,"Yes to love, yes to life, yes to these pants These are excellent. as previous reviewers noted, they are a thin material, and there isn't much stretch. that being said, they have a casual, work-appropriate men's wear vibe (the extra fabric in the crotch region contributing to this). if you really don't like the extra fabric, wearing them a little higher and closer to the natural waist should solve the problem. the navy is a little lighter in person than on the site, just fyi--it's less easy to mistake for black, which is alright in my book."
0,"Not loving the extra stretchy fabric, part 2 Long-time ag jeans fan. lately though, i'm finding the material is much too stretchy. i wanted a good pair of jeans. if i wanted pajama jeans, i would've ordered them. i found the same thing with the prima jeans i ordered (same review there).
so back both pairs went. 
it's a shame because the color was as pictured and just what i wanted. if only they had been made out of actual jeans material."
1, I don't buy many jackets (retired) but i think they are still useful. i had my doubts about this jacket -- like could they really get the trim straight at this price? but they did. the jacket is casual but sophisticated. i got the grey and the color is just as pictured. i will probably wear with dark jeans and i see several creative mashups with things in my closet. i am pleased and i think you will be too!
1,Perfect layering tank This is a great layering tank that is super comfy! the sale price is a bargain!
1,"You need this. Effortless and super cute! i'm currently wearing my blue tunic for the first time with black leggings and booties - i absolutely love the everyday comfort of this piece! a few have mentioned length as being an issue - i'm wearing a regular s (my normal size) at 5'7"" and find the length similar to the model's. the cut on this is perfect - i was worried that it would look like a plaid sack on, but it's a slim cut that looks polished without needing to be belted. this will surely be a go-to for me"
1,"Slimmer than it looks I like this top a lot - it's cuter in person than it looks on the model -- it's a little heathered. it definitely fits slimmer one me than on the model, and i'm pretty small on top.

overall, nice to see a reasonably priced basic t on the retailer site"
1," Love, love these jeans. being short they come right to my ankle. super soft and don?t require any hemming. i ordered my typical jean size of 26 and they fit like a glove. would love to have these in black and grey."
1,Everyday tights These tights are perfect. they seem like they will last a couple seasons with minimal wear. just the slightest texture and not shiny. i got the beige/brown to layer with dresses/skirts and boots. love.
1,"Impulse buy I was walking by my local retailer and saw this in the window and loved the colors. it's a great combination and looks good with white jeans, and regular denim. i like the cuffs on the sleeves and the textured material. it is a kimono - so in essence it is not form fitting. it's meant to flow over whatever else you have on. i purchased the xs/s and i am a normal size 2 and it looks cute. i got lots of compliments when i wore it! there are slits on either side at the bottom hem as well which allow"
1,"Love retailer's tunics This shirts dresses up anything-tights, jeans or a skirt. love the color and the length"
1,Could be more petite but very pretty! I got size 2p. it comes down a little over my knee cap and i wish it was rather a little above it. i have a small chest about 32b and with a padded push up bra it was still bit loose on the top. i do have a shorter torso. i feel like i could've gone with the 0 petite. i'm a pear shape and more like a size 4 on the bottom and i weigh about 115lbs- there is tons of room to go smaller - it is not form fitting on the bottom at all. has that slight polyester feel but the fabric is beautiful and thick
1," I was surprised how great this blouse looks on! the color and texture are awesome.... very well made, but runs a tad small. this will be my new go to when i open my closet!"
1,"Bought this in both colors! Love this top, super soft and drapes great, even after washing. it is pretty long and loose, but it is so comfy and cute to wear with jeans or even joggers!"
1,"Favorite tank ever Love these tanks so much i have them in every color. i wear them layered under blouses, thermals, henleys, blazers, etc. i'm typically and extra small but the small fits perfectly."
1,I love these jeans! These jeans are so comfortable. they are well-made. they are the perfect pair of jeans. the only thing i do not love is they stretch out a little bit after wearing. i am going to order these again in the next smaller size.
1,Perfect fall shirt Comfortable and soft are two of my favorite words when it comes to clothes. this shirt meets both requirement. it is a great length and can be casual and dressed up. must have for fall and winter.
1," This shirt spoke to me, as soon as i entered the store! i love the colorful plaid, the flattering cut, and the light, airy material. at very least, i think this will be a three-season go to!"
1,"Love this basic! This is the softest, most perfectly cut basic. love the black, wish the white was a true white or ivory instead of heathered. as usual with retailer basics, i prefer the regular length despite being petite with a short torso."
1,"Nice product for the price This product is just what i wanted. it was a great color and nice quality for the price. it is tighter than the model, but i am curvy and that's usually the case. looks cute with a patterned pant and jewelry!"
0," The shirt is amazing in the photo..but when it arrived in the package to my house, it is sooooo dark that you can't see the patchwork. not happy. going to return it. it was a holiday gift."
1,"Easy Bought this shirt in red in my usual size small. it is so comfortable and easy to wear. i am 5' 8.5"" tall and it fall on me similar to the model in the picture. not sure if i can wear with leggings--may be too short in front. i'm looking forward to layering it under sweaters and sweater vests for a pop of color."
1,"Gorgeous, but. I am giving it five stars because the colors and design are so beautiful. but i am a medium, size 6 around 5' 8, and i chose the m/l, which is just too big. i also found a run in the fabric, which is very loose and knit-like in places. but i don't care, i am exchanging for another one in small."
0,"Should have looked more closely at description... This spandex top, in my opinion, is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive, but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is, it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but, as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair."
1," I purchased this top on 2 colors...a great go to....stylish, soft and very comfortable."
1,"Great tunic This tunic is a great way to wear the plaid trend right now without it being the traditional collared shirt. it's fun, comfortable and has great style. the first time i wore it i got tons of compliments! i'm 5'8"" and the back of the shirt goes to the back of my knees, i usually wear a size 12 and the large fit great!"
0,"Just not for me The fabric felt beautiful, and it felt great on, but once i looked in the mirror it just looked too housedress like. maybe because it runs large. the price seemed high as well. i wanted to love it but i had to return."
1,"Interesting fit I really looked forward to receiving this piece, it was however extremely difficult to get on and off. you have to step into it and it is very narrow. it is difficult to get your arms in and i had to have my husband's help getting it off. i am 5'9"" 135 pounds. i have a fit figure. i ordered a medium, i wear a small or x-small for a top and an 8 in shorts or pants. once it was on i was not thrilled with the extra material around the hips and tummy area. it is not terribly becoming, it bunches up"
1,Great staple piece I'm about 10-15 lbs overweight and the material clings a bit. this would be a wonderful top for someone who has a nice shape.
1,"Simple cotton, runs large Simple cotton garment such that the price seems high. if it had fit perfectly there is a chance i would have kept the dress, but my normal size 6 was a bit large and even though it was size petite, also to long in the upper body. perhaps a 4 p would have fit, but it may have then been too small. puzzling for petite to be too long in upper body. love this shape dress and the color and pattern however."
1,"Kimono with kick When i saw this on a model at my retailer store, i fell for it. i love the colors and the weave of this kimono. it looks great over anything denim or chambray in particular. it will be useful for cooler days and nights or air-conditionied places. the knit cuffs hold it in place. i got many compliments on it the first time i wore it."
1,Comfortable Comfortable jacket that your can cross your arms and your back is not stuck.  it is stretchy.
1,Love love love I really love this addition to my wardrobe. the colors are great and it is very comfortable. my only complaint is that it runs large. it would be nice if they had more than two sizes.
1,"Love it Pretty blues! colors are exactly as pictured! fits perfectly; not boxy, not tight, just comfortable! i'm 5'9 and this is tunic length on me!"
1,"Love the stitching details The stitching is why i like this dress. even though the arms and waist were a little large on me, i decided to keep it because of the beautiful pattern. (i think going a size down from what i normally wear would be too tight across my back or too short.) i will wear it with a cardigan, tights, and boots as the weather gets cooler."
1,"Perfect fall tunic I love everything about this tunic : the color, fabric and design! i am very happy with this perches!"
1,"Have to have!!! I absolutely love this top, especially for fl weather.
it's soft and falls just a tad longer in the back and is a little fitted in the bust area with a very feline look.
i had the tank as well and just love the satin trim!
i will say it runs a little smaller than the tank bc i have xs in the tank and needed a small in this!
love it!"
0,"Clingy material The shirt looks a lot less fitted on the model in the picture than how it fit in ""real"" life. size was not wrong, the material was just very clingy. i was not impressed and subsequently returned it."
1,"A must have for every closet! The title says it all...
perfect go-to tank for underneath tops. smooths out lines. purchased in a large, so if you're between sizes, may want to size up."
1," I was first attracted to this tunic by the beautiful, bright colors; tried it on, and it was becoming, comfortable, and perfect for my laid-back lifestyle. i just bought it a week ago, have worn it three times already. i bought the blue."
1,"Yes, but It actually is a pretty good t-shirt, but i wish that i had known that ""white"" actually means oatmeal with bits of grey and beige. i bought three and will now need to return them all. hopefully i can find it in other colors i like."
1,"Nice, but weird fabric Nice practical tank, that i can wear with everything. but, the fabric is kind of weird - overly warm and pulls up around the bottom when i wear it sometimes. i would still recommend it, but just know it's not just a cotton tank."
1,"Perfect top I was in love with this top as soon as i saw it. i love the patchwork and i think it is well put together. i've worn it once (the day i got it, i was so excited) and washed it and it is still in great shape.
i liked it with the sleeves rolled up and the bottom tucked in, as it was a little longer than i'm used to. but nothing too long. my torso is short.
the material is not thick or heavy. and the sleeves and some patches are kinda thin. nice material, but not something to wear if it's very ch"
1,"Nice shirt but beware washing I liked this shirt well enough to order in several colors, preferred it fitting loosely (5'1"" around 100-105 size small). i always look for marine was able and this fit the bill, or so i thought; was so so dismayed to see that after one wash the dye had settled strangely into folds making it look like the shirt had cracks all over it. worse looking on the moss green but still apparent in the black, both no longer wearable.

i am forced to return the shirts but since i do like the shirts i am goi"
1,"Versatile I have these in many different colors, some with stripes. very versatile and i wear them all year around.holds well through the washing. love these tank top."
0,"Not impressed I've worn citizens for almost 12 years now, i keep going back because i have an athletic figure (my thighs and butt are bigger than my waist), and usually citizens fit and hug all the right places and are made with a certain quality expectation - these did not meet any of those standards, the ripped as soon as i put them on. the material seemed cheap."
0,"Love the look, but hem rolls up Great material, and i like the idea of a scoop / v neck combination. but the hem rolls up, making it impossible to wear not tucked in to pants or a skirt (and even there it's a little bulky). it's possible that ordering a size up would fix the problem."
1,"Lovely cami Love this top! i'm 5'7, 145 pounds, athletic build, and the medium falls slightly loosely and very nicely over my hips. it is quite low cut, so i wear a tank under it in a professional environment, but it's fine to wear sans tank top in a more casual setting. i really love the back, as the straps are sexy and show off my shoulders. the material seems to be good quality, and i would order this in more colors if it were available!"
0,"Not for me... I saw this dress in the catalog and on-line and it looked so lovely on the models. i took a chance and ordered it in my normal size small. when it arrived i was a little disappointed with the weight of the fabric, it was a bit light in my opinion. it did have an interesting texture, (suede like) so i could overlook the weight of the fabric if the dress fit well. unfortunately it did not, it rather just hung there and was not flattering on me. it looked wonderful on the model but i keep forgettin"
1,"Super cute top! I had read all the reviews about the regular length being too long (they were out of stock on the petite when i ordered) but i took a chance and ordered the regular size. i love it! it is a little long in the back, but i think that makes it a little more fun than your standard plaid shirt. so cute with skinny jeans and leggings! it is one of my favorite fall tops! i got the blue but might go back and get the red since it would be so great for the holidays!"
1,"Love It's perfect. perfect fit, long enough to wear leggings and cover my behind. it's perfect."
1,"I'll be wearing this one a lot Look carefully at the pics of the back. if this style and the color suit you, just go ahead and order this one. it looks just like the pics, and is light, comfortable and true to size. the kind of top you can throw on when you are in a hurry and look great. however, because the back is sheer from halfway down, maybe not for work if you work in an office. moth is one of my favorite brands at retailer and this one is easy-peasy. i am 5'3"", 34c/28/38 and ordered the regular s."
1,"Very pretty and figure flattering. I just received this top in the mail and i couldn't be happier with how it fits and feels on. might have to wear a camisole under with a bit see through in front. it is very true to size and drapes beautifully with the back being very feminine. i am 5'6"" and the length falls just about the same on myself as does the model. i will wear with skinny jeans with the nice length working well with them."
1,"Great top! I love this top. i am 5'8"", 135, 36d, ordered a small and it fit perfectly. length is long, but i liked it. i paired it with grey jeans and black wedge boots...love this top!"
1,"Love this! This shirt is comfortable, loose, but doesn't make you look like you're shapeless. it compliments."
1,"Fun, colorful top Top was featured in an email ad. i love the colors in both tops and bought both plaids. i'm 5'4"", about 130 lbs, and the medium fits well. it is long in the back, but i like that. if the front were a little longer, i'd prefer that, but the length is ok. the colors are definitely cheery and mood-enhancing, very appropriate for this holiday season."
1,"There's something wonderful about this tee There's something wonderful about this tee. it's the way it fits. it hangs so nicely and is a wonderful year round item. i bought it in black for myself and one for my daughter. she ordered another color and i did, too. when i bought it, one of the gals at the store said it had been such a popular tee this year and, once i put it on, i understood why. i give it a high rating!"
1,"Not just for petites :) If you're not a petite and are reading this, read on :) i'm always on the lookout in the petite section because many times us fuller girls can fit into these. 
________
pros:
- tts for me. i'm normally a size 10/12 (m/l) in the regular sizes. i tried on the 12p and it fit everywhere perfectly, especially at the bust in which i'm a 36c.
- fabric is on the thicker side, but that's what gives it this adorable shape, besides already being fit-and-flare.
- pockets :) i always lean towards dresse"
1,"Perfect pair!! This pair of age stevie capris is everything that i could want in a pair of jeans!! soft, sexy (without being skintight) and the perfect color of blue!! i am 5'3""/108 lbs and the 25 was a perfect fit!! these hit about an inch above my ankle and looked amazing (think legs that look a mile long!!) with booties one night and nude heels the next!"
0,"Just love... I usually wear a s. the reviews were helpful. looking at the pic this shirt does look a little on the fitted side. i ordered a size m & it fits perfectly! the sleeve length is fine too! the colors are dark, not as in the photo. i do like the frayed edge look too. i have some skinnys like that. i had been looking at this shirt for months but thought it was a bit pricey. at the sale price plus the promo discount it makes it very much worth it. no regrets. hope this isn't tmi.. of note: the dark bl"
1," Wow.. love this blazer! it's not as structured as some blazers , but the woven fabric hugs in the right places. fantastic addition and great alternative to the good'ol black blazer.. great versatility work to play. nice weight for fall, but will also do well for my fl winter. it's longer than some of my other blazers, but i like it.. with the front pockets as they are, it makes for a unique design that gets noticed. i got the size 4 and i have broad shoulders for someone @ 135lbs.. makes for a n"
1,"Terrific all-purpose shirt I love this shirt! great fabric, nice quality, flattering fit. i have gotten this shirt in 4 colors. my only complaint is that the color names do not match the actual color.. not sure who named these. the orange is a lovely burgundy, and the white is actually oatmeal."
1,"Great top! One of the best tops i have ever bought! i love he material and the style. the satin trim around the edges adds a classy touch. i wore this top with yoga pants and then with jeans and it was perfect for both outfits! the shirt is true to size. i wear a size small and it fit perfectly (5'7"", 145lbs, 34b)."
1,"Easy to wear The fabric of this dress feels like suede, i couldn't stop touching it. here comes the ""but"": the dress is cut straight down, no definition. the rosette lace is sewn on, like an afterthought just to make the dress not to look plain or cheap. i tried it on with a belt and by itself, and i still feel like it's just a plain dress that i can get at a discount store. i'm a big fan of tracey reese and own a lot of her dresses, and i feel that this is the most plain dress she ever designed. size s regu"
1,"Comfortable fabric, nice embroidary This dress can be dressed up or down. it looks cute w/ a black open sweater and looks great alone. the fabric is very soft. although it isn't fitted, it doesn't have too much material either, so it is very flattering on. the back yoke also has the white embroidered flowers which finishes off a quality look. the pockets are nice and light inside. i usually wear a 10/12 and the large fit perfectly. i was also lucky to get it on sale ;)"
1, I am most pleased with this tunic. purchased it in red. nice quality and very comfortable casual top. it has a flattering cut that isn't boxy for a long tunic so it's flattering. the weight of the fabric is substantial but not heavy or stiff so it doesn't add any bulk which is a bit slimming. it would work well for a wide variety of body types. i may buy the blue as well.
1,So comfy!! Love these jeans! flattering and comfortable!! great length for short girl!! worth the money!
1,"Comfy tee, but beware of color names! I received this tee in grey as gift and immediately went online to buy another!

beware because the color names are confusing. i originally thought it was a mix up in the naming on the website so i ordered the ""red"", thinking i'd get the red colored tee. however, the ""red"" tee is actually a light orange color. the ""orange"" tee is actually a burgundy/red color.

i ended up keeping the orange colored tee although i actually wanted the red color, because i really do love the quality of this shirt!"
1,"Very pretty, but too pricey This dress is pretty and is somewhat fitted in the bodice. it does have an a-line fit in the skirt. the stitching is beautiful. honestly the stitching was a little too bright for me. some may like that, but i was hoping for a little more toned down or muted. the colors are so vibrant in my opinion it almost cheapens the dress. the fabric is cotton and it is not lined. i am 5'9"" and it does hit right about where it does on the model. i am sending it back, because i didn't say ""wow, i love this"" w"
1,"So soft, great fit As the previous reviewer mentioned, this dress is great for a dress that doesn't have a true waist. it really fits awesome. so incredibly soft, high quality material, and the mesh pockets are perfection (pockets that are so small/light that you can't tell the dress even had them when looking at it!). the color of the dress is what initially drew me to it (definitely a different color for a sun dress) and after trying it on in stores i would say 'beware.' though it truly is a rich and different c"
0," Loved the look of this shirt on the hanger. however when on, i found that it puffed out in the back. it's fitted through the shoulders and mid-back but the bottom rounds out and creates a lower hump. maybe it wouldn't on someone taller? also, although this wasn't a con for me, the shirt is darker than appears online."
1,A no-brainer I got this jacket in the gray. the fit is amazing and it is soooooo comfortable. i love that it is a bit less structured - but still looks polished.
0," It is polyester but seems good quality. looks like a girls nightgown with the pattern combined with the baby doll dress silhouette and the overall width of the dress. i usually wear a small but, to look like it does on the model, 6-8 inches would have to go in the width."
1,"Flattering and comfortable Beautiful neutral color in a comfortable fabric. fits tts. i am 5 ft 2 in and went with the petite. it is a midi on me. i have other skirts from retailer from past years in similar fabric and will say that overtime the waist will stretch even if hand washed carefully. so that being said, buy your size in this skirt, don't go bigger to get a longer length. you can wear it lower on your hips if you like it longer which i think actually looks more flattering. in any case, it's a great piece that no o"
0,"Lovely but the cut/sizing is not good This is a beautiful spring/summer dress, and the quality of the materials is great. i wanted to love it. but the sizing is ridiculous! i'm 5'3"" and 115 and i think you could fit three of me comfortably in the xs. while the pictures of the model in the dress don't suggest it has a shapeless cut, it definitely looked like a sack on me. a sack with a lovely print, but still an ill-fitting sack."
1,Like I love the print and quality and safari look to me. it does run tight across the shoulders i would size up.
1," It is delightful, dreamy and yes it is quite right. perfect fit, i wear a size 8 and it was right on!!!"
1,"Wrapped in cozy Great skirt, easy to wear. perfect weight for spring/fall. very comfortable while still looking stylish. the xs fit well."
1,"Beautiful fabric I ordered this in a 4 (34b, 140lbs., 5'8"") because it looked like it would run big, and it definitely does! the 4 fit comfortably but the cut of this dress made me look about 10 lbs. heavier than i am. i am pear-shaped and this dress made me look very bottom heavy, so i returned it. that said, the material is gorgeous!, as it is the perfect weight and the colors are much more striking and complementary in person. if i had a straight(er) silhouette and a larger bust, this dress would have been a"
1,"Cute and comfy These are very versatile pants. you can pair them with a tank top and flip flops and be ready for a casual summer day or pair them with a dressy top and heels and be ready for a formal function. i've only worn these once to a formal city function and felt put together and comfortable. with the pants i wore a black lace button up top, satin peep toe heels, black tuxedo jacket and a chunky necklace...very cute. my husband loved it. i'm 5'3"", 117 lbs and the xs fit perfectly. they only downside to"
1,I fell in love! I am a horse lover so i had to have it as it is of good quality and unique. be mindful that it runs small and fits alittle snug across shoulder also excellent for layering.
0,"Cute Definitely cute and good fit but the distressing at knee is open and will probably get worse, worth it if price lower... maybe"
1,"Stylish sweatshirt This general sweatshirt is cute, stylish and can be dressed up or down. a fresh alternative to the standard grey sweatshirt with leggings for casual mornings."
1,"Boxy but cute! I love the model's pairing of this sweatshirt and was struck by it when i walked in the store! like the other reviewer said, you could dress up or down (despite the ""sweatshirt"" name) and i'm planning to wear it with the galleria corduroy skirt and gray booties. love the stitched pockets on the side! (but i'm unlikely to put anything there since it would probably fall out!)

sizing: definitely boxy as the first reviewer said. i'm solidly a small in most tops, and this one i have a bit of spare"
1,"Comfortable as hoped I was looking for a top that would be comfortable as fall was approaching and this hit the mark! it isn't fitted but it doesn't look sloppy either. though it is comfy and is called a ""sweatshirt"" the fabric allowed me to pair it with a charcoal skirt. i am very pleased with this shirt and would highly recommend it as it can be worn casually with jeans or paired with a skirt."
1,"Great texture I tried this skirt on in a size medium. i am usually a small (4-6, 39 inches around the hips and butt) but there were no size smalls. the medium looked good but the waistline may have been a tad loose. the texture of the skirt is wonderful and it is lined! overall, the quality seemed good and it had a nice heft to it. the only thing i might say is that is is quite long--closer to my ankles and i'm just shy of 5' 9"" and leggy to boot (i wear a 33"" inseam with flats). with tall boots on, you saw j"
1,"Spring staple! Saw these in store and had to have them. online pictures do not do them justice. great pattern, fabric and features. can be dressed up or down. sizing is accurate--i am 5' 4"" and 117 lbs and bought an xs. they fit perfectly. wish they had more colors/patterns to purchase."
0,"Sweater wrap midi skirt I'm so upset that this didn't work out. i'm petite at 5'2 and ordered this skirt in petite, however, i felt like it swallowed me up. the fabric is thick and warm so this is definitely only cold weather attire. i'm the picture it looks like there is a little leg showing, but on me, i feel like a schoolmarm. sadly, this is going back."
1," I received these pants today and they're perfect. as another reviewer stated, ""i would definitely not wear these for lounging"" you can dress them up or down. i feel like these will be my favorite go-to pants this spring. i highly recommend the design and pockets are perfect"
1,"Great everyday shirt with a twist This shirt has much less color variation in person (online it appears vaired, imo). in person it is a darker classic charcoal grey with little to no color variation.
----------
this shirt is very soft, of medium weight, and fits tts. the buttons down the back of the shirt are functional, and the backside pleating ensures you don't show too much skin if you opt to leave one or two unbuttoned.

this is just a nice all-round staple shirt. there is no high-super low shirt tail hem; additio"
1,"Sweater midi skirt I hesitated to buy this skirt even though it was love at first sight. i was afraid it would be to heavy, and add weight. i'm so happy i ordered this one, it'll be a closet staple for me. i love skirts, and am blessed to live in a mild climate in california. i can wear it all year long. right now i can pair it with a slim turtleneck tucked in, with high heel boots, or heels, later can pair with crisp white button up tide at the waist, and strappy sandals, or a tank top, and sandals. it goes with"
0,"Gross! Ugh! i am not sure how anyone is giving this good reviews. i tried small, medium and large on and huge huge huge, boxy, fabric bunched at the shoulders and did i mention it's way too boxy? the fabric and pattern are so pretty but the fit is just awful. i would try this one on before purchasing."
1," I agree with the previous reviewer - the color variation is much more subtle than what is shown online. i would not have bought it had i not seen it ""in real life"". this is a super cute, soft and comfortable shirt. it fits tts and can be worn with jeans, leggings or a skirt. for reference i'm 5""7 and 122 lbs and i took a small but probably could have gone with xs as well but i like the extra room."
1,Beautiful and soft! Love this sweatshirt! will look great with gray pilcro jeans i bought recently. xs fits perfectly and i am usually a s or xs.
1," Not your classic sweatshirt. can be worn with black, grey, mauve"
0,"Frompy I so wanted to like this dress i ordered it for summer graduation and weddings. i usually wear a 4/s and even the xs is was too pig. it drapes like a smock. the material is heavy. the only thing pretty about this dress is the pattern and color.

still looking for the perfect dress..."
1,"Chic comfort I am not generally a fan of sweatshirts but when i saw this on a recent retailer email, i new i had to check it out. the colors are more vibrant in person and not muted like the photo but this wasn't a deal breaker for me. because of the boxy shape, i went with a s. i love the cozy feel and that it is still stylish. i can see this piece getting a lot of use this fall/winter. in fact, i am wearing it right now!"
1,"Loungers I haven't worn these yet but i wouldn't wear them just to ""lounge"" in. i wear an xs & they fit good & tts. they have an elastic waist but it drapes nice & doesn't bunch like some do. the material is soft & hangs nice. & doesn't seems like it will wrinkle. love the pattern of the black print ones. it's black, tan & white & kind of a paisley print. i think it looks better on than in the picture."
1,Great fall dress I tried this on in the store and loved it. it is very comfortable. i sized up one or two sizes. i am very thin and somewhat petite but wanted a little more length. it will be a great dress for fall as the fabric is heavy enough to wear into fall. i think it looks better in person than online. would recommend it if you like this kind of dress. love that it has pockets too. great quality.
1,"Cute for fall! I was debating getting the petite vs. regular sizing. i ended up going with the regular sizing for the addition couple of inches in length. it is very comfortable and not at all a sweatshirt but more of a heavyweight, wider long sleeve."
1,"Easy, comfortable dress I was looking for a dress that had a lot of color. since i usually stick to neutrals, this was out of my comfort zone, but i found this one and loved it. it's comfortable, not clingy, and i can wear a regular bra (bonus!). i wish the waist wasn't dropped, but i think it worked well. i plan on wearing it more in the spring/summer, dressing it up or down will be easy. 

i'm usually a size 12 and this fit true to size."
1,"Cute, flattering, and goes with everything I bought this top to add some more color and pattern to my summer wardrobe. it is really cute and a flattering cut. i just had a baby, so it's perfect for showing some curves without clinging. if anything, i'd say it maximizes my bustline more than i expected, but is still very flattering. i think i'm still getting used to my new bustline ;) soft, comfy fabric. not too hot. i get compliments when i wear it!"
1,"Nice! Very old color and item. a little full, but comfortable."
1,"Great dress Wore this dress recently on a work trip. traveled very well, cut and fabric are super flattering"
1,"Took a chance Purchased this top because of the sale. i got it in the peach and the maize. i think it is big, boxy, and loose but at the sale price it is not a bad top to have. the colors are vibrant and striking. pretty with shorts and capris. i did size down from 2 to 0"
1,"Great spring top I was hesitant about buying this at first because i'm busty (f-cup), but i love this top and have received a lot of compliments on it. and then i tried it on again at home with leggings and loved it. it's a great spring time top to wear with leggings and boots."
1,"Perfect dress This is the most perfect dress i've ever bought. i'm 5'8"" and the length was perfect. the cut is flattering and very slimming. the fabric is gorgeous and the pattern is stunning. please offer more dresses in this cut!!"
1,"So fun! Love this top. bought it in black and first day i wore it to a party and i think everyone gave me a compliment! it is very flattering to my shape. have a bit of a pooch, and can't even tell. looks great with skinny jeans. look forward to wearing many more times"
1,Beautiful Very happy with my purchase. fit very nice! already received compliments!
0,Too wide I was so excited to receive this topped then i tried it on. i am a petite and i normally wear an xs so i ordered it in both a size 0 and a size 2. it was huge! it looked like i was wearing a potato sack!!! i really wanted it to work because the fabric is absolutely beautiful! i am so disappointed.
1,"Pretty, thinner fabric than expected Also, a little on the bigger size, i ended up not keeping the xs petite, as i felt it was a little loose and long (would have been more flattering on me a tad narrower and a bit more above my knee. colors are really pretty and so is the pattern. very comfortable and light. 

xs petite bog on 115 lbs, 30 dd, 26.5 in wasit."
1,"Love the color, but not the fit I wish this fit more to the body, it really does flare out a lot,a adding volume to the person wearing it. the mustard color is beautiful, so is the pink (i ordered both to compare). but the 00 was still big on me (and p). so i passed.
fabric is light for summer, so if you are thin, not muscular, perhaps that would look great?"
1,"Pretty, but unlined! I really love the look and feel of this top, perhaps this was mentioned in previous reviews, but it is unlined, which i hadn't realized when i ordered it. so the eyelet details are will expose skin unless you wear a cami underneath."
0, This top is huge! i'm typically a size 2 or 4. i bought the 2 and its huge. it's wider than it is long. even if i sized down to a 0 it would still be too much fabric. i'm so disappointed! beautiful color and fabric but there's so much fabric. i love a flowy top but this one is way too much. :( i will be returning this top.
1,"Modern shape summer weight top I bought this because i thought it would flatter my boxy big busted shape and it does. however, while i liked the irregular hemline on the model, on my 5'5 frame it hits at a strange place and so i will hem it a little shorter. the fabric is extremely thin and not lined so this is definitely a light weight summer top even here in the south. i love the modern styling but the quality of the fabric is a concern, definitely no dryer on this one."
1,"Fresh fit, great colors I bought this top in the store and love it. i was surprised to see negative reviews online. i am small chested, curvier on the bottom. this top does have a wide and short fit but the cut is flattering. all three colors are beautiful. i wear it with high waist short jean shorts and it looks very fresh."
1,"Print version is beautiful in size xl I ordered the xl and it fits me the same as pictured on the model so it's true to size. the peplum is very comfortable. i love the mix of colors, especially for fall. i've always had great luck with the fit & wear of this brand. i'd love to see this same style done in lighter colors for summer."
1,"Love it! want the blue color too. Fits well, comfortable and flattering. i wouldn't call this pattern fabric purple though. it is definitely multi colored and purple should not be called the dominate color.. the picture is an accurate representation of the color."
1, Lovely top that will be a great year-round staple to my wardrobe. peplum and pleats are flattering and not bulky. good weight for spring and beautiful for fall with a cardigan. looking forward to wearing it with high -rise jeans and and pencil skirts.
1,"Nice material but weird fit I ordered it in two colors because of excellent reviews. nice material, but fit is not for me. i will be returning them."
1,"Beautiful! This top is so pretty. i purchased the peach color. it does run large so you will need to size down. you do not need to wear a cami which is nice in the summer. it will look great with jeans, white jeans, shorts, dress it up or down. its not suppose to fit tight... love it!"
0,"Not what i expexted While i had high hopes for this dress to be my ""go to"", unfortunately o couldn't get passed how cheap the material felt. the cut and pattern both worked on my petite frame, however, the cut out pieces in front are not lines and exposed the top portion of my bra."
1,"Beautiful pattern I lucked out and found one of these in my local retailer and i absolutely love it. fits well, although, i do think that the sleeves run a tad bit narrow when they are folded up, but i prefer the dress with the sleeves down anyway. fits very true to size. i can't wait to wear this with boots and leggings!"
1,"Pretty but Ok, received this in the mail yesterday and tried on this morning, i ordered the size 2 snd it is really big. i notice that the armhole sag and there is a lot of extra room everywhere. i am a 32d on the top so that is why i ordered the size 2, but i will return this and order the size 0 and i hope that will take care of the sagging arm area"
0,"Never been more disappointed... Retailer consistently provides unique, sophisticated and quality made clothing. with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies, i shop with them exclusively. i suppose that i can't expect 100% perfection from retailer-but 99% of the time-that's what i get. this is that 1%...this sweater is truly awful! i cannot (or find it very difficult at least) begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that, had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front"
1," Like the other reviewers have said, this is a wider shirt, but the width done is in a stylish way. i did not think it looked frumpy or sack-like on. however, i found it to be rather short. i bought a 0 regular (not petite), and it fits shorter than many shirts i have from retailer, madewell, etc. which have the same looser fit. i am 5'2, 115 lbs., so it is odd that it fit somewhat short on me...if you are tall, it might bare your midriff some. i bought the peach, which was close to the color pictu"
1,"Cute top I ordered this in a s (for reference, i am 5'7"", 128-130 lb, 32dd, with a 27"" waist), and it fits nicely. i have a fairly large chest, but i didn't find that the pleats laid awkwardly or over-accentuated my boobs, but i got the purple motif so the pattern (and the higher neckline) may have helped keep the top looking cute and stylish but still modest. on me the top drapes a little more than than it does on the model, but it's flattering and not at all sloppy thanks to the fabric, which has a jus"
1,"Can't believe this top hasn't sold out yet I bought this top in 2 colors. it was endlessly comfortable and easy to wear, so i bought it in the 3rd color. it's so versatile that i found myself trying to wear it in too many situations - travel, weekends, and work. the feel of the fabric is gorgeous, but it pills after wear. so when the top went on sale, i bought an extra set of all 3 colors. now i have a set for play and a set for work. i love this shirt."
1," This top is absolute perfection. i don't think the photo does it justice as it looks so much better untucked. i don't even have great toned arms, but it's still so flattering. i got the gray one amd might get another color. great value, as well! i'm petite - 5'1"" and bought my usual size small."
0,Fits like a tent So much extra fabric. not something i would recommend buying online.
1,"Great dress I originally bought this from my local retailer in an xs petite. i think it was a return. i brought it home and decided it was just too big for my 5'4"" 116# frame. i ordered it in an xxs petite and am keeping it. the colters are just so pretty and it is machine washable which is an added bonus. it is still flowy but not objectionably so. it is meant to be unstructured and bohemain i think. looking forward to wearing this on my upcoming trip to italy."
1,"Beautiful I really am happy with this purchase! i am only 5'1 and this will be a perfect dress for me, the cuts hit at just the right spot!"
1,"Love love love! I know a lot of folks thought this top was too big/boxy, but i'm pretty slim up top with a big booty (quintessential pear shape), and i think the shape is totally flattering. your mileage may vary, but with free returns i'd just try it on first.  i sized down one size, which helped, and got the raspberry  colored one. i adore the color -- it's impossibly vibrant, and beautiful for spring summer or fall. the eyelets don't have any cloth underneath, just bare skin,  but they're so small that i don"
1,Better than pictured! Lovely sweater that is good with jeans or a skirt. i ordered an xl and my only complaint is that i wish it were a bit longer in the front. i am heavy chested though so that's how most tops fit me. i ordered the gray/black and it's really nice. i receive lots of compliments.
1,"Great, feminine blouse I absolutely love this blouse...i ordered it in peach..then waited for the raspberry to come back in my size...now i have 2 colors...it runs really large....but putting a tank or cami underneath is fun :-)"
0,Too large and not flattering The top ran too large and it made me look more bustier than i am and rounder in my midsection by how it fell on me. maybe would've been better for someone with a smaller bust. the quality of the fabric was just okay.
1,"A nice twist on the traditional peplum A fun top!
i tried on both the medium and large (i'm between sizes, 5'4"", 34g) and preferred the large. the medium waist rode up a bit on my torso, so the large stayed down a bit. also, the medium pleats did not fall as nicely on my chest."
1,"Beautiful and comfortable! I'm surprised there are no reviews on this blouse yet! i've had it for a couple of months and love it! it looks great in the spring with my flora retailer infinity scarf. the color is beautiful...i've gotten many compliments on this too. it fits well and has a small texture, which makes it more interesting."
0,"Huge, even xxsp What a beautiful, comfortable material and the colors are stunning. i'm so disappointed at the unflattering cut. it fits like a shapeless tent, even the arm holes have big gaps that aren't snug. i am 5'2, 105lbs, and ordered the xxs petite."
0,"Unflattering for pear shapes I wanted to love this top so badly. between the beautiful photos and the good reviews, i didn't think i could go wrong with it. unfortunately, it just didn't look great on. the bust area sagged on my smaller chest, and then the top flared way out from the waist down. it doesn't lay even remotely flat like the photos would have you believe. maybe this would look better on hourglass or slim types. the quality does appear to be good -- the material is weighty and soft."
1,Beautiful colors. comfy. swingy Must wear tank under or i feel immodest due to eyelet holes. beautiful. i'm machine washing w delicates n hang dry. comes out great. easy breezy.
1,"Said no to camo Great dramatic cardigan, wearable art, and not for the meek. i'll wear with a leather skirt and boots, jeans and boots, or a dress and boots. if the lack of closure at top bothers you, attach something --be creative. i like the movement that alternately hides and reveals the statement jewelry worn."
1,"Beautiful, but flawed I bought 2 of these in peach and maize. the fabric is yummy and soft as silk, the eyelet detail gorgeous and the colors are great, however there is too much fabric! if only a bit less, the fabulous swing shape would work. that said, i'm keeping mine if just for the gorgeous fabric and colors. i would even consider buying the third color just to wear around the house, if sale was on sale again."
1,"Beautiful easy to wear dress Weighs nothing. so comfortable. great length, not too short. fits a tad loose, but very pretty and easy to wear. fun print, flattering, casual style with a touch of class. 5'3 110lbs and the xs fits just as it shows on the model."
1,"Drapey I am 5'6"" and wear between a 9-10 pant and m-l tops depending (i would consider myself a pear bodytype bc i have a thicker midsection and flat everywhere else). for this, i ordered a medium and it was slightly loose so if you are conscious about your midsection, ordering your normal size will probably be fine. the fabric is very lightweight like a normal drapey t-shirt would be made out of, just to keep in mind. the draping is really cool though. i would just probably hand-wash/ dry-clean, or if"
0," After reading the reviews i sized down to a 6. once i received it, i loved the fabric and color, however it was so ill-fitting. it's like the designer didn't even use female measurements and used a box to make this top--too wide. i liked it so much that i sized way down to a 0 and it still fit horribly. it is too wide and not long enough. both are going back!"
1,It's all good I had this on my wish list as soon as it came in. i just bought it last week and i'm so glad i did. i bought the purple print and it is really pretty. here in northern cal i can wear this almost year round. i am often right between sizes when it comes to deletta tops. this one is a little bit big i'm hoping that the extra room will help keep it cool during our 100 degree days.
1,"Versatile I bought the purple motif in size medium, my regular retailer size. the fit is true to size. the knit is soft and comfortable. this top can be dressed up or worn casually. it is a great all-around basic top for summer."
1,"Just right This shirt dress has the right amount of body skimming drape and length to flatter my short potbellied square waisted self, i wish they made more versions more colors more sleeves!"
1,Love this tank! I can wear this top with jeans or a business suit. the cowl neck is the best part. it gives this garment a little pop. yesterday i combined it with a black business suit and white pearls. i had so many compliments!
1,"So adorable! I ordered my usual size s in the purple print. this peplum top style, colors/pattern will go easily with pretty much anything.. shorts, pants, jeans & skirts. wear for casual or dress it up. for me the fit is tts. armholes provide good coverage & length is fine. the top has a bit of stretch & doesn't feel restrictive. the waist is banded & a little loose which is fine. don't like tight fitting waists on tops. i like that the waist seems a little lower than other peplum tops at retailer. the skirt"
0," Beautiful fabric, but the fit was off. the picture makes the dress appear fitted than it actually is. the belt is definitely needed, but would leave a lot of fabric in the back of the dress giving it a less than tailored look. 

also, the arms and the top portion are a tad small, so if you have a larger bust/arms, this dress may be tricky. i am a 34b and the button in the xxsp was puckering a bit.i was really looking forward to this one for fall, but was no way for me to make it work."
1,"Super cute, comfy, flattering Love this tank! the purple motif is gorgeous, and the carbon color is a rich dark gray with a slight blue tinge. at 5'4"" / 130# with a fairly proportionate torso to leg ratio, i sometimes need a petite in tops like this to avoid the armholes being too long. in this top i found the petite small too short, but the regular small was perfect. the waist hits right above my natural waist, the hem is just a skosh lower than the model photo, and the armholes are the right length. beautiful flattering cu"

Whatever happened to sizing! pretty print and color but has enough fabric for 2 tops. it is also unlined which is not a huge issue. i wore it with a cami. the arms weren't too gaping for me, thankfully. i tried to make it work with a wide belt but i will have to get it tucked on the sides. i am 140 lbs and got the small. should have gone 1 or even 2 sizes smaller."
1,"Massive! I get that it's a swing tank, and it's supposed to be loose but i got a 00p and it's huge! too much material. with that being said, it's such a cute top that i decided to keep it. i got it taken in about 2 inches on each side and it now looks great."
0," This dress is absolutely lovely. i couldn't leave the store without it, even though it was full price and i have a million dresses. it's just that great. i am 5' 8"" 130 lbs and bought the small"
1,Classy and funky! This shirt has it all. great staple piece to add to your wardrobe. not only is it classy with a pair of black pants and booties but you can add a little spice to it by dressing it up with some funky earrings. found it to be a bit large in the armpit area so i sized down.
1,"Fine workmanship and fresh swing shape I love this feminine blouse and the gorgeous colors on! it's a fresh shape that is truly flattering. i like that it comes in specific sizes so the proportions seem accurate. i bought the 8 in peach; all the colors are very pretty. i am a usual 8/medium and am 34f, so the regular bra-friendliness is essential. this is a new, fuller shape for me. i'm on a quest at this time of year for clothing that feels comfortable in the beginning heat of summer, and this is a lovely choice. you could pair it w"
1,Love this shirt! This shirt is a steal at the sale price. i've received many compliments. it is a swing top- so not a lot of form. i wear a cami underneath & have found the style to be comfortable for work.
1,"Beautiful little dress! Like the other reviewer said, the print is more beautiful in person. i am usually a small in meadow rue, and this fits well in a small. my only issue is that the lining hangs out from the bottom, and hangs out unevenly! hopefully i can exchange it or get it sewed up evenly."
1,Sweet top This a beatifully made top - it does run large so i sized down. it has a very floaty quality but it truly lovely so i kept it and glad i did - i've had many compliments! have run a ribbon through the holes around the waist once to pull it in and it worked really well - it's convertible!
1,Very flattering This top is super flattering and comfortable. perfect summer wear!
0,"Looked like a sack Was very disappointed with this dress. it's very baggy, no shape. felt like an oversized sack. purchased in med. bust area was only semi good fit all else flopped :("
1,"Versatile piece This cute top is made in the usa- yay! it is a flattering cut and looks great under jackets. i prefer the ivory color and feel of the fabric. the black and white was cute, but hung strangely and felt stiff. i am size sm/med, 34c and went with the small. cowl is cozy and can be styled to keep you warm."
1,"Perfect summer blouse Perfect! very pretty and flattering without being too fussy. helps to hide my tummy and very well made. that said i have fairly wide shoulders and a larger ribcage so i had to size up considerably. usually a 4 or a 6 and i needed a 10 to be comfortable. the 8 went on but the fabric has no give so i sized up. i am never a 10 but that's what worked in this blouse. surprisingly it still looked nice and tailored. definately runs on the smaller side.

lovely. worth the full price in my opinion."
1,"Great design and fabric This skirt is so light and breezy perfect for hot or humid weather. the first time i wore it i got compliments all day long. the length is perfect for a more conservative look, i don't wear mini skirts and the slit on the side shows just the right amount of leg. it runs a bit large so i had to go down a size."
1,"Beautiful and flattering I love this blouse. it's really pretty and very flattering. it makes your waist look small. i usually wear a size 6 or 8. after reading the reviews saying it ran small, i ordered an 8 and a 10. the 10 fit perfectly, so i didn't even try the 8 on. it is a little difficult to get on and off due to the zipper on the side. that is my only complaint."
1,Gorgeous..runs small Beautiful airy well made blouse. very flattering and feminine. i normally wear a size 8 and ordered a 10 per the other reviews and i am glad i did! the fit id perfect.
1," Very flattering and love style, print and color. i sized up one size and perfect fit. great with page grey wash skinny mid rise jeans."
1,"Surprisingly nice I'm not typically a fan of pilcro pants compared to paige or other brands like j brand, however, these simple black skinny jeans were just what i was looking for. they hit perfectly at the ankle and look great with a bootie. they are quite stretchy and i like my black jeans truly like a legging, so i sized down 1.5 sizes. i'm typically between a 30 and 31 and i purchased a 29 in these. initially they were snug around the waist but eased with wear. the material is flexible yet sturdy."
1,"Beautiful This top is lovely; great colors for spring, light material, flow-y, and the cinching below the bust line creates a super flattering silhouette. i did have to size up to a 2 (i'm almost always a 0) to make some room for the girls (i'm a 32 c/d depending on the brand), so larger chested women may want to size up, but it's well worth it"
1,"Beautiful This blouse is romantic and timeless. the tonal print is lovely, the peplum cut flattering. i followed the advice of other reviewers and ordered one size up, which fits perfectly. it has a hidden side zip to make for easier off and on. i love the mix of cotton and silk which makes it breathable and lightweight. thank you, retailer, for finally making a blouse with natural fabrics that do not need a cami underneath! perfect for warm climates."
1,"Runs small only because of ""vanity"" saizing I used to be a solid ""2"" then had to move down to 0 and 00... #i am 5'1.5"" and 115 lbs#, in this definitely a 2. the tighter part in the fitted waist is why i recommend peiople sizing ""up"" #if you are between sizes, choose bigger, teh cutis so flattering, it wont matter#.
the colros are really pretty, the flow of the shirt is romantic, sleeves are forgivin can't go wrong. hte back is a little longer, and covers the tushy. i can see this with flared bottoms, or pencil skirt or skiny jeans, even"
1,"Great fit, color runs I love the fit of these pants. 5 starts for that. i wish the pockets were a little closer together, but it's not the end of the world considering how well they fit. the real drawback is that the dye runs like no other pants i've had before. i had them on for a few hours and my fingernails had turned green and my skin was a greenish color. i am going to try to soak them in water a few times to see if that helps. i would still recommend these pants, but wash them a couple times before you wear the"
1,Runs small I love this blouse but my normal size didn't even come close to fitting me. i think i would have had to go 2 sizes up. too bad cause it is a beautiful top. not good for us busty girls though.
1," This is a very feminine and pretty top, but it runs really small. after reading the reviews, i ordered a size larger; however, i think i should have ordered 2-3 sizes larger."
1,"Classic anrtho I love this top - it has the pattern and detailing that i feel like retailer used to do consistently, but often skimps on now. tit definitely runs small - i usually wear a 6 in retailer tops (sometimes a 4) and the 8 is quite fitted on me."
0,"Poor quality I bought this t-shirt in pink, blue, red, grey and black over the past year. every one of them except the grey, has gotten little pin holes in the front of the shirt below your waistline. i've returned them all. the fabric is thin and the quality of the t/shirt is terrible."
1,"Beautiful but runs small This is a gorgeous blouse, but it runs small in my opinion. i consistently wear a size 2 in moulinette soeurs, and i'm trying to decide if a 4 will still be too small, and if i need to exchange for a 6. construction and materials are lovely, just consider sizing up if you purchase this blouse."
1,"Pays to read reviews Based on the two reviews on this skirt and, for the sale price i purchased the small--i 'm usually a large/extra large. i carry my weight in the middle, and this skirt stills works. very sofisticated striping, slimming! i haven't experienced any slipping, but i haven't worn it for any great length of time yet. there are numerous ways to create chic looks."
1," Beautiful top but runs very small. based on some of the reviews that i read i ordered two sizes up from my usual size and it is still a little tight in the chest and around the ribs. i would like to exchange for the next size up but it is sold out in that size. considering how small this blouse runs it would have been nice if retailer had ordered some extra tops in larger sizes as i am sure that many people will have to size up. regardless, i love the blouse and would definitely recommend it to an"
1, This top is adorable! runs a bit small but so cute worth the price and tons of compliments!!!!
1, This blouse is very beautiful and flattering. it's just a little bit see through so i will wear a cami underneath. as with sizing i did size up as the other commenters recommended to do so.
1,Perfect peplum I purchased this blouse for an easter brunch and couldn't be happier! the feminine/romantic print is a gorgeous addition to my spring wardrobe. i've paired it with a pencil skirt and heels for a dressier look as well as my favorite ag cuffed denim and sandals for a more casual daytime look.
1,Great little blouse Light and airy. runs really small. had to go up 2 sizes. a little pricy but overall a cute blouse. not your typical blouse.
1,"Very pretty and flattering This top is very pretty and figure-flattering because of the way it nips in under the bust. the neckline and color are also flattering. however, it runs a bit small and you need to get the right fit for the bust, balancing the band under the bustline with the roominess of the chest area. there is a side zipper but it can still be a little tricky to get on and off. i wound up not buying it due to the price, but i'd probably snap it on sale."
1,Beautiful top but very small When i saw this top.... i had to have it.....runs very small... would size up especially if curvy on top.......sheer but not too sheer...... feels and looks delicate...... no problems so far
1,"Cute top. sizing not correct. I just purchased this cute top at my local retailer store and definetely the size is way off! in blouses i wear a size 6 (small or medium) with a 34b bust, tall and slender and i had to purchase a size 12 (what????).

overall so cute and could not pass it up. good luck. try it on before purchasing."
1,"Gorgeous and so very feminine! Beautiful,delicate and unique cotton blouse that accentuates the waist and falls nicely down the belly. i love the floral print, very appropriate for spring/summer. i agree with the other reviewers who've mentioned that it runs small. i have a bust size of 34 dd and waist size 25 and i had to size up to 12. nevertheless, i am really looking forward to wearing this with a pair of skinny jeans and some nude pumps for a girls night out."
1,"Yes! Oh my goodness, i paid full price for this dress because i loved it so much. i styled it with a cream lace poncho , also from retailer, and it is gorgeous. at the sale price, you can't lose."
1,Love it This jacket is really cute. i tried in in a large in the store and was too big so i took a chance and ordered medium on line. i have broad shoulders so i was a bit worried. it's perfect. very fitted and cropped. but will look great to throw on over a dress. for reference i'm 5 foot 6 inches and a 34 c. 132lbs. slender but athletic. medium was perfect.
1,"Fantastic quality, shows bra straps in back I have always love tracy reese products. this blouse is really fun, nice fabric and the proportions are perfect. but why does it have to show the wide band of my bra across my back? the cut out dips low so i can't imagine a bra that would work with it. it's a 70's hippy themed blouse- maybe the designer expects us to go braless? unfortunately i'm going to have to wear a cami underneath it. my girls need support!"
1,"Spring is in the air What a beautiful harbinger of spring! this blouse is so lovely and uplifting. for me, tts. i bought the size 4 (34-b) and it fits perfectly. this is a fitted blouse especially in the waistline so, i understand why some say size up. the print is pretty with muted shades of pinks and burgundies. the detailing of beige lace and the tiny buttons on the waist adds a very feminine touch along with the added interest on the back of the blouse. the fabric is soft but not overly sheer."
1," This is a beautiful blouse that runs one to two sizes too small. i usually wear an 8, maybe a 10 on a bad day. i couldn't get into the 8, the 10 was uncomfortably tight, and even the 12 was snug (i haven't worn a size 12 anything since i was pregnant years ago). i think this blouse would look best on a woman without any curves as it adds curves to any woman's body. since i already have curves, i felt like jessica rabbit in this blouse. it was too much for me. again, lovely blouse, but i would no"
1,"Beautiful spring blouse I love this blouse! it's very flattering- gives the illusion of an hourglass shape. the fabric feels soft and flowy, and the pattern is pretty; it does need a camisole underneath because it's kinda sheer. it does run small! i usually wear a size 0 in retailer clothes, but i bought a size 2 in this shirt and the sleeves are still very snug around my forearms which is unusual for me."
1,"My favorite dress This dress is probably the most comfortable dress i've ever had! the fabric is very comfortable and breathable, and it flatters my straight body type."
1,Classic Great romper i personally would not wear it for ever day - i will be wearing it for a beach cover up while on vacation. for reference i ordered a m and am 130 34b.
1," Very feminine and romantic blouse, i love it. it runs small as other reviewer said. i had to go 3 size up, as i want to wear a cami under it. the fabric is soft and sheer. the design emphasizes the nature curve of a woman's body, in a good way. back is longer than the front part. if you like romantic, floral prints and soft fabric, this one is a winner,"
1,"Beautiful spring blouse, but 16s sold out in feb.? I saw this gorgeous blouse in a store over dark blue jeans on feb. 19. of course, the store stock only went up to a size 12. typical. with the way the 12 fit, i knew i had to size up from my usual size 14, and i did. i ordered it in a size 16, and it arrived on monday, feb. 22 -- with lightening-fast speed. it is breathtaking and fits wonderfully. i like the top button undone, the buttons are gorgeous, and the blouse is very retro, circa 1973, but you definitely have to go up one size. the only"
1, Love this top! but unfortunately i returned it for exchange coz it was too small for me. hoping there's a sz sm in stock.
1,Romper rules Overall great romper! i have a long torso and thicker legs so i sized up to a small and i am very happy i did. the shorts are a bit on the shorter side and go upon the sides so another reason to consider sizing up. the quality is great and super soft chambray with a trendy tie up.
1,"Very pretty! This is a very pretty blouse. the fabric is lightweight and very soft. i read the other reviews and this does run very small, i ordered two sizes larger than i normally would and it fits very nicely."
1,"Beautiful, light and flowy I was hesitent to order this, was worried it would be too shapeless. i'm glad i ordered it as it is light and flowy though not so much that it makes you look like a shapeless tent. the colors are vibrant and the smooth fabric feels good against your skin. it is lined. i had no issues with the bust (i'm 38c). i wish it were an inch longer (i'm 5'9)."
0,"I had such high hopes I had really high hopes for this shirt after reading the reviews. first off it runs really small. i usually wear a small or medium ( 4 or 6) i couldn't even get the 6 on. i probably could have even done a 10. the fabric was extremely flimsy. i was almost afraid i was going to rip it taking it off. other than the sizing and the fabric, it just wasn't flattering on me."
1," I love this denim jacket! it's just a basic light denim jacket with a casual, pre-worn, soft feel. i like how it's slightly cropped. i think it runs fairly true-to-size, possibly a little on the small side. i am 5'6,"" 125 lbs., and 34c and i ordered a medium for a more relaxed fit. if i had wanted the fit shown on the model, i would have ordered a small ? but i prefer jackets to be a bit looser. i love it!"
1,"Beautiful fabric but poor design The fabric is beautiful, a bit sheer, but overall lovely. however, the sizing is really off.
fyi: 36c, broad shoulders/back - my usual size in a fitted top (this one is very fitted in the waist and bust) is a 12. i tried the 12 and 14, and the side zipper wouldn't come near closing. it is very, very nipped right under the bust.
so, if you have no bustline and a super small waist, this top is for you. if you are like me, high waist and straight up and down, this is a pass. in fact, it is really h"
1," I love it! the fit is very flattering. i read in another review that the top runs small, so i got a small instead of an extra small and it fits perfectly."
1,"Lovely, but snug! This is such a lovely top and i am so happy i was able to snag it on sale! trust the other reviewers that it does run small! i am normally a 0 or 2 on top, and i got the 4 - and it's a bit snug! it is very fitted below the bust, but that's what makes it look so nice on. i would definitely recommend, but know that sizing is off."
0,"Looks good online Loved this online, but the xs was too big and the material was too bulky."
1," I bought the black leggings and love how warm and comfy they are. i wore them with a tunic and boots to work, and people were surprised that they were leggings. the ribbing makes them nicer than plain black leggings. i want another pair, especially for the price!"
1," This dress was gifted to me and is a perfect compliment to the holidays. i can't wait to wear it! the bottom portions shines (i am a devoted lover of all things sparkle and shine) but it really stands out with the darker background. the pleats hide imperfections in body shape and would make a flattering dress on most figures. i also like that the top layer extends below the bottom one, leaving little extra sheer to tastefully show more leg."
1,"Gorgeous & well-made I love this skirt! as a fan of different textures and pretty things, this piece exceeded my expectations! i am always a size 0 or 2 in retailer dresses and the 2 fits like a glove. the length is perfect - just above the knee. ever since i wore a valentino dress with a similar thick, neoprene material, i've adored the feel of it! everything feels firm and put together. the colors in this skirt are beautiful and the pattern is feminine and romantic. it will pair well with lots of different tops too!"
1,"Beautiful! This dress is just so beautiful. i purchased the teal with beading at the hem. the beading is subtle and beautiful. i'm wearing this do a spring wedding, even though i believe it would be best in cooler months. i so wanted the plum option with the flower aplique at the hem - wouldn't that be perfect for the spring wedding - but all gone!
note - the teal with the beading - the beading weighs a bit, enhancing the lines of the dress - doesn't stick out, doesn't make you look like your wearing a dr"
1,"Comfy 36dd, 10/12 in tops, 12/14 in bottoms, bought size m/l
very cute pattern on the grey leggings, and the fleece lining is warm. they are thick too, so even stretched they are not see through. i would say 14 would be as large as these bottoms would fit as they are snug, but fine for wearing under skirts and dresses."
0,Not as listed Does not say ribbed. did not want ribbed. would not have bought ribbed
1,Beautiful dress Beautiful dress. the dress appears more blue in the picture- it is actually green. made well- i love it!
1,"Perfect These leggings are so warm and comfortable. they're thick enough to wear as pants, and they don't stretch and slide during the day. i wish they came in more colors!"
1,"Beautiful details! I'm a sucker for beaded detailing, so i couldn't resist this blouse. it's so beautiful and fun! i can't wait to wear it!"
1," Love this top..got it in both orange and white and always get compliments, especially on the orange color - beautiful and vibrant color! very comfy top and washes well with no problems. the style does swing but not too huge."
1,"Great fleece lined leggings.... I'm about 130 lbs. and 6' tall and usually a small would be my size. these fit, but i would be more comfy in a m. they are stretchy, soft and opaque. perfect for under a couple sweater dresses i picked up by retailer!!! will be re-ordering."
1,"Great leggings! I really love these leggings. the different textures that all the colors have make them interesting. quality is great. i am 5 1"" and 125lbs. the s/m fit pretty well but i wish there was a xs option. but still would not hesitate to buy again!! i actually went to retailer tonight to purchase all the other colors,...that's how happy i am with this purchase!"
1," $20 for super comfy, warm leggings. bought two pairs for myself and another pair for my mother. let's be honest, i'll probably be buying another pair."
1," Love these leggings!!! soft, cozy and yummy feeling! can't wait for the weather to get cooler! these fleece-lined leggings will be a new staple this winter!!!"
1,"Runs small I love these jeans, but they run small. i recommend ordering one size up."
1,Great garden party dress I bought this to wear to and english garden themed party and i loved it for this event. it is very bright maybe even more than the pictures if that's possible and the skirt is was long on my 5'4 frame so i had to get it it hemmed several inches so that it didn't give the 50's housewife look. it was comfortable and i the skirt had just enough poof to make me feel great. i could wear a regular bra but not sure where else i'm going to wear this but i'm going to try to come find another event worthy
1,"Awesome leggings These are the best leggings i have ever worn - and i wear a lot of leggings. i am 5' 8"" tall and 127lbs. i bought a s/m. they very soft and warm. they stay up perfectly, and do not pinch or make any lines. i am amazed that they are so inexpensive. i am buying 2 more after this review!"
1,Perfect occasion dress I purchased this dress for a black tie optional wedding in the mansions of rhode island. it was comfortable and appropriate. i received so many compliments from strangers. wonderfully twirling dress for dancing too!
1,Just beautiful... I love this dress. even more beautiful in person ??
1,Excellent product These leggings are awesome quality especially for the price. they are warm and form fitting. they are thick and the design is nice. i plan on wearing them all winter!
1,"Amazing! These leggings are amazing. by far one of the most comfortable pairs that i own! i should have ordered more. i got a m/l and they fit perfect. the detailing is awesome, and they even stay opaque when you sit, so you don't have to worry about them being see-through. great buy!"
1,Runs small! I loved the look of these jeans-super cute-however they were way too tight! i ordered my usual size 31. they don't fit like a darker pair of serif jeans i own. back they go ! i'd be curious if anyone else found these to run smaller.
1,"Beautiful! fruns small for typical retailer sizing I love this skirt! i wasn't sure about the mix of the back pattern with the front but it works! it is great for work at a less conservative place and for dinners out too! the quality is great - the skirt is a fine silk, ant it is lined, so you don't need a slip. i think it fits perfectly for my body type, and while it runs big compared to typical retailer sizing, it is true to size compared to other stores in the petite sizes anyway. i am normally a 0 petite, 5'2"", 104, waist 24.5"", hips 34"
1," Great leggings for the price. they are ultra soft and stretchy. a great pair of leggings to relax in. they are very stretchy and only come in 2 sizes s/m, l/xl. i am 5' tall and they fit fine, because usually such generic sizing is too large for my small frame. they are a bit long for a petite person, but tucked into boots and nobody will know."
0,"Skip it This skirt looks and feels cheap, and the color is much more green than pictured. additionally, i comfortably wore a size 4 and then lost a few pounds, and this is still way too tight to be flattering."
0,Super itchy! Super itchy! had to return.
1,More like hot pink in color And runs large. i'm always a size 8 in dresses and the 8 was too big. i would buy it in a 6 if the color was closer to what i'm seeing online.
1,"Not as thick as you think I was expecting these to be the normal thickness of everyday leggings, plus fleece. instead, they're more like thicker-than-average tights. still warm, though there's a weird seam on the inside of the thighs that takes away from some of the comfort. not so bad that i want to return them, but not what i was hoping for, either."
1,"Soooooooooooooo pretty! I never buy prints.....but this was so understated and elegant i could not resist!
just received and it is lovely!
beautiful soft hues with the softest of pattern that will look fantastic with jeans.
the buttons are beautiful and a special touch!
will be wearing this top often........pretty, soft fabric, comfortable fit and a ""goes with everything and everywhere piece!""

reminds me of a monet watercolor.."
1,"Recommend-yes!!! husband loves it!!! My husband rarely seems this pleased and he always likes to see what i try on. oohs and aaaahs galore with this one! let's let him review this one....he says he loves the vibrant color, length, and the way the top is perfectly fitted. he was impressed with the lining and the ""mesh"" at the hem that keeps the 'flare' in the skirt (i had to explain that one)! he likes the way it looks with a sweater and without and said that i could use more than one of the many pairs of shoes with it that he sees"
1,So comfortable! These are the best leggings! they were so comfortable that i wore them all day and then to bed; i didn't want to take them off. i'm hoping to get a few more pairs.
0,"Bulky and big The material, deep color and design are gorgeous. however, the dress is just too bulky for my 5'2"" and 110lb frame. i ordered a 0p, and it just wasn't flattering on me. it's somewhat tent-shaped so the fact that it's not at all fitted and has a thick lining made me look larger than i actually am. i'm so disappointed because the dress really is beautiful otherwise."
1, I have these in grey and i love them! they are so comfy. i got them in m/l even though i am a s/m because i like the loose fit. they are very soft.
0,"I wish! I really wanted to love this shirt. it looked so nice and cool for summer and i don't own anything purple. the color was really nice, very subtly feminine. i am a little too short for this style though. i am 5 ft. 1 inch, 105 lbs ordered an xxs and it was still too wide. the side slits came up a little too high for my liking, but i easily could've stitched those up a bit and they'd have been fine. i think this would look great on taller women, but on me it looked like a dumpy sack."
1,"Beautiful dress! So much to love about this dress! the color is exactly as pictured in the video, not photos. the fabric is substantial, beautiful colors. the dress is well constructed , back zipper and is easy to put on and take off. it is not only lined but has a crinoline built in to the liner! it's not super puffy, just enough to give it some flare. i am 36b, 5'8"", 155 lbs and bought a 10. it fits me perfectly! the shoulders are a smidge too big but not enough for me to have them taken up just yet. oh, and i"
1,"New ""hot pants"" for winter leggings I needed a legging to wear with boots. makes sense that if it is cold enough to wear boots in socal then it is too cold to wear thin leggings. try to find warm leggings....almost impossible until retailer put fleece lined leggings in their catalogue! the leggings have a vertical knitted stripe which elongates the leg and they are warm! perfection in garments is very rare but these leggings are hot."
1,"Very comfortable denim These are great jeans and worth every penny. they hug every curve and have just enough give in the places that you need them. i find them to be very figure-flattering and dressed them up with high heeled boots and a nice blouse. even though i'm petite, i ordered a regular in my size (26) because i wanted the length of regular jeans as opposed to ankle length."
0,"Way too small This is a beautiful skirt, but runs very small. i usually wear a size 8 and could not get the side zipper closed....at all."
0,Too small I usually wear a 6 and ordered two other skirts at the same time. the other skirts fit perfectly and this one was more like a size 2. very disappointed for i really liked the idea of it.
1," Really comfortable, great for casual event or everyday wearing. best style with jeans."
1,Comfortable Love the leggings. very soft and comfortable. i ordered two pair -one s/m and one m/l. the s/m fit better on me but both will work.
1,"Glorious These pants are so warm and cozy and comfortable. they are like cashmere for your legs...so amazingly soft!! and for that price, it's definitely worth getting all the colors!!"
0,"Too ruffly I had high hopes for this top, as it looked great online. unfortunately it was much more ruffly in person and not my style at all. it was a lot of fabric and poofed out too much -- reminded me of a child's top. sad to return it!"
0,"Too big I'm a size 28 jeans 5'9 with a bubble bottom. these were falling off of me around the hips. these are warm. i was expecting them to not be sheer since they are fleece lined but when i sat down i was shocked to notice it. it doesn't matter functionality wise because i never felt a ""draft."" they look good and are well made but i will be returning due to the lack of fit."
1,"Affordable, soft, warm leggings I wanted these leggings to wear under dresses during winter to keep my legs warm. they get the job done and for an incredible price. they are soft and lined with fleece on the inside. i'm not sure the ribbing on the black is necessary but it's subtle and i don't mind it. they are a tad long on my petite frame but since i intend to tuck them into boots, the length not a problem. my only quibble is that my first pair arrived with three snags on one leg. retailer kindly sent me a new pair for"
1,Great deal Love how these fit! they are warm and such a good price! i got 3 pairs. i washed mine in a garment bag and it washed just fine. i hung them dry.
1,"Dazzling! Truly the only word that comes to mind when i think of this dress is dazzling! the pictures online just barely do it justice...if you have an retailer nearby, check to see if its available in store and go check it out in person. it does not disappoint! every year around this time, our beloved retailer seems to come out with this style of dress. in the years past they have all been different and beautiful, but i think they have truly outdone themselves this year. this dress is a deep emerald green..."
1,Comfy and cute Really comfortable leggings! not see through and at a great price!
1,"Perfect cold weather leggings! These are my new favorite leggings. they have everything i need - soft waist band that doesn't squeeze me at all, not overly long, subtle ribbed texture (black pair) that make them feel just a little nicer, and most importantly they are not see thru at all. so soft on the inside too. and this price is nuts too, i'm so happy with these!"
1," I bought this in the green and i had to try a few to get one that sat well- in fact i tried on a size above my normal size and that particular dress was shorter and tighter than my normal size. when i reordered my normal size, it was a pretty good fit. i kept the dress but am still on the fence on whether or not i should actually keep it- it took so long to find one that fit well that it missed the holiday events where i'd hoped to wear it."
1,"Great leggings These leggings are a quality product at a great price! i ordered these for my daughter and she loves them. warm and comfy, she wears them all the time."
1,Love these shorts! These are super comfy and a great fitting everyday short. the embroidery gives them a nice touch. i am ordering another pair!
0,"Almost good Maybe it's just me, but this skirt had a little more volume than i was expecting. i'm 5'7, around 125lbs and the small fit me well. i like that the waist is elastic in back providing some give, but allowing the front to look smooth. pockets are always great. i got a striped henley from retailer (which is awesome) to tuck into it & was excited for the 70s vibe.
the problem is that it fell an inch or two longer on me than the model, and i already worry about midi skirts appearing frumpy without the"
1,"I love this dress I've worn this dress to two summer weddings and i couldn't be happier with it. this dress is extremely flattering. i usually wear a size 12, but i returned the dress for a size 10 which fit perfectly. the exact same dress, but in a different color was being sold at another major store. the other color wasn't nearly as flattering (but still cute) and the price was comparable."
1,Love it! I bought this dress in the store and realized that it was a little too long for my frame...i'm 5'1. i then found it online in the same size but in petite and it fits perfectly! i got a ton of compliments and i wore it to a holiday wedding and am planning on wearing it to several other occasions over the holidays. would def recommend this dress.
0,"Foamy material I stumbled upon this item at my local retailer, and immediately had to true it on. the colors are so lovely in person. after trying it on, i was disappointed :( the material has a foamy/air feel to it, and the skirt seems to run small. needless to say, i didn't purchase this item."
1, Liked everything about these but they should say in the description that they're ribbed.
1,"Super purchase! I couldn't believe the bargain price of these leggings, so i took a chance and ordered all 3 colors. when they arrived, i was equally pleased to see how soft, cozy and warm they were and how nice they looked with all my oversized tops. also interesting is that the textures of all 3 are different. the black has a vertical lined texture, the lavender has a cable weave texture and the gray is untextured. wearing them is going to be a pleasure!"
1,"Flattering for a summer wedding Loved this dress. fit like a glove, so flattering, and perfect for a summer/fall wedding. material is substantial and dress is well made. i'm 5'4, large chest, and curvy, and a size 6 fit perfectly. longer than seen on the model for me, but i actually love it being tea-length. 

a strip of tulle attached to the lining underneath the skirt to help it ""poof."" i removed it, but looks good either way."
1,"Runs big I think the shirt is supposed to be a relaxed  fit, but i could have definitely gone down a size"
1,"So amazing From quality, to design, and overall comfort...these leggings have it all. they are so so soft and feel and look amazing on. i bought the black and i love the ribbed detailing. it's just enough to add a little something. i ended up buying the other two colors and another pair of black! for the price it's more than worth it."
1,"Such a cute top! Just got this top in the mail today, and i love it. i bought the white in a small, and it fits as pictured on the model. the fabric says it's cotton, but it's a substantial fabric and feels as soft as silk. the bodice is lined, so no bra lines show through. the tiered part of the tank is not lined but is not really sheer or see-through. the arm holes are not too large, as sometimes happens on me when i wear sleeveless tops. i think i'll be wearing this one a lot this summer, and a lot of summers"
1,"Snag this if it pops up! I normally stay away from dresses like these because they have a tendency to make my tall, hourglass frame look like i had one too many burgers. however, i saw one left in the store and was drawn in by it's color and beautiful sequins. my thoughts below:

________
pros:
- exactly as pictured. i got the purple option, but i did see another lady grab the green. both are beautiful in different ways.
- like another mentioned, the sequins on the bottoms gives some weight to the dress, but in a g"
1,"So happy i bought this skirt! I love this skirt. it does run a little small, i ordered an extra small and it is tight at the waist, but still works. i have received more compliments on this skirt than maybe anything i have owned. i've been stopped at the grocery store by people telling me how much they like it. i also work with kids, and they all love it as well."
1,"Maybe not for the tall I'm 5'9"" and these run true to size for the fit but having long legs by the end of the day they start to sag down in the crotch and hit me about mid calf straight out is the package. they wash up perfectly and are cozy. if you're of average height these will probably be your favorite."
0,"Poor quality This top is beautiful in design, but sadly, i will be returning. it is hand wash, and even after doing so, i had 2 unraveled threads resulting in large holes. unfortunate since it was so flattering before washing."
1,Comfy and warm These are fabulous leggings for cold days. i am a teacher who has to do crossing guard duty in the mornings and finally i have something stylish that also keeps me warm! love them and i highly recommend. only con is that they are about 1/2 of an inch shorter than i would like.
1," So soft, comfortable and warm! i ordered the black and think i'll buy the grey and lavender, as well. the material is a little synthetic/almost shiny looking, but definitely not a deal breaker. these are my new lounge pants. recommend!"
0,Smells awful I bought the black and gray fleece lined leggings. i thought the price was great. too good to be true. you get what you pay for. once i opened the box they smelled awful. it was a chemical smell. i washed the black pair twice and it was a little better. i have washed the gray 5 times and it still smells.
0,"Not for my hips I'm 140 at 5' 8"". pear shape. the pockets really opened up when i put them on and didn't lay flat. loose on leg opening - which i liked. but the pockets sticking out around the hip area made my pear shape even wider. i got a medium"
1, I get so many compliments when i wear this... colors are great and print is unique. perfect for fall.
1,Very flattering This dress fits to a t! true to size. very flattering. fabric is soft and comfortable.
1,"Awesome dress This dress is absolutely gorgeous. every time i wear it, people just don't stop admiring it. great material and great fit."
1,"Interesting Love the block appearance. looks exactly like on the model ! material again could have been better. dry clean only, so expensive wear. price per wear may be high due to that as each time you dry clean price actually goes up and use goes down."
1,"Different but didn't work out This is a cute jacket, nice materials, comfortable, and feels very well made. i read some reviews about sizing and went with a small when i am usually an xs or s. the small was too big and boxy feeling, i think i would have liked it better if it felt like a more tailored fit. the design is definitely different and i played around with the collar drape thing but it felt a little awkward to me. overall, i think it's a cute jacket, but i sent it back, not for me."
0,Odd fit I couldn't even figure out how to wear this sweater the fit was so odd. the arms cut off short and the seams don't hit your shoulders where they should. all the extra fabric around the collar is just confusing and unflattering. moving around in it was not easy. i will return this one!
1, The top red is more like orange. was disappointed and returned it
1,"Beautiful I loved this top but it runs small so i had to send it back, unfortunately.
beautiful styling and color blocking. just wish there had been a larger size available to have been able to exchange for."
1,"Versitle sweater Light but cozy enveloping sweater. i've worn this with an evening outfit, as well as to a preschooler's birthday party. it is an odd cut, but now that i have figured it out it is an easy piece to throw on and look put together. tons of compliments every time i wear it. it is quite long (i'm 5'4""), so it would work for someone taller, too."
1,"Super soft, comfortable I'm a 34c and 136 lbs. i bought this jacket in m and it fits perfect! the sleeves are just the right length, it fits through the chest and hips. the leather and other material is super soft! i love the dark brown color, it's just as pictured. like someone else said, you can tuck the hanging material inside the jacket for a sleeker look. this is my new favorite jacket!"
1,In love with this dress I am in love with this dress. ordered online in both my usual 4 and 6 (i go back and forth) and this time i kept the six. there is a little bit of stretch to the fabric but it has nice structure and the cap sleeves make it a welcome addition to my wardrobe. i plan on wearing this as a day-to-night dress since it's appropriate for work and for an evening out.
1,"Beautiful This jacket is stunning. the vegan leather has a slight shimmer. the waterfall fabric is nice and soft. it's really beautiful and unique. cropped jackets tend to shorten me, but the cascading waterfall fabric add a nice little bit of length that just balances the jacket nicely. the sleeves in the xxsp petite size that i tried on were tight. they were better in the xsp but i won't be wearing any thick sweaters underneath. it fit everywhere else. i'm usually an xxsp, and sized up for the arms. ove"
0,"Very low cut...and a weird snap Love tiny. i am 5'7"", 125-128 lbs depending on the day, and a 34a. i also have a very long torso, and tiny shirts are one of the few brands that are usually long enough for me. this one, however, was a huge miss. i ordered online in my usual tiny xs. it was much too big around and felt shorter in the front than stated, so it looked boxy on me. however, the worst part was the placket. the description doesn't note that it's held together with a tiny snap. that snap takes nothing to undo, and then"
1,"Pretty but awkward I buy pretty much every tiny top retailer carries and so of course i grabbed this one online. i would say size wise it's consistent for tiny, which in my opinion is in the ""runs small"" category as i'm a large in basically every top ever except the tiiny brand where i always have to take an xl. anyway, the print is beautiful but the neckline is strange- there is a very flimsy button keeping it tacked shut at the very top, and if that snap pops open it's open all the way down to the waist area where"
1,"Beautiful jacket This jacket is phenomenal. the color is gorgeous in person. the brown has a unique shimmer to it that just makes it feminine and special. it's also very warm and comfortable. like some other reviewers said, it looked great zipped as well as unzipped. this is a really special find and great addition! if you're considering this jacket i say go for it. for reference, i actually love the fit and thought it was tts, though i am a 32c and got this in a small so perhaps that's only the case for c cup a"
1,Hooray...it came in a petite! Was so excited to see that this colorful top came in petite sizes! it fits perfectly and so happy that it doesn't fall too long. looks great with a longer cardigan sweater. very happy with this find .
0, Loved the look of the sweater and the the fit was as shown.  however this is a thin cashmere for the price.  returned.
1,"Great summer dress I love the colors and pattern on this dress, and it's nice that it has a lining so no slip needed.  the cut works perfectly for my big booty figure however, i'm pretty small up top, and the neckline comes pretty low, so i either have to wear my craziest push-up bra, or get the top altered. i haven't decided what my plan is yet, but will keep the dress for sure."
1,"Cute summer dress I purchased this dress in the blue version. its a lovely dress that would be perfect for summer. the dress fit tts on me .. it is a little low in the neck area and it is a little uncomfortable in the torso area. i am on the fence about keeping it. the skirt is flouncy, cute and fun. i hope i can get it to work"
1,"Color! Beautiful color; however, the fabric did not work for me. tight on top, large on bottom."
1,"Beautiful Love, love this top. fabric is nice and soft, looks great with leggings. love the way it falls in the front an long enough in the back."
1,"Dress is super flattering 5'6 149lbs 34d normally size 6

i picked this up on a whim to try on and i am glad i did. it is very flattering on my curvy frame. it does run a big big so i sized down to a 4 instead of my normal size 6. the top is still a tad bit big as another commented- not enough that i would need to have it altered but enough that i probably wouldn't wear it to work without a cami under it. over all i love this dress. its very flattering and flirty and it makes me feel pretty! i bought the orange motif"
1,"Lovely Love the skirt, colors are nice, fabric is thick enough to go to fall, but not too thick for summer (ti is short, so has room). the colors are somewhat ""brighter"" in person, but not summer bright, more fall bright, not sure htat makes sense). love the flower pattern, it is pretty but strong at the same time.

now on to fit: the waist is the small part. my usual 0 was snug on the waist, but the skirt was perfect everywhere else. not sure about sizing up yet, as it may flare out too much, will g"
1,"Love this! I love this tank. super soft and comfy. i wear with leggings, jeans, shorts- anything. longer in the back so will cover your butt- at least it covered mine. runs slightly oversized. love the asymmetry in the front- very flattering. very happy with it."
1,"Missed the mark for me Online this dress looks so perfect, but in person it's a bit dowdy and unflattering, at least on me. i'm a size 4 with curves, and i was hoping it would enhance my waist and flatter my figure. but, sadly, it was too large on the waist and too poofy in the skirt, so it just did nothing for me. i considered sizing down to a 2 so that the waist would fit, but the skirt still has too much fabric, making my hips look large. so much potential, but missed the mark for me."
1,"Slight oddity but otherwise quite pretty... I ordered a size 6 and an 8 based on the review that said that the piece ran small. i fit both skirts but chose the size 8 as it was a bit looser at the hip and the length was better. funny though-the pockets on both skirts were sewn at very uneven areas on both. neither skirt had usable pockets as they were sewn shut at half inch intervals on one skirt (6), and very uneven intervals on the other (8). i liked the idea of pockets which is one reason i ordered it-it is described as having side poc"
0,"Wish it was as pictured It looks adorable in the picture... but just not flattering in real life. too much fabric in the skirt that flares from the waist in a bunchy, unflattering way. makes a slender but curvy figure look boxy, rather than enhancing curves. it's a pass. love the blue print, though."
1,"Comfy and not binding I am 5' 5"" 150 lb and i usually wear a 10 or 12 in tops because i don't like clothing too tight on top. i took a chance and got the xl because it was all that remained. now i wish i could be more! please bring this back retailer!"
0,"Hole in it after a month I have had this shirt for a little over a month. i've wore it maybe 3-5 times and there is a small hole in the middle of the sleeve on my shoulder. it's not even on a seam, so i can't fix it. i expect much better quality from retailer. don't buy this. the quality is very disappointing. which is really unfortunate because this is a very nice fitting shirt and goes well with pencil skirts."
1, I saw this dress in the store window and gave it a try. i found it to be super flattering and feminine. the bodice is form fitting and the skirt flares out to a full skirt. the colors are fun and vibrant. the neckline is a bit low for work but perfect for evening. it is true to size.
1,"I really wanted to like this top Some quick notes- it is not sheer, like a previous poster was asking. there is a lining. the color is darker than it appears online, which was ok with me. i thought it still looked nice as a deeper gold. i was excited about this top, and thought it was the perfect thing for a casual/festive company holiday party. i ordered a m, and am usually between m and s in most retailer items. unfortunately it fit me rather boxy and short. i have a larger bust (30g) and it draped in a very unflattering way. m"
1,"Love this dress! I bought this dress in the orange and it is great for summer. even though i am normally a small/size 4 at 5'5"" & 118 lbs, i opted for the 6 because i am busty (34d). this was the right call. the dress is comfortable, flattering and i got lots of compliments. it's a keeper!"
0,"Thin layering turtleneck I ordered this turtleneck in white and was very surprised to find that the material is so thin and gauzy it's sheer. i will definitely have to wear a white camisole under this every time i wear it, even when using it as a layering piece. it seems to run true to size if not a little small. the neck is interesting because it is so light and floppy...you can adjust several ways. it doesn't hold form well, though. i will most likely keep it but will never wear it without something both under and ove"
0,"Missed the mark Oh boy...i didn't get this one, and it runs small. too bad."
1,Awesome fit The dress has an awesome fit and the perfect length. it's easy to make it more classy with a summer cardigan.
1,"Pretty bathing suit Cute bright colored suit a little more orange than pink i prefer pink but the fit didn't quite work for me 

 the bottoms were a little too big and the top although was fairly well proportioned just didn't look right altogether 

 purchase the extra smalls in both  and have since returned 

 i do love the suits that retailer has been offering would just love to be able to try them on in the store
 nice quality good colors"
1,"Super comfortable and cute I didn't notice what some of the other reviews have said. i think it's very flattering, makes my waist look tiny and the flouncy skirt is a lot of fun. it is low cut in the bust, but not crazy. i'm a modest person and i'm comfortable with it. what i like best however it the cut of the top. it is wide enough at the arms to cover any armpit bulge! the fabric is very light and soft and the colors are vibrant and fun. it does run a tad large. i can go between a 2 and 4 in most retailer dresses and got"
1,Butter soft and beautiful color! As soon as i saw this skirt i was in love. i like the fit it is very comfortable. i love the detail in the crocheted part of the skirt. i can't wait to wear it and i recommend this item.
1,"Runs very large Love this dress! sadly, it ran so large that it was literally falling off of me. because i bought it on sale, the option wasn't there to buy a smaller one. the quality is excellent and it's perfect for a spring or summer day in miami:-) sorry to have had to return it due to the sizing issue."
1,Cute top Great top for everyday wear. runs a little large as i usually for size medium and i bought a small. a tiny bit see through but i think i can get away without wearing a tank underneath.
1,"Against the majority Everyone else who reviewed felt the dress fit quite odd.  i have an oddly shaped body, so this dress was perfect on me!  the bigger bodice fit on my large broad rounded upper body, skimmed my true waist and flared out to complimentary skirt that wasn't too twee.  the silhouette evens out my odd figure.  the fabric is a gorgeous pink/orange/teal pattern on comfortable cotton.  i do have to agree with the lowness of the neckline, it's a bit immodest.  i wear my cropped denim jacket and a simple la"
0,"Alterations needed I took a risk on this dress despite the multiple reviews about the pouffy skirt and revealing neckline, because i loved the look of the blue motif print. alas, the adorable print, the handy bra-strap holders, and super-soft fabric were the only things that worked for me. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lb, small up top, not especially curvy but not straight either, and i ordered my usual 2p. yup, the pleated skirt was much too full (i felt as though i was wearing a cheerleader's skirt) and the neckline was way"
1,"Amazing! This skirt is worth every penny! it appears slightly different than pictured in terms of color -- it is a cream/blue gray making it very versatile. the crochet work is beautiful and cream. it is not too bright to show every dirt mark; the cream coordinates perfectly with the leather color. it is a classic, elegant design and could be paired with a silk type or even a cashmere sweater in the cooler months to come. for me, it is tts mostly (i am usually a 4-6) and the six fits perfectly. it has an"
1,Best tights! These are the best tights! last year i bought these and they went back to regular waistband. this year the best waistband tights are best!
1,Comfort and style The color of these shorts is even more beautiful and vibrant in real life. the detail is wonderful and they are so comfortable!
0," It is indeed cut to the shape of a trench. however, i think retailer should rename it as it's more like wearing a cardigan. it's soft and pretty which i like. however, i wasn't convinced to buy it since i have a gazillion long black cardigans already made out of the same jersey stretch material."
1,Cozy cape I saw this initially in the store and thought it was nice but did not purchase because i thought the price was too high.  i saw it again and it was on sale but the store had sold out of my size.  i checked online and my size was available so i ordered.  i was afraid this cape would be to long and make me look frumpy but it wasn't and i didn't.  it looked great. i tie the belt a little higher than the model to make me look taller.   i can't wait to wear it on cool fall days.
1,"Very nice, just as pictured This is a very lovely sweater dress, it looks just as pictured and true to size. i ordered mine online and was very happy with this purchase. the material of the top white portion is very soft and cozy and bottom peach chiffon material has sparkly stones. sweater dress is very pleasant on the skin and looks refreshing. recommend!"
0,"Scratchy I love the colors and style of this poncho, however, the fabric is a total miss.  it is so scratchy, i developed a serious rash within the first 1/2 hour of wering it. also, unfortunately, the fabric is not woven tightly, so the poncho does not keep you warm, the wind whips right through it. it is disappointing that while the styles of retailer have remained top, the quality of their clothing has steadly gone down the hill. i hope retailer will put more effort in bringing the quality back."
0," This blouse is stunning on the website ;however, it is totally sheer which you cannot tell from the photo. i was very disappointed and will be returning."
1,"Love, but zipper broke 1st wear Everything about this jumper is lovely- the color, the fit, the fabric. corduroy anything rules. but the first day i wore it the zipper was a problem. it was missing a tooth. my husband helped me work around that to zip it up for a sunday drive. i unzipped to nurse our baby and then we couldn't get it back up and it just separated leaving me half dressed in the restaurant. was going to have it repaired but will send back now that i see they have more. i don't know about y'all but i always feel a"
1, Very comfortable and love the color. i'm a bit curvier on the bottom and the small still fit me fine.
1,"Comfortable This will be my third pair of hei hei shorts.  i was very pleased with the previous two shorts, sand city short and dobby beach comber.  all shorts have nice materials and not too tight, perfect for the summer.  i typically wear s or m depending with the material and design.  i bought size s and it fits nicely."
1,The perfect jeans! The jeans are the perfect high-waisted jeans. they do not stretch out and fit perfectly. the perfect length for a heel. love them all year round.
0,"Not for the busty This was very tight in the bust in my typical size. it fit more or less everywhere else, but the material has no give. so unless you are the precise measurements of the dress, this will be a hard dress to wear.
the color is really lovely though!"
1,"Beautiful, retailer at it's best! When i saw this sweater online i ordered literally immediately as i was afraid that is would sell withing an hour!
i am shocked that it is not sold out!
when i received it in the mail it is even prettier in person.
the ""pink"" tulle peplum is actually more of a taupe giving the sweater a more sophisticated look.
the sweater is soft and cozy and the peplum is such a beautiful and elegant touch.
i wore with silver flats and jeans and wow, got so many compliments!
runs spot on true to size and is a"
1,"Perfect fall sweater I got this in the grey and wore it the day i opened the package. one side is see through, so i wore a camisole underneath. it's lightweight and not at all clingy. i normally like my shirts in medium and this was true to size for me. perfect sweater for a fall day in new england."
1,"Love! I've been trying to find a pair of tasteful destroyed jeans for the summer. i'm also petite. i love paige jeans already, since the ankle length has worked very well on me. i saw these jeans in store, tried them on, and loved them. like other paige jeans they don't stretch out (especially if you size down - but even then, you don't get that ""sausage"" feeling of wearing pants that are too small - the material stretches in the waste)."
1,"Yes! Love these! i am a medium in shorts or 29-30, and the medium fit perfectly.. true to size, very soft, flattering cut and color. love the embroidery. great for travel, very light and can be jazzed up a little with nice sandals, almost like a flirty little short skirt. the fullness and non fitted look is great for a less than perfect tummy.
i am very happy with this purchase."
1,"Fun & easy shorts! Really cute and comfortable. i have worn these a couple of times and get several compliments! worth every penny, and now they are on sale!"
1,"Great quality, unique piece I am 5'3"", 130b, small waist, wide hips. dress fits perfectly, a little longer than i had expected (hits about mid-calf on me). great quality corduroy, nice medium green color. very unique, sort of vintage feel piece."
1,First fall favorite This poncho is dreamy. the colors are divine and appear a little bolder in person. there is a gorgeous leather trim around the edges that elevates the look so much. the belt minimizes how big the poncho is and really makes it feminine. its everything you dream of when it comes to a third layer for fall. my only gripe is that the fabric is a little itchy. it being wool i can't say that i'm surprised and the truth is that its heavy enough that you would definitely be wearing long sleeves underneat
0,"Too much fabric, makes you look larger I loved this dress when i saw it online, perfect for a summer wedding, but when i tried it on i was very disappointed. the fabric and styling are gorgeous and very high quality but the sheer amount of fabric on this dress is just not as pictured. there is layer after layer of silk and ruffle and while lovely, it made me look very large. i tried tying the belt many ways to no avail. sadly, it will have to go back. it may look good on a very thin frame but didn't complement my average one."
0,"Average overall First off, this shirt is a hd in paris brand, not floreat. i love floreat clothing so that is why i initially bought this blouse. i like the idea and the coloring of the shirt. the biggest drawback for me was that it is completely see through. i just bring myself to get a strapless cami just to wear this one top. please change brand name."
1,"An elegant sweater for all occasions Unlike one comment below a review on here who stated it felt childish, i didn't feel this way at all. i'm a sucker for anything white with tulle and soft colors and a bit of bling :) here's my thoughts:
-------------------------
pros:
- very soft with good amount of stretch.
- tulle bottom is exactly as pictured. i disagree with another reviewer who said the color was more of taupe; it is not. this is pink/nude shade all the way.
- runs tts. i'm a 36c, hourglass, 5'9"" and found the medium to be"
0,"Quality is just not there... I had such high hopes for this blouse, as it looks totally stunning online. however, it's not as pictured/described in that it is totally sheer and the brand is not floreat, but rather hd in paris. for the price, the quality is just not there...i've seen comparable shirts at other stores for much less. i returned it without a second thought."
1,"Adorable shorts These shorts are great for warm weather. they look great with a navy top. the pattern is very attractive. they are on the baggy side, but the style is very flattering."
1," Love the interesting patterns and slightly oversized fit.  perfect for a relaxed day with a cami, skinnies and sneakers.  what i don't like is the materials used to make this sweater.  i'm concerned laundering will shrink and i will lose the drape or it will be too short.  the perforated part is truly see through, so yes wear an under or over layer."
1,"Perfect winter dress I love the texture and sheen of corduroy combined with this beautiful evergreen color. i purchased size 10 and the somewhat stretchy fit accommodates my bust size (36dd) with a blouse or slim fitting sweater quite well. i think the skirt flares out too much and ends a little too low for my height, so i'm waiting for the petite to arrive to see if it's more flattering. i picked tts but may be a bit large for those who are less busty, so you may want to size down if you're slender or pear shaped."
1,Unique sweater I tried it in the store but was not the true size so i ordered online. i wore it only once so far and got lots of compliments. very unique design.
1,"Great poncho! Really unique & will easily go with many tops/bottoms. i agree with the other reviewers, it's itchy, but so super cute. the sale price is a good deal. i had already planned to wear with long sleeves so the itchy fabric should not be a problem. i got the xs/s, my usual size."
1,"Gorgeous and warm This is so much nicer in person! wore this out today...now that it isn't too too cold. fashionable and warm. love the clasp. quite genius! i am a 36c and while i'd normally take a small, got this in medium and it fits perfectly. i'd say this piece runs slightly small for retailer."
1,"Beautiful I loved this dress. i'm 5'6"" and wore the small and even in heels it was a bit long. i have a larger chest (double d) and the chest was slightly snug but otherwise fit perfectly.  i got compliments from everyone, gorgeous dress."
1,Great pattern Simple pull-on pant with a great design. they look flattering on and can easily be dressed up. i wear between a 4 and 6 and the small fit perfect. i have washed them and worn them several times and they still seem good as new. the wide elastic waistband ensures that they stay in place.
1,"Holy smokes!! This dress is incredible! let me say that when it first arrived, i was terrified that i looked like a got tangled in my grandma's curtain. the print was really overwhelming for my living room. however, i went with my gut and wore this dress for our engagement photos out in the woods. not only was in incredibly flattering, it photographed better than i could have imagined. wouldn't recommend wearing this grocery shopping but this is a perfect for a special occasion!"
1,"Couldn't resist I tried this on, left, went back, put it on hold, then finally took the plunge. i had a hard time justifying the price. not really a functional coat, too warm to be a shirt. but so unique, i had to have it!! i got the s/m. boxy, in a good way. got it yesterday with the antro members 20% off."
1,"Sparkles! I love this shimmer tank-in both colors! it is a very thin fabric-thinner than i would have expected, but i think this is okay since i would use it for layering and probably never wear it as a standalone tank. i think you can never go wrong with sparkles, especially in a layering tank-it dresses up or fancies up the outfit. the straps on this tank are not adjustable, and if you are large chested, i think a lot of cleavage would show in this tank. i would have preferred the sleeves are very sligh"
1,Love this skort! I was hesitant to buy this due to the price but so i glad i did when it came in the mail. great quality and surprisingly thick silky fabric. very comfortable and the shimmery thread detail is beautiful. could be very warm in the summer due to the thick tweed like fabric. fits and looks true to size just like it does on the model.
1,"Lovely top I adore this top. lovely color, fit is very flattering. can dress up for work with a skirt, or down with jeans."
1,Floral delight I purchased this in both colors the neutral and grey. i love them both but the grey is by far my fave. this is a nice soft beautiful tee. the burst of flowers are just adorable. i found these ran tts on me. cute little top and such a good deal at sale price.
1,"Great piece for petites Nice quality fabric that's soft to the touch, lightweight, and lays smoothly. runs small - great for those of us who are small on top! the s fits like xs. longer length but not tunic length. the navy can pass for dark silver-gray."
1,Pretty top I like that the top is lightweight and very comfortable and is flattering. i can see wearing this over the holidays for entertaining. it looks festive and pretty - something easy to pop on and look pulled together in a flash.
1,"Tall bettys rejoice, this maxi is for you! Vibrant, lovely and quite long! this maxi works for leggy bettys - i stand 5'11"" in my stocking feet, and the dress hem grazed the floor. not quite as voluminous as the photo suggests, but stunning nonetheless. runs a bit small. i normally wear xs to s, and i tried a xs in-store, but it fit just ever-so-slightly too snug. i didn't try a size s, but i suspect it may have fit ever-so-slightly too large."
1,"A piece that stands out I like the idea of a skort, and how it is different than everything else out there. this skort is a bit dressy--perfect for a summer party or drinks on the patio at a city cafe. i love that it has pockets. the fabrics used in the patchwork are quality and the tailoring is nice. it fit me true to size. i can't wait for warmer weather to wear it!"
1,"Stunning and sensational In love with this dress! so feminine and lovely. makes you feel beautiful. the fabric, flow, and construction of this dress is stunning and flattering. i am 5ft2in and 114 lbs...bought the xs and it fit perfectly in the waist but is a bit snug in my not so large bust area.  however, the s was too large and did nothing to accentuate my waist and changed the whole look of the dress on me. cannot wait to wear this dress, but it is so long &needs to be altered. itll be worth it!"
1, Cute summer/vacation dress. lightweight material but not flimsy. i'm normally a xs/s and i ordered the s petite which was right b/c i think the xs would have been too clingy looking. the regular length would also have been too long.
1,Cute top; somewhat sheer Cute top; somewhat sheer but color and fit are great. fits slim but true to size.
1,"Great, versatile and comfy These pants are wonderful. they are very flattering, the color is gorgeous, and they are incredibly comfortable. got tons of complements!"
0,This dress is all polyester! beware! I got fooled by this dress's description. it's 100% polyester and not wool as it claims to be! looks cheap.returned it!
1,Another perfect tee for atlanta's hot weather! Gorgeous soft colors that can be worn with many things. lightweight fabric with beautiful detailed finish to the neckline. i purchased at my local retailer store along with the baroque tee (that i purchased in a smaller size because of the differences in the design of the two shirts). highly recommend both!
1,Lovely This top is perfectly feminine. the fabric is light and the bow adds that perfect touch of distinction.
1,"Adorable This seems like a simple tank, but the shape of it is super flattering. it kind of soles in at the seam, and the shoulders are just adorable and sexy at the same time. i love the detail in the straps, coloring is neutral enough, adn the fabric is very soft... i am glad i finally tried it on, jsut didn't want t pay full price, but broke down as sizes are selling out (smaller sizes, i am usually xs petite and that is gone, so is xxs, so went with xs). i am 115 lbs and 30dd for reference..."
1,"Nice and comfortable Flattering cut, the tie neck is very nice, but definitely needed the petite for me, regualr size went too low. the striping is a nice flowey thin fabric in grey and navy, with a bit of texture in ti, not sure it is obvious from the picture. length in eptite went right below my knee, but in a goood spot. overall, loved it, but returned in hopes it hits sales one day (jsut spending too much latetly)..."
1,"Stunning dress The dress is gorgeous, material is soft, great design! but runs at least one size small and very long. i'm 5'3 and even with 4 in heels it's way to long. alteration needed"
1,Just order it.... Far more attractive in person than online. earlier reviews are all accurate. very flattering and quality manufacturing. the scarf bow makes it so distinctive.
1,"Appreciate the simple, high neck. Beautiful tee and cut with a classic, simple silhouette. nice weight and true to size. i'm 5'7"", 132# and the small fits me like i like. not tight at all, with room to allow for shrinkage. i really appreciate the higher cut of the neck as most tees i have purchased last several years i love for the overall fit and material but am a little self-conscious in due to the low cut neck. maybe if i weren't as small chested this wouldn't be an issue for me. i definitely recommend this tee."
1,"Cozy boho chic This is just a really fun jacket. agreed with the previous reviewer that it's not the most functional. but guess what -- this is super cozy (it's lined with the softest faux fur), it's quilted in an army green, and it has the best trim along the arm. they could've cut corners on the quality here, for instance, with the beading or the material on the trim. however, they didn't cut those corners. instead, the jacket feels incredibly well made and feels very expensive. can't wait till the weather g"
0,"Constantly needs adjusting I wanted to love this dress, and i don't. it is soft, it is flattering on the model, and sits comfortably on the shoulders... until you move. the heaviness of the shoulders pulls the fabric back, causing the drape along the bottom to look odd, and unflattering. so sad- i wore it to lunch with my husband, but felt like i was constantly pulling the shoulders/sleeves back into place... i won't pull it from my closet to wear again, very often."
1,Beautiful details I wanted to love this but my hips interfered. it is a little on the short side also as one previous reviewer noted and is definitely made for a straight figure. beautiful details on the shoulder and could definitely see this as a staple in my closet if the fit was right. sadly it was returned!
1,"Great colors I cannot believe this t-shirt is on sale! the colors and the design are beautiful and soft. the shirt is an average t-shirt weight, and the fit is nice and loose on the body like it is on the models. i am 5'3"" with a petite/athletic build and the xs fits comfortably (with some room...washing may make it even more perfect). i cannot wait to wear this with jeans on the weekends or with a grey skirt to work."
1,"Easy machine washable dress I really try to avoid hand washing so i immediately checked the label when i found this dress in-store. and despite the fact that retailer lists this as hand wash online, the label says machine wash. (it also says lay flat to dry.) so i was happy about that. i tried this in xs regular (first photo with camisole) which was too low-cut and then ordered the xspetite in the second photo (i'm a 34aa, ~105 lbs.) which was better; higher v-neck mainly and shorter length, although i could've gone with eit"
1,"Very slim The dress is beautiful! it is very long, romantic, and feminine. i am 5'10"" and it touches the ground. i tried on an xl, (normally i am a l and today i wore a size m retailer dress to work) and i could not even begin to zip the xl dress. the arms were fine. i think i would need 2-3 sizes higher. i am so sad because it is so beautiful."
1,"Just don't wash it I loved this dress...until i washed it. the label says machine wash cold and lay flat to dry...which i did (washed on delicate). now it's not the same dress. it's too short and not as soft and i feel so much differently about it. i wish the label would just instruct to dry clean, i would pay the extra expense to still have the dress i loved. just kind of annoyed. so it's an awesome dress, just be prepared to dry clean it or risk shrinkage if you wash it."
1, These are so comfortable! i love how they fit snug but have tons of stretch..this is my second pair of fleetwood from coh. love this style
1,"Great tee What a fabulous find! i purchased the grey and it looks great with different shades of blue jeans. i am 5'9"" 136lbs and wear a size 6..... 34 c and the medium fits wonderful. was worried it would run short, as i am long waisted, but fits just a bit shorted then pictured. i love tucking the front in and letting the back hang out."
1,"Fun floral tee I tried the gray pattern on in the store and it is very soft and pretty. the fabric has a nice drape to it. however the length was too long on me, so i came online to find it in petite, but most of the petite sizes are sold out in the gray. i shop at retailer because i like it that so many of their styles are available in petite, however the petite length sizes seem to sell out much faster than the regular sizes. i hope retailer will give us short girls a break and order more petite length sizes so"
1," Very cute skort that fits tts. great length for us middle aged women as well! love the hidden front pockets and the modern color block design. my only issue is the side zipper gets stuck right where the waistband starts. i'm assuming this is because of the thicker fabric around the waistband. i usually try to wait for the sale prices, but i think this skort will sell out well before then."
0,"Petites beware I'm 5'2-5'3 which is supposed to be the max height for pieties in retailer (former employee) and while the bodice hit right, the skirt was insanely long. not even with heels is this gonna be right. and no discount towards hemming? i'll wait until this hits the sale rack, which it will because concensus is, it's way too long."
1,"Summer's around the corner! Was actually looking for something completely different and then walked into this dress. i have already a few events lining up for the summer months, and i could see this working on those hot summer days. i'm short and curvy so i tried on the large in store (i'm busty) and ended up ordering the petite l online. the top part fits proportion wise better with petite while a l gives my larger bust size enough room. i love the 3/4 length, i feel a great length when you're only 5'1, will look great wi"
0," Gorgeous, but the trim detail on both in-store coats was already trashed and falling apart. for $218 and it can't even make it out of the store intact? i love the look but didn't want it to fall apart. they should've done an extra reinforcing stitch on the trim. such a shame!!"
1,Beautiful tee I love this tee so much i bought in every color available. i have received so many compliments on each one! so soft and comfortable and easy care.
1,"Adorable and hard working piece! I love this piece and have bought it for three different clients as well as myself... it runs a size larger - i am usually a 4 and the 2 fits perfectly. the skort was one size off for my clients too. definitely a great choice for spring/summer, especially if you love to dress up but lead an active lifestyle!"
0,Long in front {short in back} It's the inverted invert ... not so obvious at first but then it shrunk and was harder to ingnore.
1,"Just perfect Love the dress. it's beautiful and flowy and makes you feel like a princess when you wear it. also very versatile, as it can be worn in multiple seasons and dressed up or dressed down. love everything about the dress and know that it will become a staple in my closet. runs true to size- xs = 0/2 and s = 2/4. if you are short, be prepared to have the hem taken up. 

worth the buy!"
1,"Beautiful dress I ordered this dress for my engagement photos and i am so excited to wear it! it's a gorgeous dress, a bit fancy. it drapes so nicely on the body. as previous reviews have stated, it's a little snug in the chest and shoulders so you might want to size up. i typically wear a size 4 in dresses and fairly small chested, and i decided to stick with the small in this dress. i probably would have been a little more comfortable in a medium as it's a little tight in the shoulder area still. overall thou"
1,"Excellent staple tee I love this top! i purchased the gray simply because i felt it would go with more. i can pair it with blue jeans, my pink pilcro chinos, and even my turquoise pilcro shorts. i love that this tee doesn't have the rolled sleeves, so it's a little more finished looking. i tried on both the small and medium and both fit, but i preferred the tapered fit of the small and ultimately went with that. for reference, i'm 5'8"", 140 lbs, 32d chest. i do think $58 is hefty for a t-shirt, so you could roll the"
1,"Perfect event dress, runs small ! Love this dress so so much! the wearability of it isn't much since it's such a ""wow!"" dress, but if you have a wedding that it would be fitting for, itso perfect. if it were a touch shorter i'd be happy wearing it to the park. i'd suggest hemming if you want to make it more casual buy why go there when it's so stunning long. the sales associates in store kept telling me i looked like a princess ( although that may have been my doing as i kept twirling for them saying "" look how cool this is!"") ."
1,Love it! I would absolutely recommend this dress if you have the right body type.
1,Fun dress I love this dress! it is so much fun to wear to the beach or out to lunch! the arm holes are a little large so i wear s tank underneath!
1,"Soft floral tee Super soft, cap sleeves, shirt tail hem and double stitched seams. mine is the grey/green motif and tts. i bought (s) 34-b and the fit was perfect. the tee can transition into fall as i feel it has a more fall appeal over summer because of the grey/green motif. the blue/pink motif feels more like summer."
1,"Lovely t-shirt! This is a very lovely t-shirt, because of the color and design. it has a very nice shape as well as the sides are not just straight across. it's perfect for leaving it untucked. the petite fits really well, no too long or too short! my only complaint is the the material, while really soft is also quite thin so i'm not sure how durable it is."
1,"Cute and flattering top! I liked the idea of the scarf tie, so i tried on this top in the store. it was so cute on, that i ignored that it was a bit overpriced for the quality. the material is more of a t-shirt with elastic at the bottom, so it poofs a bit rather than laying flat. i'm not sure how durable the fabric is. it's still really flattering and the scarf color adds a bit of a pop to the navy color. i think ti would look great with jeans but, with the right pants, i could dress it up a bit and wear it to work. it"
1,"Sparkly! I was hesitant to purchase since this price is expensive for a tank, but the quality and true shimmery-ness are worth it. it fits very well and goes with many different sweaters. very happy with my purchase!"
1,"Gorgeous I ordered two sizes up, after reading reviews and added a belt for waist definition. it is long...i am six feet tall and it is perfect for me. this is absolutely beautiful; my husband loves the floral print, and i received countless compliments after one wear. the light, flowing material swayed and billowed in the breeze of the outdoor wedding i attended. very feminine and enjoyable to wear. pricey, but i felt i could wear spring through autumn. love! <3"
1,So cute n comfy Wore these to church and stayed cool without being scandy. i havent worn skorts since the 90s and this was such a nice return to that trend. :-)
1,"The coolest jacket This is one of those pieces that are timeless, special and absolutely stunning. the body of the jacket is quilted, very boxy, and the embroidery and beading on the jacket is what makes it absolutely gorgeous. the inside of the jacket is this super soft incredible fleecy fur. it adds to the luxury of the jacket. in regard to fit, its very boxy. if you live near an retailer i would highly recommend popping in to try it on. i personally wish it was a smudge longer, but i think the detail and style of"
1,"Flattering fit I have discovered that i'm really picky about t-shirts. it's hard to find a cute, flattering one that you can wear with whatever. this one is perfect. the neckline is different, the sleeves are short -- almost cap sleeves. it fits nicely everywhere. i am an 8/10 and the medium fit well. i love that it's a dark enough color and not sheer (why are so many of your clothes see through, retailer?!!!) , so i don't have to layer something under it just to wear it. it's thin enough that you can wear it in"
1,"Great dress I love this dress. it is so flattering and comfortable! i am petite with curves, and feel so good when wearing this. i ordered a petite small. i will have to stop myself from wearing it every day this summer."
1,"Better in person! Don't pass this one up ladies....the fabric is casual and relaxed, but the drawstring-like collar gives it class and flirt all at the same time. i paired it with a jersey mini skirt and the way the banding at the waist falls on this top made it look like one whole dress. i can wear this with cropped jeans, shorts, anything! truly a homerun. i'm 5'10"", 138lbs and small fit perfectly."
1,Vibrant colors This dress makes me feel like the princess of fall. it is very slimming. the colors are much brighter in real life. they look pastel here but are more pronounced. love this dress!
1,"I wanted it to work I ordered a medium and it fit perfectly. i am anywhere from a size 6-8. 5'9, 155lbs.
sadly, i am returning this dress because the horizontal stripes make my hips look huge."
1,"Beautiful dress! Love this dress! very flattering. material is thinner and more lightweight than i was imaging but it is great. it really does run small, like the other reviewers said -- glad i ordered one size up, fits perfectly!"
1,"Very feminine Nice t-shirt. the print is very nice and the fabric is soft and flowing. i love the baseball cut, it gives it a different look."
1,"Cute, lightweight summer top This is cuter in person than online. the scarf goes all the way around the neck and ties on the side as the halter. the whole top is soft like a t-shirt material. there is an elastic band at the bottom, but it's not too cinched so it won't cut into your waist- it just gives it a little bit of shape. it's a cute way to show off some shoulder this summer in a lightweight fabric. i'm looking forward to wearing it out at night with nice jeans or during the day outside. a good price for retailer"
0,"Too small Thought this would be great for a laid-back wedding in new mexico, but didn't fit. i am a 12-14 and the 14 barely fit my chest and arms. not flattering. material did not seem very breakthable. had to return. better luck next time."
1,"Amazing, but runs sooo small!! I  absolutely fell in love with the stress when i sought in the store. the fabric and drape of the fabric is amazing! however, it runs extremely small. i normally wear a medium and can sometimes even wear a small and dresses. i tried on the medium and the large and i could not even get them zipped all the way.  i'm so disappointed, as this is a gorgeous dress.  definitely size up at least one, maybe two sizes."
1,Comfy and flattering I love this shirt so much that i bought it in both colors. i purchased the xs regular which fit perfectly. the material is incredibly soft yet thick enough that i know it has some durability. the neckline is very flattering and comes up higher than most tees but not so high that it feels constricting. i also love that it is slightly tapered and comes in towards your waist at the sides and is slightly longer in the back. it's an absolute staple in my wardrobe now.
0,Made my stomach look fat The skirt part of the dress falls straight and accentuated my stomach. you can't really tell from the pic. but if you have even the slightest bump of a stomach the dress might make it look worse instead of better because of the way that it is cut. i'm pretty slim - 5'5'' and 114 pounds and it wasn't doing me any favors! the top of the dress is beautiful! i will exchange it for something else. i ordered it online and couldn't try it on before purchasing it.
1,"So, so cute! This dress is adorable. it's very comfortable and so flattering. the only thing is i can't understand why it is priced so high. it's a great dress, but i'm just not convinced it's the worth the price tag. i'm going to watch for it to go on sale. fingers crossed!"
1,"Great everyday tee I love the fit of this tee for everyday wear. it's forgiving on my late 30s mom body and looks much more stylish than the average tee. my only complaint is that the fabric started pilling on the second wear. otherwise the fit, style, and fabric weight are great. it fits tts. i'm usually a size 4 and the small fits perfectly."
0," Looks lovely in the picture but looks poorly made in person, runs very small. i returned it."
1," I absolutely adore this set. it's beautifully constructed-- perfect for something special but comfortable enough for everyday wear. i normally wear a 32 c but got the 34 a/b and it fits perfectly. my only complaint is that the longline portion tends to ride up and rest just below the underwire, as there is no band holding the lace in place along the bottom. still, it is far and away my favourite bra and i highly recommend it."
1,"Stunning! This dress is gorgeous. i bought it to wear to the ballet, and i know i will wear it to other formal events as well. it is really fancy---definitely wouldn't wear it to work! i had it hemmed as it was really long on me, and it is a bit tight in the shoulders. it has a beautiful shape and flows while you are walking---it felt pretty!"
1,"Stunning! A truly gorgeous dress. ran a little too small in the shoulders for me so i had to reorder the next size up. its is very long, but i won't hesitate to have it altered. it is stunning!"
1,"Really, really cute I love skorts! so when i saw this online i ordered my usual size 6. arrived today & really cute. fit is good w/ some room to spare. almost too big but i'll stick w/ the 6. looks as in the pic except the lower front part & the back has a metallic sparkly fiber in the fabric. not shown in the pic though. it's understated but attractive. the fabric patches give this skort a special uniqueness. casual or a little dressy, just love... 5'3"", 117#."
1,"I like this piece, but read on for a few notes This wears nicely, and is true to photo. flattering in the waist, and on a petite, everything fell in the right places. i also like the lightweight creppy skirt fabric. just one design note - the tie is sort of strange. essentially, there's a long tube of fabric coming out of each side of the bust - and it looks very odd when the ties are undone."
1," Love  this dress, beautiful!"
1,"Fun, unique romper I really love this piece. it's so different from anything else i own! the material has a lot of fine details to it that are hard to see in the photos. easy to dress up with a bit of jewelry and heels. the only downside is the upper body fit. i'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs with more of an hourglass shape. i did not fill out the top at all, although the shorts fit fine around my waist."
1,"Pleasantly surprised I read all the previous reviews and wasn't sure what to think. when i saw it on sale at my local retailer store, i decided that, despite the thin fabric, it was worth getting. i love the quote spoken by audrey hepburn in the movie ""sabrina"" and knew i just needed to add a cami underneath. i bought it two days ago and wore it yesterday with a short sleeved open sweater, so the quote showed. i got two compliments on it within a short time! for reference, i am 5'9"" and 150 lbs. i bought a large and i"
1,"Perfect I love this dress, saw it online and went to try it on in the store the next day. this dress is perfect! the pattern stands out but isn't too overwhelming. i'm 5'4"" 120lbs and 32ddd i bought an xs and i love the fit. it's just the right amount of fabric to be flowy without being excessive. one thing i've found with flowy dresses is they make you look preggers if you have a large bust however this dress is nothing of the sort. seriously if you find your size in stock snatch it up!"
1,"Gorgeous skirt, wow!!!!! I'd been eyeing this skirt for quite some time so when it went in sale, i took the plunge! i hover between a size 12 and 14, though lately unfortunately it's usually a 14, haha! ;) the 14 fit true to size, perfect silhouette! i will say it was more of a midi length on me than as seen on the model and i'm a near 5' 9"" so for more petite girls the length might be tricky. for me, it was fine, i liked the slightly longer length, it made it even more elegant. the quality was superb, no missing thread"
1,Adorable shorts! These shorts are so cute and comfortable! you can wear any color top and they are very flattering! they fit tts.
1,"Beautiful fabrics I fell in love with this dress as soon as i saw it. it does fit more loosely than i typically prefer, but the colors and the patterns have such personality that it didn't matter. i wear mine both as a dress and with leggings for the windy days. this is one of my new favorites!"
1, Really cute romper that can be dressed up or down. super comfortable and flattering. i ordered the xs and it fit perfect.
1,"Perfect flowy go to top For reference i am 5'7"", 145lbs, 34b normally a size m/6. i got the med and it ftt size. i ordered this online and it came a bit wrinkled so i'm hoping once i iron it out it won't be a problem when i am wearing it. i was looking for a nice flowy tunic-like shirt that was flattering but nothing too constricting. this is the perfect length for me to wear with leggings which is what i was looking for. it is longer in the back (covers my bottom) which is what i wanted and shorter in the front...the"
1,"Beautiful pattern This dress is so pretty and the petite fits great in the arms and the length is good- just above the knees. the material is nice- not flimsy. i'm just not sure if it looks right on my petite, straight frame. the front is cute but the back is pretty baggy and shapeless. i've never worn a shirt dress so i'm not sure if this is how it's supposed to look? i tried it with a belt but it doesn't seem to work with this dress as there's a band of loose elastic. probably would look better on a curvier bod"
1,"Love it! This romper is one of my favorite purchases. the material is great, the fit is very forgiving, and it is very comfortable. it is easily dressed up or down. i purchased a size smaller than i usually wear and it fits well."
0,"Didn't work for me I was excited to get this romper, but it just didn't work. i'm petite with a large bust and the blousy design of the top portion just hung like a bag on me. returned."
0,"Good for one use After washing this top pilled terribly. it is beautiful, but only for one use."
1,"Soft, long shirt that will go great with leggings I ordered the orange color online and was very happy with the product when it arrived. it's a soft orange color, perfect for fall. the shirt is thin and probably will need a cami underneath, but it's longer in the back than the front and will go great with leggings or skinny jeans."
0,Unfortunate!! I am so sad that this romper didn't work out. it's just way too billowy and huge. i am usually between a small and medium so i ordered this small. i'm petite and somewhat curvy and i was absolutely swimming in this romper! might look best on taller girls. i am 5 '2 and about 125-130 lbs and this was like wearing a tent. do not recommend. such a bummer because i was a believer after treading all of the great reviews!
1,"Adorable swing sweater The picture does not do this swing sweater any justice. first of all, the colors are much more vibrant in person than in the picture. the description says it is a ""yellow motif""; there is absolutely no yellow in it. a bit of khaki in two rows of plaid, but no yellow. the predominant colors are a rich maroon, which is so popular this season, some bright blue and salmon colors, which does not come out in the picture. rich and beautiful.

secondly, the sweater is sassy on -- just plain fun. i am"
1,"Wish this had worked out! I saw this online and loved it instantly. i happened to come by it in the store and tried it on. it was almost perfect. but sadly, being busty makes the dress hang not quite as well as it could. i think this might be a better dress for the less busty/less curvy. but it is super cute and fun!"
1,"Substantial material Very flattering on. i'm 5'4"" /145lbs and took a small. i love how substantial the fabric is and how slimming it looks on. the only weird thing for me is getting it on?you had to step thru the opening on top, there are no zippers, buttons and if you have larger hips or butt, it will be a challenge to get on. once on, it looks great and believe it or not, roomy."
1,"Favorite new fall item This sweater jacket is beautiful!  i wasn't going to try it on because i am very sensitive to fabrics that are itchy, but i am so glad i did.  it's super soft and looks great with jeans and a t-shirt.  i have a petite frame, and it doesn't look boxy at all like some swing styles tend to do.  totally recommend this one!"
1,"Flattering and comfortable I was so skeptical about ordering this; it's really not my style. i'm more of a black halter dress kind of person. this is so cute, and flattering. it's well made, not flimsy, but is soft and pretty. i'm 5'6"" and weigh 130. i bought the small and it fits perfectly; the dress hits me right above the knee in front. i can see myself wearing this with cute sandals and a floppy hat at a beach bar, or wearing it wiht6 leggings ans shooties when it's cooler and dress it up with jewelry. side note; i'm"
0,"Bigger than my first apartment I followed the other reviews and sized down. normally, i'm a small/medium in retailer (5'8""/135 for clarification) and i expected the garment to be a bit roomy. i ordered the small and when it arrived i almost called the corporate office to ensure i didn't have to pay rent on the romper, given that you could comfortably fit a small family of five in it. oddly, the arm-holes were normal sized? i returned this mess."
1,"Beautiful Absolutely love the design, fabric, and fit of this dress! a perfect dress for many occasions, one of the many reasons i love this company! excellent customer service, employees, and of course adorable clothing. 10/10 would recommend buying this dress! and to all the taller girls, i am 5'11"" and 170lbs and this dress is still a good length! no need to continuously pull down and worry about who might see your rear."
1,Perfect fit I am not a one-piece body type. this is the best best best romper i have ever tried on!! i have a large bottom and this is so forgiving due to the 1)perfect length of shorts 2) drapey fabric (not clingy) 3) asymmetrical cut of the top. highly recommend!
0,Sadly not for me! This is an adorable dress that just didn't work for me! so sad! i wanted to love it because the pattern is super cute. i gave it 4 stars because it is very pretty and i can see it working on others!
1,"My surprising find On shopping trips i try to try on at least one thing that i like but don't think will look that great on me. this dress was that item today. not only did i like it, but i liked the way it looked on me. i'm 5'3"", 140 pounds and purchased the medium. i loved it, the clerks loved it, and my very honest daughter also loved it. i will wear it as a dress and also as a tunic over skinny jeans."
1,"Buy this if you want a crop top I absolutely loved the print on this shirt, and as soon as i saw in the catalog i knew i had to have it. the velvet is beautiful and the pattern is even more rich in person. unfortunately, the shirt is very thin ? much thinner than i'd expect with velvet ? and is so short that it is more like a crop top. even with the shoulders pulled down for the off the shoulder look, the front of the shirt hit me barely below my navel. for reference, i'm only 5'1. i would buy this over again if it were only l"
1,"Love, love, love I am 5'9, very long waisted, generally a size 10-12 or med, but ordered the large to ensure it would not ride up.
(and this brand has run small in the past)
i am keeping the large but also ordering a med to compare as i have room to spare - length and width
either way, this is a keeper!!
it is adorable on, comfortable, my t-back bra works perfectly, very flattering, and way better than expected

1,"Soft light fabric This is a great summer shirt that will also transition into the fall. it is 100% rayon, so flows beautifully and feels really soft and cool against your skin. it is also washable. i think it looks much better in person than online.
i opted to have a snap added just above the top button which makes the shirt stay more closed and even-looking, as it tended to gap slightly at the top..
for reference, i am 5'5"", 125 lb., but have broad shoulders, making my usual best size a medium in most tops and"
1,"Colors are beautiful Noticed this sweater as soon as i walked in the store. i am 5'5"" 135lbs, with an athletic build so teeter between a small and medium in tops. i spent a long time trying to decide if i preferred the small or medium fit. the sweater is a bit boxy so ended up sizing up, as the longer length seems to off set some of the boxiness. i am looking forward to wearing this with skinny jeans and boots. as another reviewer suggested, i think a denim shirt will look great underneath. rated a good in quality b"
1,"Much cuter in person I bought this in-store and it is much nicer than it appears in the photos online. the fabric is soft and drapey, making the top lightweight and flowy. this is not a fitted shirt, and i didn't feel it was overly large, so i think it runs true to size. i felt fine in an xs. t did feel the need to wear a camisole/ tank with it, but i tend towards the modest side. i bought it with the wide-legged linen pants and have worn it with wedge sandals with many compliments! i wish i'd noticed the navy blue"
1,"Perfect! After having my third child, i was looking for clothes to hide my tummy. i've always loved the comfort of a romper, but the typical cinched waist was never flattering on me. this romper does not disappoint. it hides areas i want hidden, but does so with style. i get numerous compliments whenever i wear this. i cannot say enough wonderful things about this piece!"
1,Pretty skirt This skirt is beautiful- very different. it wasn't all that flattering on me due to the side pockets and back pleats- but all in all is a great skirt! i love the design and the fabric.
1,"Recommend with reservations This jumpsuit is all the things other reviewers have stated: roomy, flattering, has give. however, note: the way in and out of this outfit is a single button with a loop at the top of the back. if you need to run to the restroom - plan. it can be an absolute pain to get out of this outfit to go to the restroom. let's not talk about the possibilities of the outfit dropping on a public restroom floor...yes, i went there...

i would have preferred separates to a single piece. you could achieve th"
1,Love this dress Cute print got lots of compliments when i wore it. lightweight. looks great with boots
1,Simply beautiful! Fabulous dress for both quality and design. the embroidery is gorgeous and the long sleeves make it practical to begin wearing immediately. true to size and flattering. looks darling with booties.
1," Retailer rarely disappoints and this jumpsuit is a perfect example! i ordered a small based on reviews that it runs large and i do not like tight shorts and it was the right decision. the fabric, design and overall style make this piece easy to dress up or down. i cant wait to wear it. if you are on the fence order it now because this will not last long."
1,"Spectacular romper! Love this romper! it is beautifully made and classy. the fabric flows and the construction is soft and solid. i'm 5'5"" and 135 and the small is a little roomy but comfortably so. can't wait to where it."
1,"Ack. i want to love it... I love so much about it... it really is a gorgeous piece!  i just cannot get over the shorter sleeve... there's something about it that makes me feel like it looks as though i bought it too small, or shrunk it in the dryer =0  i'm the only one commenting on that, so it must be me. lol. i think i'm going to begrudgingly return this one :("
1,I get so many compliments I found this dress on sale in store and i usually stay away from this style/cut because i have a curvier lower half but to my surprise the dress was still flowy and fit the top nicely. i'm usually a small in tops and a 30 on bottom but it worked for me and i get a compliment every time i wear it!
0, This dress was very boxy and unflattering. i really wanted to like it because the blue and white details were so pretty but it had to go back.
1,Appealing color I've received so many complements on this top. it's so comfortable and every time i wear it someone compliments the color. i ordered it in each color!
1,"Adorable! Fell in love with this romper online, but since a few reviewers mentioned it ran large, i wanted to try it on in the store. this romper is even better in person! extremely flattering, delicate details and lined! it's adorable! i am glad i tried it on in the store. i am usually a size 6/medium, but the small worked better for me. i know this will be a staple of mine all spring and summer."
1,"Navy print shirtdress I just got this today & love it. the embroidery on the front is gorgeous & rich looking. the material is soft & has a nice weight so that it drapes perfectly & is not at all see through. it will look great with sandals, flats or sandals with heels. i wear an xs & it fits tts. it falls just above the knee. i can see me wearing this a lot. i was worried about it looking too youthfull for my age, but it doesn't at all."
1," I love this dress. the pattern is fun, the style is relaxed and breezy for spring/summer, and it is well-made. a steal at the sale price! also, it has pockets :) a huge plus for me. since it is a loose-fitting style, i would say it run just a tad big. i bought the s petite and i am 5'4"" 115lbs. i could've gone xs petite ...but the s fits well and looks great. the pattern is stunning. a great addition to my summer wardrobe. i thought about pairing it with a fitted white pant, but it hits me right"
1,"Adorable Love this dress! perfect length and i love the construction and where the seams hit (not too long, not too short). i got so many compliments with this dress!"
1,Loved this shirt - but only in navy This shirt is very flattering and drapes beautifully. i am 5'7 175 and the medium fits perfectly. i bought in navy but am disappointed in the other options - i would have bought all of them had they been nice colors but the yellow and orange are really garish and unflattering on any skin tone and the white way too see-through which ruins the visual lines of the top. bummer! but i wear the navy every day so give that a thumbs-up.
0, This dress did not work for me. it was shapeless and boxy. i tried to belt it but the white front looked odd. if you are tall and thin maybe but not for the short girls.
1,"Super cute Sometimes ""swing"" styles don't work on me - i'm on the busty side so they often make me look like i'm wearing a tent from a side view. not so this sweater. it's more of an a-line shape than a ""swing"" style and is very flattering - i would think on all body types. i love that it zips up and has pockets. the plaid is really pretty and the overstitching detail and ribbbed bottom elevate the styling. super soft too - not an itch in sight!! 
(don't know why they call this coloration ""yellow"". it's n"
1,"Nice! I threw this into my cart online on a whim, but i'm not disappointed! and i don't even wear rompers usually. for reference, i'm 5'2 and normally a size 2, and i bought this romper in a size xs petite. if you're on the shorter side, i definitely recommend buying it in the petite size, as i feel that this romper would run large in the regular sizes. the fabric of the top drapes nicely on me, and the shorts are about medium length. i like the neckline details. the armholes in the petite size aren't"
1,Pretty tunic This is a pretty tunic but it just didn't look right on me. the colors are nice and you can easily hide body flaws.
1,"Fun dress A fun dress to just throw on go, nice details in the bodice, mix of blues in the prints, little longer in back is nice detail for those of us who want a shorter dress but not the worry of flashing from behind"
1,"Flattering and easy to wear Cute design, the fabric drapes well, conceals many possible figure flaws, and has an upbeat, easy vibe. i got a small and am 125 lbs and 5'4"". i also washed it on a short cycle on cold and put it in the dryer for 5 minutes, which worked out just fine. great dress!"
1,"Wish i could love it The style and fit are excellent, doesn't make you look frumpy or larger. just can't get into the pattern combo--the white is too stark and i feel like it was slapped on my chest like a dickey. i have the paquerette and that's a mixed bag of patterns that works really well. i'm not sure if i am keeping. i may have to bleed it out to soften the white. purchased size medium for my 36dd chest and wide rib cage."
1,"Love! The print, length and cut are all flattering. i bought the other tiny dress that was similar and will buy every pattern they make."
1,"Beautiful sweater jacket I was so pleased to see this in the store, and i am glad that i had a chance to feel the knit. the combination of wool, cotton, and nylon creates a really soft, luxurious feel to the sweater. i was shocked that it didn't have cashmere in the blend, it is that soft! but, it is equally substantial. this sweater can surely be worn as a piece of outerwear, and it can be used as a layering piece. i consider this one tts because i typically wear a m in a knit that isn't fitted. i disagree with an earl"
1," This is a great, casual top that can work in all seasons. i love it with skinny pants/jeans."
0," I agree with the other review. the fabric and pattern are adorable and well made. the fabric is not sheer at all and great quality;however, the shirt is very wide. i am a 34/26/36 and the small is way too big. the arm holes are perfect but the bottom is uncomfortably large and awkward in appearance."
1,"Love Love everything about this: the length, cut, look, etc. i wear medium/large... went with medium and it was perfect."
1," Purchased this dress at the sale price, with an additional 20% off sale, not exactly sure what to expect-- the print is so different than my usual style preference. so glad i did! while the dress is way oversized (for reference, i'm 5'4, 132 lbs) ordered size sm but prob should have gone with xs) it's stylish, yet effortless. today is the first day of wear (at my office) and already received many complements."
1,"Lovely, runs looser than expected I definitely trend towards preferring my clothes looser as a style but the fit on this dress felt a bit too boxy, i typically run between and x-small and small, should have gone with the x-small. i loved the print and quality of the dress though and would recommend it!"
1,"Beautiful!!!   runs small This top is gorgeous.  i normally wear s to m depending on brand and style.  ordered a s and it was so small i returned and have l on order.  it is cropped.  i am 5'3"" and it hit me as pictured on model.  if you are tall or like longer tops this may not be for you"
1,"Great dress, good quality Love love this dress! i got the regular size, but the length is more on the petite side. it's shorter than what i'm comfortable with, so will probably return it."
1,"Pretty but big This dress is really pretty and fun. i can see where i can dress it up or tone it down. subtle pretty beading at the neck. just ran a bit big on me, i sent back for the next size down -can't wait to get it!"
0, Did not notice small hole and stain on the bottoms until i had the tags removed the return label shredded.
1,"A little big, but so comfortable! This shirt is incredibly comfortable. the material is so soft, and it fits so well. i am 5'6"" and 130 lbs with a 32b chest and i purchased a small - it is large on me, and i would have preferred an xs, but the small is just fine as well! it is a great shirt, especially for an oversized henley. 100% recommend. (one star off for the larger sizing.)"
0,"Ehhh... I liked the product shots of this cardigan, but when i opened it up out of the package i was kind of ...unimpressed... the green wasn't quite the color i was expecting, the fabric was rougher, the lace was scratchy, the fit was boxy, and the sleeves are very dolman... none of which translated through the pictures online... i still think it's cute, but it has a much more casual look to it than i was expecting. i might reconsider if it hits sale, but for now it goes back..."
1, Very cozy wrap!  the material is so soft.   find myself grabbing this anytime i am chilly day and night.  i offen find my daughter wrapped up in it too!  and with the arm holes it stays on.  very pleased.
1,"Awesome and flattering I almost walked past this until i saw it on the display mannequin. the shimmer is very subtle, but there, the picture here makes hte shirt look more like a grey shirt, but it is more ""sophisticated"" in person. very soft fabric, fitted on the ""wasit"", but romier on top, cowl is super flattering. usual sizze fit very nicely. highly recommend, i won't hev to tuck it in everytime i wear it :-# i think it can be dressed up #skirt# or down #jeans#, almost a basic t!"
1,"Nice trousers I fell in love with these trousers as soon as i saw them online. i am a big fan of essentiel antwerp, their designs are unique and bold. these trousers definitely fit their aesthetic. the print is darker compared to the picture, making the green more of a dark olive and the blue almost looks black. they have an elastic waist so that helps for some of us who have a wider bottom. they cinch back in once they are buttoned at the waist, so it doesn't make your hips look wide. the fabric is soft and"
1,"Pretty top, scratchy material I bought this in size xl and the overall fit matched the model's photos. the neckline was a bit higher than pictured. the material was pretty in person. the problem was the material's threads were too scratchy. i was uncomfortable with that scratchiness against my neck so i returned it. i did like the unique leaf pattern of the lace."
1,Very large Very pretty cardigan but it is huge! i ordered a large (normally xl or large) and it is so big! the shoulder seam comes to middle of my upper arm. i wanted to exchange it for a medium but they are out of stock. bummer.
1,"Disappointed I had high hopes for these as coh is my favorite brand of denim, and these crops were made specifically for petites. also, i was happy to see they were described as a straight jean, not a skinny. the fit and sizing seems to be a little off. i ordered my regular size in this brand, 27p, but they were too big. sized down to a 26p. they were still too large in the waist (seemed very stretchy) but fit well in the legs. i like the fact that these crops were made for petites so the length was perfect,"
1,Comfy boxy fit Very much liked this shirt for super casual days. its got a very flowy and boxy fit to it with side slits. it runs a bit big compared to what it looks like on the model.
0,I returned this. I agree that this shirt is boxy and has no shape; it doesn't look at all like it does on the model. i returned it.
1,"Runs small I'm 5'3 135lbs with hour-glassy figure and the medium was a too tight from the waste down (but perfect on the top - i'm a 36c). pretty dress overall and looks true to color in photo, but have to return."
1," These jeans are very comfortable. the distress look is enough but not too much, so it is a nice change to the traditional jeans without looking too worn down."
1,Great tunic or dress This is a great winter addition to any wardrobe. warm but not hot. looks great with tights as a dress or with leggings. so many compliments.
1,"Cute top, better for fall than summer This top is sooo cute. it does not look like pajamas as one person said, it looks like a top. it's a bit on the boxy style, so anything you want to hide below is well covered. has a nice length to it. is not just for lounging. paired it with a black pencil skirt and it looked great. i ordered the xl (i am a 40d for reference) and it hung very nicely. its extremely soft and very comfy. i only wish they had more colors."
1,"Shimmers with gold, silver, and black tones In accordance with other reviewers, the pictures don't do this gorgeous lightweight sweater justice; the fabric has threads of gold, silver, and black that together make for shimmery elegance--not at all the heather grey in the photo.. i'm 5' 8"" 120 34b and the xs (regular) fits perfect--and actually more slimming/fit than in the photo. sleeves are long--which i love. a keeper, especially on sale!"
1,"Sparkly & gold tones I didn't think from the photo online that the sweater would be quite so sparkly & gold! it has gold weaved in - so if the sparkly isn't your thing, beware. the sweater fit well although i didn't feel the neckline was quite as clean as in the photo above. also, you'd have to be careful not to snag on jewelry. it's a thin sweater material that may require a camisole underneath depending on the weather."
0,"Dolman style sleeves & scratchy lace I tried this on in store yesterday and didn't buy it due to the dolman style sleeves and the scratchy lace.  dolman sleeves look terrible on me, so this was a no go.  beware the scratchy lace...i had this on for about 2 minutes and was itching.  otherwise, this will wok for plenty of people - the color can be a nice neutral.  it does run large - i usually wear a large and sized down to a medium.  it didn't work for me, but i'm sure some will find it a nice part of their wardrobe."
0,Itchy gold metallic thread I couldn't tell on line this top has gold metallic thread running throughout. i find metallic thread to be itchy. when i first put it on i thought it might be o.k. i can tolerate a fair amount of itch in fabric. after about 5 minutes i suddently couldn't wait to get it off. seemed like the longer it was next to my skin the more irritating it became. it is also a bit thinner fabric than i expected. i was hoping to use it as a layering piece. it would work well for layering if it was comfortable.
1,"I love this! I actually like my shirt more than the other reviewers it seems. i am little (5'1"" and 103) and i don't think it's too boxy at all. i like the way it hangs. and i'll say i like it much more in person than on the model. it's somehow cozier than it looks in the picture. it's a real boosh (that mean's comfy.) i wouldn't have picked it from the online pic, but in person, it really caught my eye."
0," I was excited to see this top on sale as i had been watching it for a few weeks. unfortunately, i was very disappointed when i received it. it is, as a previous person said, very much like a pajama top. it is very loose and boxy, and in my opinion, did not flatter my shape at all. sadly, i will be returning it. i would not recommend this top to a person who is athletic, or straight and slender, as you suggest."
0,"Poor quality and unflattering This top is has an awkward neckline, doesn't lay like the photo (as mentioned by another reviewer.) see threw, and of poor quality. the fit is very baggy and unflattering. and material is very thin. it also runs very large!! the color is pretty, but that is it :("
1,"Winner! When i walked into my local retailer, two of the saleswomen were wearing this stunning top in totally different ways, and i knew it would be the perfect gift for my mom. unfortunately the small was sold out, but they were able to order it online and have it sent. gorgeous medium-to-lightweight fabric that looks great out or tucked in."
1,"Cute, unique top I purchased this in the store. i thought it was cute and unique. i like most things with a raw edge. i am 5'3"", 115 lbs and purchased an xs. i have worn it a couple of times and have received several compliments. my only complaint is that when i saw the pic online, i was annoyed. the top is much wider than the photo depicts. lying flat it measures 24"" side to side at the hem and 24-25"" from shoulder to hem. why take photos that misrepresent the item? there will only be more returns. so if you li"
1,"Big boxy fun! This top is super soft cotton, with raw edges on the sleeves and hem. i bought the green top, which is a medium, faded olive color. despite the picture, this top is shortish in the front and on the sides, which are slit. the top is also very, very boxy. it's wide across, and doesn't ""fit"" the body at all. the sleeves are a slimmer fit, which contrasts nicely with the wide body. the picture is very deceptive. that said, this top is perfect for early fall/ late summer. super comfy. floaty. i wear"
1,"Heartbroken too small! I am normally a small or xs with retailer clothing. i saw the previous review that this dress runs small, but the medium was sold out. i am heartbroken i have to return and can't get my size since they are all gone! was aiming to wear this to a high school reunion."
1,"Gorgeous dress! I fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and got it as soon as it went on sale 25% off. the colors are vibrant and the fit is perfect whether you have areas that you want to hide or not. it is true to size and i can see how you would want to size it down since it's baby doll shape, but it didn't work for me around the arm holes (and mine are not that big). i am 5'3"" and 120 lb and size 2 worked perfect."
0,"Boxy Hi, when i received this top i tried it on, looked in the mirror and packed it up for a return. the quality is excellent but it just too boxy. fits nothing like it appears on the model."
1,"Think i'll like it Pretty color.
love the lace.
my husband thought it looked a little ""old lady-ish"", but i think it depends on what you wear it with....
it's been too hot here to wear yet. i believe it will look great with a cami and leggings!"
1,"Day off henley Cute stripes and soft, but very pajama top like in feel/look... like if you wear it out, people will assume you've got the matching bottoms stuck under your pillow at home."
0,"Poor cut & quality I really wanted to love this but the cut was very wide, short, and crooked. after it was washed once, it was completely unwearable because it hung all wrong."
0,"Wanted to love I wanted to love this shirt, but was very disappointed. i had read other reviews and still ordered, but wish i would have listened. the shirt looks nothing like photos online and is extremely boxy and unflattering. had to send it back."
1,"Comfortable and versatile The color is perfect for fall.  dressy enough for work, and looks great with a pair of jeans."
0,"Terrible but had so much potential When i saw this online i immediately put it on my ""must buy"" list. i hate paying the exorbitant shipping fees retailer charges so i was waiting until i could get to my local store, in the meantime it looks like it has sold out online but i am sure it will be back in stock soon. luckily, my b&m store had it and i am so glad i didn't waste my money or time ordering it online. this could have been great but once again antho missed the mark. what the product shot online doesn't show is that it has dol"
1,"Cute top with some caveats I purchased the green online, in my usual medium. i do like it but i will be returning it for a few reasons. first, i couldn't justify the price as it's really not unique enough. it kind of reminds me of a pajama top. also, i thought it was 3/4 sleeve, which it is not, it's long sleeve. and lastly, it appears to be regular length on the model. i'm maybe 5'4 at best and it's shorter and boxy. i gave it 4 stars because i really like it for what it is, but just not what i expected. it is cute, spor"
0,First lars miss... I love every other byron lars dress i've bought and this was a no brainer for me. when it arrived i was really disappointed. the fabric is very stretchy which makes it super forgiving and very thick. with all the buttons planted on this dress i was expecting it to open easily from the front as one of my other dresses by his does. nope. only the back buttons open. thick stretchy fabric and back buttons...not an easy thing to navigate. i was also very sad to see that the length was all wrong for m
1,"Requires layering and made for the long wasted This top is so cute but after i added my tank top under neath it made me look frumpy. however, if you pair it with the right tank and bottoms it could be very cute. i think my problem is that i am not long wasted enough. i wish that it had worked because it is so unique."

0,"Cute top but looks like a tent (i'm not kidding) I love baseball style tees and when i saw the homebase tee (in two colors no less), i was very thrilled especially since it was during the 20% mother's day promotion on all items. based on the model's photos, the top looks flattering with a swing type style. i usually wear a medium and bought a small size in this top. when the package was delivered, i excitedly opened it and found two tees looking like maternity tops which would be lovely if i was pregnant. the tops are so wide not like the webs"
1,Super cute and comfortable. Great fitting and super cute!!!!! my husband said this is the cutest bathing suit i've owned!!! and i live in bathing suits!!!
0,"Disappointed I have never taken the time to write a review but i was so disappointed by this dress. the design is cute and i got the medium instead of a small (i'm normally a 4/6) and i wanted to make sure it was a bit looser and below the knee. that was a good call because the fit is comfy and cute belted. however, it is so very thin and see through. i was looking forward to a cool, cotton dress for summer but this will definitely require a full slip if i decide to keep it. it came with no slip at all so th"
1,Beautiful print and well made I love this design so much and it is very well made. i also like the adjustable shoulder straps and that the cups are not padded cups. i think that makes it look less like a bra and more like a bathing suit. only con is that it seems to run small.
0,"Not my favorite purchase I love the design of this top, however, it's quality is lackluster. the shirt is pretty short and would be more flattering (at least on me) if it had a few more inches. also it's pretty sheer, so figuring out under garments is a dilemma. i will still wear it because i love it. looks great with a denim vest over it!"
1,"Perfect denim top A beautiful classic!
love the denim fabric in such a pretty style.
this top has a more flattering fit than appears in the pics.
the fabric is soft and the fit very flattering.
ordered my usual size medium and fits perfectly........very true to size."
1,"Beautiful beautiful top! I ordered this online, with a little hesitation due to the negative reviews.
it arrived and it is beautiful!
the beading and subtle cut outs are gorgeous.
the colors of the beadwork in contrast to the nude tone of the fabric is stunning and elegant.!
the fit is very very flattering!!!!!
runs very true to size."
0,"Thin, boxy I bought this shirt after reading so many positive reviews. it looks much thinner and cheaper than the photo depicts.  like many reviewers have said, it does hit just above midriff but the fringe covers your belly.  it didn&#39;t hang right on me and i felt like i was wearing a rug."
1,"This one's a keeper Really cute top(especially the back)!  i've tried on several of these tops that overlap in the back and none of them lay as nice as this one.  the soft cotton fabric really works well with this style.  runs tts and i love that the arms are more fitted with some stretch to the fabric.  regular length works fine on my petite frame as well.  the color is a darker cream and almost has a slight nubby effect to it.  first one i received had a snag/hole in the lower sleeve, so hopefully it holds up."
0,"Cute shirt, but not cute on my figure I have more of an athletic figure, and the sleeves tend to come in closer to the body than pictured. i didn't like that cut on my arms/torso. the shirt is really cute, otherwise! i am usually a size 4/small and this was a little short and snug."
1,Simple beauty This is a tts basic tee with the added flare of the ruffled back peplum and the elegance of the beaded front neckline. the beading is lovely and mine was intact. i bought my normal small based on reviews and the fit was perfect. (34-b) the beige color is a classic neutral and can be worn year round by just adding a jacket or sweater. love it!
1,"Versatile top Bought in the store, will look great with black or dark blue jeans and a fun long necklace.  does not fit like it looks on the model, it is more fitted.  i plan on wearing a spaghetti strapped cami underneath because the back has a draping effect and is open.  the front is on the shorter side but the bottom of the shirt (not including tassels) reaches the top of my jeans, and the tassels hang below.  it is a very versatile top, one that can be dressed up or down.  sleeves above wrist."
0,"Huge I love baseball tees and this looked like a more refined version, but it was huge and shapeless.  nice material and fabric but this one is going back."
1, Very pretty top! the fabric is super soft. i ended up sizing up from my regular xs to a s because the chest area was just a bit snug.
1,Love these pants! Love these lightweight pants... they're beyond comfortable and the print is darling! hope this designer has additional pieces next season!
1," I adore this shirt. like a previous reviewer, the shirt runs a little small in the bust. i got a 6 instead of my typical 4 and it looks great. the quality is great and the color is lovely. the feel of the fabric is nice substantial weight."
0, So thin and see thru it's not even wearable in public. extremely cheap and ill fitting for any price let alone this price. i feel like they will rip the moment i wear them out. going back.
0,"Huge! Hi, i would have to agree with all of the reviewers.i unfortunately had to find out for myself. mistake. it's huge. i love the quality and design but even if you sized down two sizes it wouldn't help."
0,"Wanted to love but... I ordered this top online and was hoping to love it, however it didn't fit me properly...the arm holes were much too large (i'm typically an xs or small) i ordered the small and based on this fit i don't think the extra small would've fit either :( also i thought the material seemed very delicate and somewhat thin....and with 3 kids always hanging on me i don't think this top would last very long..."
1,Don't put it in the dryer I loved this sweater when i bought it. wore it a couple times then washed it according to the tag. it shrunk at least two sizes! and the tassels got all tangled (which i guess i should have seen coming). pretty bummed about it because this sweater looked beautiful on.
0,"Fragile fabric I love the look of this sweater, but just bought and put on at home and noticed 2 pea sized holes in fabric, near arm holes, but not on seams. not sure if i bought this way and did not notice or if fabric is just incredibly delicate. will try to repair but scated this will not hold up... look it over carefully before you buy, they kind of look like moth holes..."
1,"Very pretty The design is gorgeous and the fabric feels great. not a lot of functionality, then again i did buy the kimono to feel sexy and not to keep warm! i ordered the xsmall/small and feel i should have ordered the med/large. unless you're super tiny/fit, i'd recommend sizing up here. i bet it would still be super flattering a touch larger!"
1,"Flipping cute! This is adorable! the sweater is light-weight and soft. please know that the sweater line falls right at my mid-riff, followed by the fringe, so for me, it's almost cropped. the fringe covers my mid-riff. the back is open and so this sweater will not be super warm in the winter, but it is stylish and cute. i love it! it's different and unique. i purchased xxs in petite. fits a little more cropped than the photo shows."
1,"Like velvet! These leggings are so thick and soft! they feel like velvet on your skin. i am so, so happy with my purchase, and would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a unique, comfortable, and quality pair of leggings."
1," This button down is to die for! the material is incredibly soft and comfy. it looks great with my retailer leggings, and is also a great look with my casual denim, paired with a cardi and flats or booties. i've worn it several times for different looks and always get compliments on it! definitely a head-turning piece."
1,"Very nice, just as pictured This sweater looks just as pictured on the model. its very warm though even with cropped sleeves. i ordered a large and it was true to size but roomy. i liked this top very much but is thicker than seems. outer grey material isn't very pleasant & itchy, however the bottom portion is an underneath gown and attached to sleeves inside so its very soft on touch."
1,Quality fabric and style This has a very nice hang to it- combination of the cut and linen- like fabric. i liked it so much that i bought two different colors. so many tees are blousy and full now;i am short so they look like maternity tops. this one is much more flattering.
1," Fantastic top! fits, flatters and falls beautifully! i loved the white so much i went back for the black! i wear with jeans, leggings and with pant suits. lovely with all!"
0, What a let down. this is not what i would call a coat but a sweater. it is unlined and very lightweight. the fit was cute and would have been so great if it was actually a coat.
1,"My daughter's first job in the city! This coat is so stylish and actually reminded my daughter of the ""madeline"" stories. she just got her first paid internship in the city, so i am buying this beautiful red coat for her to celebrate. after all, a girl has to make a good first impression..."
1,"Beautiful! Ordered this coat in a small. it is meant to be a slouchy and the fit is perfect - i'm 5'5"" and weigh around 120. the sleeves are slightly longer than 3/4. the fabric is so soft, the coat is unlined and drapes beautifully. this coat reminds me of a coat my mother had when i was a child.... she referred to it as her 'car coat'... i believe that was a style then. worth the $."
0,"Tent-like but soft & comfortable I bought this in size xl. it is so much bigger than i expected. there are panels of material. it really is huge. not flattering at all. still, i kept it. the material is so soft & flowy. i've gotten good use wearing it around the house, doing chores, resting, etc. i wouldn't wear it out doing errands. but, around home, it's perfect for feeling cozy. such a strange cut. i don't know who would look good in it since it can look sloppy. i think many would enjoy wearing it at home."
0,"Too large and low quality I wanted to like this coat so bad! i loved the bright red color and design, but when i received it, it seemed very cheap and just too large. i returned it."
1,"Great basic I bought the white and olive today. i usually get a size s, but opted for the xs for this shirt. i am longer torsoed than perhaps average, so it came to just below mid-butt, which i like. my shoulders are on the broader side and a bit muscular, but even still the xs was perfect and cute, rather than just comfy. def an undershirt is needed for these, but i run cold, so i nearly always have an undershirt. the fabric is just nice enough that i could wear the shirt with a fun, nice skirt with a high"
1,Favorite tee Love this top. i have it in several colors and i'm waiting for the black to be restocked. it's somewhat sheer. perfect w my kimonos
1,Great purchase I bought this tee for a light summer top as i love linen. this top does not disappoint. i bought my usual size xs and the length is good-slightly longer in back. i purchased the black and the grey. the grey will be great with jeans in any color and the black i can wear either dressed up or down. the quality seems good. great purchase!
0,"Unlined and unshapely I have been looking for a fall/spring coat to wear when the weather is between 30 and 55 degrees. this ""coat"" looks great in the pictures, but so disappointing in reality. the best thing i can say is that the fabric is soft. it is unlined, so i'm not sure why you'd even wear it -- if the weather's warm enough to wear a thin, unlined jacket, why not just wear a sweater? the weight is not what i would expect at this price point. even worse, the design is terrible; my husband (who has a great eye)"
0,Terrible Visions of sartorial splendor danced in my head as i planned my instagram posts centered around this coat. and then it showed up on my door and my dreams were crushed. i'd already read the reviews and knew the coat was unlined and would be oversized. i did not expect it to be soooo sloppy. especially around the collar. there is nothing crisp about it. i've had boiled wool outer ware before that held its shape much better than this. if i wanted fleece i wouldn't have picked retailer as the s
1," I adore this top! i ordered in the white and wear it with everything! i am a 34c and size 6 and purchased the xs. it was slightly snug in the arms but it does stretch. i just bought the black as well, as it truly it a great staple piece. forewarning: do not dry this! my husband accidentally did and i was forced to buy another one, since it shrunk so much. the fabric is lightweight and great for summer, but keep in mind that it is thin and may require something underneath (tank top, etc.)"
1,"Easy breezy This dress was so comfortable, i wore it all day - to church, out to brunch and actually slept in it. it would travel well, too."
1,Big and boxy I bought this t-shirt in three colors and i'm keeping them because they work for what i want (travel clothes) but the t-shirts run big and are too boxy. i think they look nice if you tuck them in.
1,"Still deciding I have not a actually purchased this coat yet but was able to try it on at my local retailer. thought i'd pass along a couple of details the description is missing. the coat is not lined. i have regular length arms and the sleeves are a bit short, not quite 3/4 length but not long enough to keep my wrists warm. also, i was afraid the red would be more orange, it is a very pretty red. it also runs a little big. i am 5'4"" medium, athletic build and would probably consider a m but it seemed bi"
0,Cute but... I loved this shirt when i purchased it but it shrank badly and the front seam (on mine) was crooked. no longer have my receipt so not sure i can return it~ sigh. i do love the pilcro chinos i bought to go with it however!
1,I love this coat! fun outer layer! I love this coat! it is exactly what i was looking for. it is unlined (with cute fabric edging on the seams) and a lightweight wool but it is roomy enough for layering and that is what i like about it. also like the length as it can conceal a long tunic sweater without it hanging out the bottom. it is very versatile in that it can be worn with something dressy or jeans and leggings. also like that i can add any fun scarf to dress it up or down. it's a great contemporary shape. i would say this c
1," I echo what the other reviews say - this is a tshirt but it's very flattering. i bought the black and dressed it with a bright turquoise necklace and received a ton of compliments. extremely comfortable. i've been just looking for this shirt when i get home from work or having to do errands because it is that comfortable.

i'm buying more it's so comfortable and flattering."
1," Love this cost! runs large. usually wear a medium or large, ordered a medium and had to exchange it for a small. fits perfect now. not very heavy so don't buy if you're looking for a warm coat."
1,"Good? maybe... I love the way this coat looks in the website. it turned out to be a little different than i thought it would be. can't decide if i will keep it.
the sleeves are bracelet length, i have long arms so slightly awkward for me. i ordered the small even though i wear a medium in everything else (5'8"", 135 #). so glad i did because it is biggish on me.
it is unlined but made of a lovely, soft wool. the edges are all finished with a bias edging which is unique and well done. it is boxy, very.
lovely wo"
1,"Beautiful and very flattering I love everything about this skirt! the fabric is super comfy and it drapes wonderfully. fits great. a bit long for me as i'm 5'6 but totally worth it. i don't wear heels so i might need to alter the length, but i knew it would be long when i ordered it. i purchased the grey, but i might have to order the taupe as well!"
0,"What a mess I had my eye on this one for awhile and decided to buy it when it popped back on my wishlist. i can see why someone returned it. the sweater top hits at the worst possible spot and made me look ridiculous, like a mushroom top. from the side i saw the potential, but not enough to save it. probably one of the worst things i have ever purchased from retailer."
1,"Red simplicity I bought an extra small and i love it (i'm a size 2-4). it's warm, it's comfortable, it fits with everything, can be dressed up or down, it's not lined but it is well finished and does not feels like a sweater coat...it feels like you have a new friend..."
1,Truly unique sweater Loved this sweater when i saw it online. when it arrived it had a very strong chemical smell to it and was very stiff textured. despite the dry clean only tag i decided to soak it overnight in woolite to soften it and get rid of the smell. the next day i rinsed it in cold water and block dried it outside. it still wreaked of chemicals and took three more subsequent washings to finally get rid of the smell. hand washing did not hurt it whatsoever fyi. it looks fab with jeans and is very comfy. i
1,A coat with a great silhouette and personality I love this coat. it was a great purchase and i would reccomend it to others. it looks great with layers and is comfortable for 30-50 degree temps. definitely size down when buying.
0,"Too transparent I ordered these in m (5'8"" 140 lbs.) and they are tts: they fit well and are neither tight nor loose. the issue that i have with them (and the reason that i sent them back) is that the material, although comfortable, is completely transparent; if i were to try to run out to get the mail in these, the whole neighborhood would essentially see me bottomless! furthermore, these are not white but off-white (and quite a yellowy off-white, at that), so these loungers don't look as cute with the feature"
1,"Pretty but size down! A few things: this runs very large. i'm usually a s/m (i'm a little busty so i sometimes size up!) and i'll definitely need an xs in this, i'm swimming in the small. the blue is definitely a steel blue/grey, not really navy. the material is very thin - i thought it would be a bit more substantial. it's very lightweight. that said, it's very pretty, i love the neckline which can be worn as a cowl neck or off the shoulder, and i'll give the xs a shot instead!"
1,I don't want no scrubs... Do not under estimate the boxy shape of this it looks kind of like a hospital scrub. i think with this top the styling is key. the sleeves are long and boxy and the neckline is somewhat of an oval so for me this wasn't a top i could just throw on without doing some outfit editing.i styled this with a dark high waisted skinny jean which i tucked the shirt into and some red heels and i was ready to go. anyways the material was great it was a silk type polyester that didn't seem to be static prone
1,Pretty print The jumpsuit is very pretty but it's definitely not meant for women who are on the curvier side or shorter. plus it sort of looks like pajamas on. i am 5'7 and i wanted to to look similar to the model in the picture but it comes down to my ankles so it would look best on taller/thin woman.
1,"Perfect hot summer day choice This top is light and swingy with a bold pattern that looks even better in person. the neckline is very high, which was a surprise for a summer tank, but it's cut well. nice surprise: on seem pockets! wore it today for the first time and received many comments. a keeper. fits true to size and perfect for my petite build up top."
1,Very cute This is a great little top. colors are beautiful and more vibrant in real life. ordered size large and the fit is the same as the model. you could probably size down. armholes are a bit large but am picky about that area and i can work with it. the body flows but it's not huge and is slimming. the high neck and tie are darling. will be cute under a sweater or jacket as weather cools. good buy on sale.
0,"Short in the stride Super soft fabric, however very short in the stride. i ordered an xl, normally wear 12/14.  i had to return it."
1,"Swim Runs small in the chest, so don't order if you are large chested! over all, very cute."
1,"So much fun I love this jumpsuit. it's fun, flirty, and seems to put a smile on the faces of passersby. it works for multiple occasions/events, and is so comfortable. if daytime pajamas sounds good to you, this is your jumpsuit. dress it up with an up-do and dangly earrings, or down with slip-ons and a cardigan, i have found that i can't go wrong with it. fits me just perfectly, doesn't wrinkle too much during wear, and the adjustable shoulder ties are convenient."
0,"Fits like a giant tent The photo misrepresents how large this sweater is. it is giant! petite ladies stay away from this sweater. i ordered an xs and usually can manage to fit in a regular xs, but this just floored me. the neckline wouldn't even stay up on my upper body, it was that loose. also the width of the sweater does not at all hug the body as shows on the model. it is like a tent. i'm so bummed. the color blue is nice and the sweater is really soft. it's too bad it doesn't fit smaller women."
1,"I think pilcro are my favorite jeans. I love the serif jeans and these stet mid-rise jeans fit perfectly, too! true to size and i really like the wash. i am 5'4"" and a size 2, and the 26 fits just right. because of my height they come closer to the ankle on me than what you see on the model. i have more of an athletic build, rather than curvy."
1,"Perfect leggings Flattering fit, true to size, i ordered 31 which fit perfectly. i am 5'8"", 145 lbs. wish it came in off white,sand and black. great with boots, and more substantial than some leggings. also extremely comfy!!!"
1,Look great on my wife These look great on my wife. very versatile and go with like 80% of her wardrobe. she raves about them and they look great.
1,"Perfect for cooler weather! Love this shawl/wrap! was looking to purchase the white & warren cashmere poncho (but available online only), and then saw this in the store. tried it on and fell in love. love that it's 100% cashmere -- super soft and warm. would recommend!"
1, Very flattering ang comfy but they do run slightly big. i stayed with my true size because i am thicker in waist but if small waisted size down. fit ty's in legs and bottom. love color!
1, Great fit and extremely comfortable.
1,Embroidered masterpiece This dress is so beautifully embroidered with really cool mix of colors. it is pricey but i do think it will stand the test of time and become an retailer vintage piece. planning to wear it now with wedges and in the fall with booties and a light sweater.
1,Love these jeans! I love these jeans! i wear them all the time. i love the way they fit and the price is great. please make these exact pants in more colors!
1,"So cute! though inside not soft I got the cream color and absolutely love the style and color of this sweater. however, when i tried it on at the store, the one i tried on was super soft and comfy. i ended up finding this later on sale and ordered it online. when i got it, i don't know if it was once worn or washed by someone before, but the inside was not soft at all! i was so sad! anyone else have this experience? size is great. i ordered an xs."
1,"Gorgeous but overpriced I saw this in stores and ran right up to it because of the gorgeous embroidery work and vivid colors - unfortunately those bright colors are totally washed out in the online model pics...barely recognizable! the fabric itself is super soft and not at all stiff, plus it has pockets! i can see this looking great with leggings and boots, but the sleeves flared a little too much which i think would add bulk under a cardigan, so it might not carry as far into cooler months as i would like. my usual s"
1, I love the details that this cardigan has. try it!
1,"Pretty and feminine I tried it one bcasue it is on sale and i love it...too bad i don't need yet anothr black top. fit is loose/flowy, but the ruffles add a littl cahrm to the shirt. tried on regualr xs, i could proably go to petites though, but thankfully there is a button at the neck"
1,"Business in front; party in the back I tried this sweater on in-store in grey. from front it appears like a nice, normal sweater, even a little boring. but the side and back are *wow* really fun! the colors and swing of the back material look great, especially with jeans. the front is short, making you wonder if it's supposed to be a crop top. also, the style of the sweater lets isn't very warm because the back is so loose and flowy. i couldn't decide whether to buy it or not. maybe i will wait for a sale."
1," I have been searching for grey jeans and haven?t found anything that i truly love. i tried on both a 25p and 26p. the 25p was too tight and i don?t think they would have stretched out enough for me to be comfortable in. the 26p was close but i was afraid they would stretch out too much. they looked good from the front but did nothing for my cushion. the color, length and feel of the jeans was perfect. in the end they went back and the hunt continues for grey jeans. i would recommend trying these"
1,"Great poncho! I ordered this for the colors, and modern geometric design. colors are as shown. a beautiful combination that works well with blue jeans, and my burgundy flats. it's casual and soft enough to wear all day. i wore it to the beach, then out to dinner the same evening! oh... i spilled red wine on it at the beach, and couldn't wash it until the next day. i used dawn dish detergent and hydrogen peroxide on the spots, then laundered in the washer on hot and they came out, completely. i air dried, and"
0,"This dress is huge I saw this dress online and loved the colors and whimsical embroidery . i thought it would be the perfect dress to wear on the weekend with cute sandals. i was excited when the dress arrived in the mail as the colors were vibrant and the material was soft and cozy. unfortunately this dress is huge. it is a rectangle with pockets. i bought the xxsp, my usual size and this dress was so big my sister was able to fit in it with me.this dress was beyond alterations. too bad it was a great idea but no"
0,Weird fit This top is a good concept but the structure of it is not for all body types. i am 5.6 and 135 and wear an xs to a s in retailer tops and i ordered this is a small and it was huge in the chest and tight at my hips...will be returning.
1,Love the print Very cute print! love the mix of the colors on this sweater. looks great with jeans!! throw it on over a tshirt and you are set.
1,"Love these jeans! I normally wear a size 27, but i have a pair of shorts by same designer bought several years ago in a size 26 and so i went with a size 26 for this purchase. they fit perfectly. i would have liked to order the petite, but it did not appear to be an option. the fabric is very soft and stretchy. they are little loose around the ankle, but i have very skinny calves and ankles, so that is not so surprising. the color is a perfect grey that will go with everything. i would buy these in other colors."
1,"Not silk, but a great dress This dress is 100% rayon, not silk like the description says. that doesn't bother me that much because it's a really cute dress! it's also hand washable, which i like! i hate going to the dry cleaners! it fits true to size, and i know i will wear it for lots of occasions ? from casual to business. i almost always wear a small in retailer dresses and this one is the same. i'm 5'3"" and the length hits me at the knee, so it might be too short for taller girls. the only other thing that was unexpected"
1,"Adorable Pretty and with pockets! also, nice quality for the price. interesting texture."
1,Love love love! I absolutely love these pants! they are my new favorite! thank you :)
1," I am very happy with this poncho/sweater. it is my first cashmere sweater and it feels so soft and luxurious! true, it does not have full length sleeves, but if you adjust the sweater so that it comes down lower on your shoulders, it will come well past your elbows, covering most of your arms. i feel very elegant wearing it. looks great with skinny pants or leggings and boots. would recommend,"
1, Love this sweater so much i purchased the grey and the pink. so far no issues with the stitching.
1,"Cute sweatshirt I ordered the large, but it swallowed me. the store happened to have a medium, so i was able to make an exchange. the medium fit perfect. i'm delighted to include this in my wardrobe!"
1,Love! wish retailer had olive and black please! I love these jeans! perfect amount of stretch without sag. great color.  ordered my usual size 28. i wish they had these in olive and black!
1,Warm grey These are a lovely neutral to slightly warm grey pair of jeans from a great line. i wore my usual size without issues.
0,"Stretches out, washes poorly. wish i could return. So disappointed. bought these in a 29 and should've gone with a 28. they're super cute - i got the green. the fit is off. like the other reviews, they stretch out way too much. i would return these but have already washed them. they wash terribly, too. there are weird fading marks all over, even when washed in cold water like the tag states. so disappointed that i spent my gift card from christmas on these. i've been a loyal retailer customer for years and this is the first time i've been severely"
0,"Cool design, extremely tight fit The design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect. however, the fabric, despite 2% spandex, has absolutely no give from the knee down. the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch. while i was able to pull them on (size 27 for 110 lb/5.4'), i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably. with longer wear, i think they would cut off the circulation.

please post if these stretch for you enough with wear and become softer."
1,"Needs alterations Let me start by saying this skirt is beautiful quality. it is a stretchy material which makes it very comfy. i ordered a large because i am a size 8 (sometimes 10) in jeans. but - i get the waist taken in on almost every pair of jeans i have ever owned. my tailor calls me ""kim k"" lol. i was hoping i wouldn't have that same problem with this skirt but the waist is enormous (but fits my hips, thighs, and booty like a dream). i'm hoping a tailor can have the waist taken in. if i didn't have a small"
1,"A long time pilcro serif legging fan These are probably my 10th pair of pilcro legging jeans, and though i love the color, sort of a worn in, soft black/ dark gray, these particular pair fit a tiny bit more snug than any of my others. it could be the fact that these are ankle length vs most others are long with the cords being extra long and cozy. so i wonder if the fact that these are shorter they tend to sit on my legs a little differently. it may also be just this pair was cut a tiny bit smaller. i am toying with the idea of ask"
1,"Cute style but too small for me Had to return for a larger size. like the design, though. quality wasn't as expected but since i purchased on sale, i decided not to return the top but exchange for a larger size which i hope is still available."
0,"So wanted to love this but... I was expecting elbow-to-full-length sleeves and like a previous review noted, they were short. very weird look for a wrap. returned."
1,"Great fit I got this shirt in an xxsp, and it has a great slim body. the front ruffle isn't overpowering, although i don't love the ruffles on the sleeves. i think it's just a little too much, but they aren't visible under a sweater or jacket. the length is just right, so the shirt can be tucked in or left untucked without looking long and messy. the silk is just a touch sheer but not too see-through. it's a good shirt."
0,"Neckline too strange Love the fabric and it seemed warmed. but as other reviewers mentioned, the neckline was awkward."
0,Stretched out quickly I on the other hand wore these once and boy did they stretch during the day! i really hope they shrink back up...
1,"Love these pants! I bought the green pair in store and loved their fit. i ended up buying the rust color online too! i'm 5'3"" 125 and i went down a size to a 26. cause they will stretch a little. perfect length for my height too great with wedges or boots."
1,"Great dress I bought this dress after i had overnighted a different one and it wasn't going to be delivered on time. i'm so happy that i bought this dress. its so comfortable and easy to wear. i got lots of compliments on it.
it runs very large though. i ended up with a size 6. i initially tried on the 10, as i have a larger chest. the 6 still had plenty of room."
1,Nice but get loose real quick These are really nice pants - color and style are perfect but when i first put them on they seemed like they fit perfectly on me then within 30 minutes they looked 2 sizes too big - they got loose due to the material not being firm or thick enough. i would go down a size for sure. the cons aren't unsolvable so try them out!
1,Wearing this blouse right now It feels weightless and is so feminine. great for layering or on its own. so happy i purchased it - know i will get tons of use out of it.
1,Great fit These jeans are great. the rise is perfect.
1,"Lovely staple piece This sweatshirt is a very nice staple piece! i think it can be easily dressed up and down. the quality is quite nice and should hold up over time.

the sizing of this really depends on the desired fit. i elected to go with a size small because i felt that it fit a little bit closer to my figure and the length seemed to go better with skirts. but honestly, i tried the medium as well, and it was much different... just a bit more slouchy and looser in the arms if layering is desired. for reference,"
1,Love these pants! Everything that pilcro makes for pants fit me great! i am not skinny but these pants fit me in a way that you can't see my belly. i love when pilcro goes on sale because they are a great quality and getting their stuff on sale is a bonus.
0,"Where are the sleeves? I was very disappointed when it arrived and had elbow length sleeves. from the photo, it looked like full length sleeves. it went back."
1,"New favorite jeans! I bought these about a month ago and i love them! great fit, not too tight for legging jeans, which means i can dress up with a tunic and boots for work. so stretchy and comfortable, but still made out of a jean-type material. love the color - it's a bit of a gray black, so looks great with everything!"
1,"Nice fit for jeans I'm 5'4 and 125 and the 28 fit comfortably. i initially bought the 27 but felt it was snug in the seat so switched out for the 28, i'm 52 so didn't want the painted on look. they will need to be washed more frequently since they do stretch out as they are worn. love the gray color and goes with so many fall colors."
1,"Nice staple piece I love almost everything about this. first, you know, it's cashmere -- soft soft soft without being heavy. i'm a little afraid to wear it it's so nice. i got the gray, which is a beautiful, light, casual shade of gray that looks great with everything. the pockets are fantastic if a bit useless (they hang lower than i can reach with my hands).

the construction is a bit odd at first. it took me some brow-furrowing to figure out how to put it on, and i don't love the way the two front panels hang"
1, Obsessed with these pants. i have them in the green color and was looking for them to go on sale ! great fit very comfortable
0,"Fits amazing...formed holes after 1 month Really disappointing quality. these jeans are of a very poor quality material and developed holes in the inseams after only a month! i love pilcros, and am totally shocked at the poor quality...retailer, i hope this is just a fluke. not worth the money!"
1,"Better than i expected!! These are colors i normally never wear...baby pink, lavender, light blue...but what drew me to this was the wine color mixed in. it's my favorite. i also adore a good poncho. this poncho is so rich and so heavenly. super soft, very oversized, incredibly nice fabric...its like a light weight sweater. lots of movement and such a statement piece, it will look great over a white tank top, or an all black ensemble with great boots. this only comes in two sizes but runs large. i'm 5'8 and curvy...and"
1,"Excellent quality Bought the green in the store. wore them every week for 3 weeks so i bought the bronze color too. i usually wear a 26 in pilcro because they do give a little during the day. i had to go up to the 27 because the thighs were a little too snug for me. there's a zipper at the ankle so getting you foot through isn't a problem. the fabric is sturdy. it almost feels like a brushed cotton (soft to the touch). they zip up the side so are very slimming. i'm 5'4"" 120# for reference."
1," I am curvy/petite. this fits great, is true to size, is super comfortable and lined with cotton. very pretty and well made."
0,"Beautiful but runs very large This dress is beautiful, i usually wear a 6 or 8 and i ordered a 4, it is huge, i will be returning."
1,"Size down! This has a heftier fabric than seems to be in the picture online. i wish it were the same fabric as the fringed chambray dress. that, coupled with it being cut very generously, and the hip placement of the bulky pocket fabric, causes it to look quite thick and dumpy unless you pin your elbows in to show where your waist is.  i usually wear a 4-6, and bought the 2. i'm returning it for a 0 petite and see how that goes.  i love it, so i'm hoping that causes the fit to appear more as it does on the"
1,Sweet top Lightweight silk with sweet details (ruffles) fits comfortably and nice for workplace with suit or more casual.
0,"Quality look, sizing off. This dress either runs large or just has too much fabric. ordered my usual size, but it is too long and too baggy to do a thing for me. embroidery pretty, but background is more of a muddy gray, then denim as shown. if the smaller size in petite was available, i'd have exchanged it, but it is going back."
0," If you like looking like a giant square and hide things this is the way to go. for me, it completely irradiates my shape, including my neck. this will be returned."
1,"Awesome! I saw this t on sale and ordered it. i had second thoughts, thinking it would be just like a lot of ts i already have. well, i got it today and am thrilled. the fabric is so soft, a sumptuous softness that makes me feel good. the fit is the fit we all want in a great t, nice fit, not too baggy, not too tight, and it is so flattering. it doesn't show off my tummy as so many other ts do. i can wear this with jeans or a skirt. so glad i got it!"
0,Shapeless tent I tried this on in the store and it was huge. i couldn't try on a smaller size because they only had a 2 and 4. i tried on my usual size 12. i don't think the embroidery is as pretty in person either. definitely not worth the price.
1,"Love it! This dress is gorgeous in person, soft and wonderfully comfortable with two large pockets. it also comes with a cotton knit slip for added swing. i bought at size 6 which was two sizes smaller than my normal size 10 in retailer dresses. i have worn twice and each time 2 random strangers have complimented it. it dry cleaned beautifully and it is really fun to wear. the model is shows the neck wide open but it is very cute tied in a little bow. expensive maybe, but well worth it."
1,"Unique style, with comfy fit This dress definitely runs large, so i ordered it through my local store, in order to get a size that would fit. i ordered one size down, but could have gone down 2. i love the embroidered design. i just wore the dress to a slovak festival, yesterday, and it fit right in :-) very comfortable, and fun to wear."
1,"Flutter poplin top This is a great feminine top i just wish it were a little bit longer for my taste, it hit about two inches below my belly button. it was a little snug around the belly area so that's why i feel it runs small for the brand, usually the brand runs true to size but not for this top"
1,"Fantastic! Best ""jeggings"" ever! they look and fit like skinny jeans but feel like leggings. soft but substantial fabric, nice dark gray, worn in color."
1,"Cozy / sleek but poor construction First of all i love cashmere so by default i love this sweater shawl. the photos are a bit odd because you can wear it two different ways. if you wear it so it's long in front then the back comes up a bit higher and vice versa. my only big complaint is that i've worn it twice and there's already a large hole in the arm seam. poor construction which is disappointing. hopefully mine was a one-off.
i'd recommend it but definitely wait for a sale."
0, This is the oddest fitting pullover. there is too much fabric around the chest. it is fitted everywhere else but then balloons out in the front. i liked it at first but really started to dislike all the bunchiness (is that a word?). i gave it away..
1,"A classic Lets discuss the neckline: it's fabulous!
furthermore, this sweater can go anywhere,
it's dress up, dress down.

feeling low? this girl will lift you up and take you to town."
1,"New favorite jeans Love the length, color, and rise. new favorite jeans! they're a little loose around the ankle and the way they hang is the only thing i don't like."
1, Great leggings! they're well made and comfortable to wear. my only complaint is that they seem to be stretching just a little and don't fit perfectly.
1,"The smell! I absolutely love the fit and look of these jeans. i am 5'4"" and they fit perfectly. but oh my....the smell! it's like burnt chemicals. i don't know if it's just this pair, or a problem with this dye in general. any one find any solution to this? doesnt seem to go away with washing. may have to return these jeans if i can't get rid of the smell. :("
1,"Statement blouse I love this summery blouse. it sits at high hip, so no tucking in! the sleeves are fluttery and flattering to the arm. i own this same pattern in a knit, and like it so much i got the woven when i saw it. the only downsides are that it has to be ironed and it the sleeves are too big to layer under a sweater."
1,"Way too tight in the arms. don't size down! I just got this tunic last night and was excited to try it on. i could barely get it over my shoulders and once i did, it was immediately apparent that it was very tight under the arms and in the shoulders. i usually wear a 12 but listened to all the other reviewers and sized down to a 10. the 10 shoulder seams were significantly narrower than i would have expected. i don't think even a 12 would have been large enough in the shoulders.

very bummed, but yet i wasn't drawn to the colors in pers"
1,"The cream is not dotted I bought the cream version online, as the blue was sold out. i was rather disappointed to see that the cream is just a glorified sweatshirt. there are no dots, it it just the heathered cream of any normal sweatshirt. i do, however, like the design and the fit of the sweatshirt. i am sad that is was not clear (in the photos or in the name) that the cream version was not dotted. i am still deciding if i will keep the shirt. i love the design and fit, but the plain boring sweatshirt was not what i"
1,"Great fitting jeans I ordered these jeans to wear to work since they are very dark and tailored. my usual size 26 fit perfectly, but they did have to go to the tailors since they were incredibly long, which is nice for those of you that need more length.given that i usually am in skinnies, i like how they fit singly on the hips and slightly flare out towards the bottom, but not too much. these will work well with a variety of looks, making the price tag well worth it."
1,"Love Just love this sweater, have it in both colors. can be dressed up or more casual!"
1,"So pretty and unique, but runs very large This dress is really beautiful in person. it comes with a spaghetti strap clingy cotton slip underneath. it runs at least 2 sizes large. i tried my usual size 6 and needed to go down to a zero."
1,"Fall wardrobe staple I just got this in and i love it! it's happy, super soft, and will be perfect for the fall season in new orleans, since it's not too light but also not heavy. i see myself wearing this often!"
1,Love! Just like in picture! super cute and comfortable sweater!
1,"Flowing beach dress I am all about beach cover ups. i already have the leblon one from this season (which i loooooove) but i love this one too-and it is in my go-to color which is fantastic! i love beach cover ups, i always imagine the sounds of the birds, waves rolling in, and a nice breeze allowing it to flow as i walk along side the beach. my reality, of course, is chasing after screaming kids and walking along a mn pond (not rolling waves) but this dress would at least make me feel like i am in my own little wo"
0,"Bizarre seams at waist I liked the colors of this dress and the material was fine, but i could not tell from the pictures that the seams at the waist are atypical and frankly unflattering. they are scalloped at the hips, so it looks horrible if you have any hips at all."
1,"Great features Love the pockets and back of dress. the buttons on the the straps allow for them to be adjusted. that's a plus. i'm 5'3"" with an athletic build at 34d. the medium fits perfect"
1, This is a beautiful casual top...it is a loose fit that is generously sized so instead of my usual large i purchased the medium for a better fit...the length is perfect not too long or short! the colors coordinate great with denim!
0,Size up I bought an xl and they looked like they would have been a small. can't review anything else because i couldn't even get them on.... ridiculous
0,"Huge I am 5'4"" 120lbs, got xs. it was huge on me. had to return it. very trendy, great quality, unfortunate design. not worth the money."
1,"Perfect! When i saw these in the store i liked how they were different from usual leggings and, the nice fabric weight. i especially liked how they were not tight at the ankle and fit similar to a pair of ankle pants. since i wanted a slightly looser fit, i usually wear a 2/4 i went w a medium. can't wait for the weather to get colder so i can wear them with a sweater and ankle boots."
0,"Ripped as i put them on These are very flattering thick leggings that would keep you warm in the fall and winter, but when i pulled them up i got a big hole in the seam at the waistband at my first trip to the bathroom! obviously you might expect a rip if they were too tight, but these fit perfectly (even on the looser side) and ripped effortlessly. pretty embarrassing given the price! bringing these back! 

for reference ( if you decide to try your luck), i am 5'7"", 128# and my normal size s was perfect."
1,"Super soft and comfy! I look at the top quite a few times before i bought it.  i absolutely love it !  it's a super soft thick cotton material,  it drapes perfectly and wears well."
1," Stunning! bought it today and i love it! it runs big. i'm usually a xs/s and went with the xs and it's perfect. flowy and comfy. i'm 5'4"" 132lbs. great for summer and i think will transition great into fall with a cardigan."
1,"Love it! Really like the quality, color, and overall design of these jeans. they ran a little long on me, but i just cut off an inch from the bottom and they fit perfectly with some tall booties. i didn't need to get them altered because the design of them is that they are cut at the bottom and are a little frayed. so, glad that was the case given the price tag on them. i am 5'7"", 128 lbs and wear a size 28 which fit perfectly except for the length which was easily fixed. definitely recommend these jeans"
1,"Curious juxtaposition I loved the concept of the dress and that is why i chose to keep it in spite of the negatives. the grey color is drab, yet leaves room for creativity. it's stylish yet wrinkles horribly. i am 5' 2"" so it hangs too low in the front and armpits. another reviewer mentioned the buttons, yet there should be one more to bring it up in the chest. the pockets are a great space for hands, yet fabric is too thin and they are side slits, so will not hold much. i typically wear a 4 petite and the small fits"
1,"Beautiful tiered tank with embroidery for summer I bought this tank to go with the navy wide legs pants shown in the picture.  i bought this top in a 12 and could have gone a size down.  i'm very small chested.  i think that for someone with a larger chest it is probably more true to size.  i wanted the extra length, so i'm keeping the 12.  i'm 6 ft, 175 lbs and usually wear a medium or large (10/12) in retailer tops. the layering of the top is very pretty, as is the embroidery."
0,So much potential... This coat is beautiful in color and design. we could have been great friends but it was waaay too big so i had to return it. i bought the smallest size possible yet i could have been 9 months pregnant and still would have had room to spare. i also was disappointed that the sleeves were not lined like other coats in this price range.
0,"Disappointed I ordered this in both an extra small and a small... i found that there was a very big difference in the two sizes- the extra small was true to size and had a great width, but was shorter in length than i would've liked (if it shrunk at all, it would've been unwearable). the small was quite a jump in size and was a little wider than i liked, but i decided to keep that one. 

the top was very cute and comfortable when i wore it, however i just washed it once on delicate in cold water and when i"
0,"Way too much fabric This tank seemed like it should have been a maternity top. way too much fabric, not flattering for those of us with a larger bust. i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40."
1,"So cute This top is adorable. normally wear small or xs but got xxs based on reviews, and glad i did. still really loose but so cute. would have preferred petite but sold out."
1,"Fun and unique I knew i had to have this as soon as i saw it pop up in the tops section. it's effortless. love the quirky design and the overall fit. it's a tad on the large side, but i'm all about the flow these days. oh, and the poms at the bottom about sent me over the edge. fantastic piece."
1, Very comfortable great quality with beautiful crocheted front top and lovely blend of colors
0,Great design but too long Ordered med petite. love the print & design but it runs really big more like a large and length of top is not flattering . returning
1,Beautiful details!! Great top!! can be dressed up or down. the lace is great quality and i love the border detailing. i found this shirt to run pretty true to size.
1,"Lots of very nice details This henley has a lot of very nice details (lace, embroidery). the material is soft and a little bit sheer (more so in the lacey sections). it is made in india and the style strikes me as a bit indian looking. the only thing i do not like is that there are two buttons along the v shape decolltage..but there are no button holes on the other side so they are purely for decoration (you can see those buttons in the enlarged detail view only). this irks me a bit, because i would like to button the sh"
1,Love this I love the unique design! the details are wonderful. it runs a bit large but it works. a great piece.
1,Good buy These pants are amazing.  material on the thicker/heavier side.  the pants are very comfortable and very cute for the fall.  fits perfect
1,"Unique details Love the unique stitching on the shirt and the dye job.  i think it does run a little big.  the arm holes are quite deep even in a medium, but the fabric is thin so a tank underneath would probably work out well."
1,"Nice casual top I like this top. it is a nice casual top. i think it looks better on the model because it looks a bit dressy. when i tried it on, it looked good but not as dressy. the embroidery on the side gives the top a nice look. i also like the tie-dye look. the price is high, i got it on sale price. the fabric is a simple t-shirt, the embroidery makes it stand out. i am keeping it."
1," Love! i always used to wear skinny jeans until i discovered these!!! highly recommend. they elongate your legs and curve in just the right places. super flattering! plus, they are extremely comfortable. however, i'm 5 ft 2 inches and i have to wear a good 2 inch heel with them!"
1,"Flattering fit I ordered this shirt in the grey/blue color choice; the creamy grey is perfectly heathered and the blue silk-like bottom is a classy touch. the fit of this shirt in the arms, torso, and back was flattering with a little room to drape. love it!"
1,"Zip hoodie not a pullover This hoodie is really cute-i got the polka dot color and it is very soft and roomy. i am normally a small but got the medium and it fits exactly how i wanted. however-it is not a pullover and instead zips up. so odd that the pic of the hoodie is a pullover. debated returning because i wanted a pullover, but have decided to keep it because of how soft it is."
0, I couldn't get this to work for me. tried a variety of sizes and just couldn't get it to flow right. didn't purchase.
1,"Gorgeous peasant dress I love this peasant dress! i have worn it twice already with black lizard cowboy boots/frye jane boots, black tights and silver sparkly earrings -no need for a necklace because of the beautiful beading at the yoke.
the fabric is 100% rayon and has a beautiful drape, so it doesn't poof out like a maternity dress. it is lined, has 3/4 sleeves with an elasticized cuff, and hits around my knee. this dress could have definitely supported pockets in the side seams or patch pockets on the front. i have"
1,"Beautiful draped top I bought this today in black. it fits true to size and is very flattering. i love the draping, the weight of the fabric, and the length . i would buy it in another color i like it so much. i will probably wear this with jeans and boots with a sweater over it. i wasn't sure i was going to like the little connector piece across the front neckline, but it works. if it wasn't there the top would probably gape open."
1,"Another winner from isabella sinclair I saw this dress online this morning, went into a store this afternoon and walked out with it! i love this brand because the designs are modest, but feminine and practical. this dress is made of a thicker study cotton with beautiful all over embroidery. the fit is tts, and you can adjust the waist to fit loose or a bit more snug. the length is just above my knee at 5'3. i plan to wear this now with black boots and a furry vest, and later by itself with sandals and big sunnies!"
1,"Gorgeous, soft hoodie I bought this in the neutral motif, and it's exactly as it appears online except a bit more vivid in real life. the colors are ivory with dusty pink and blue/gray puffs of color. the fabric is incredibly soft. i usually wear a small in tops but went up to a medium and i'm glad i did. if you like things really fitted, i guess you could order your normal size, but since i wanted this to have some room for long sleeves underneath, i went with the medium. this zip-hoodie is great quality and it look"
0,"Beautiful but not practical A beautiful shawl but not practical. i was impressed with how elegant/romantic it first felt/looked.  however, after 5 minutes of wear, it would not stay on my shoulders. the design is very awkward and despite several attempts with different tops/tanks underneath, i kept running into the same problem. lovely for the first 5 minutes of wear and then awkwardly/annoyingly wouldn't stay on my shoulders. the neckline is undefined and it just fell off. not a great design. disappointedly returned it."
1,"Pretty patchwork! I tried this dress at the store today and couldn't leave without it. also tried the pacquerette shirtdress which has a similar boho/peasant vibe and overall preferred the fit and look of this one. plus, its lined, which the paquerette shirtdress is not for the same price. fit was very similar to the anwen peasant dress, which i also have, and the regular size xs fit me much the same as in that dress. it is maybe 1 inch longer though, but still that makes it a couple of inches above the knee for"
1,"Love this dress! I love this dress. i typically do not like or wear dresses often, and definitely not this style. i'm glad i tried something different. i received numerous compliments on how flattering and attractive it is. yes the belt is only in the front, but i cinched it very tight and it pulled the back in. i bought size s. it was very form fitting in the top and waist, and not too big through the hips. i have a 38"" bust and i can button all the top without pulling. i wore it with black tights and high brow"
1,"Artsy I saw this in the store and it caught my eye right away due to its bold color and pattern. i tried on an extra small and it was large, especially in the sleeves. i ordered an extra small in petite and it fits perfectly. i love the velvet and jeweled detail along with the cris cross tie. i wore it to work today and received so many compliments. one lady said how artsy i looked. i paired it with burgundy velvet tie up boots to complete the look. totally worth the money ladies!!"
1,"Beautiful, forgiving dress I wore this dress on thanksgiving with black tights and black flats and it looked great. the dress is forgiving if you're trying to hide a chunky waistline because the belt doesn't go all the way around. it's just in the front so it gives the illusion of a waistline and doesn't look like just a sack. if you have a great waistline, you may not like this! i wish it were a bit longer but with black tights, it looked fine. (i'm 5' 5"", no where near as tall as the model, and it was about 2"" above my"
1,"Beautiful, but big I tried this on (xs) and thought it would be great, butit was simply bog on me and boxy. unfortunately, they are out of petite in the grey color (my favorite of the 3). this top is soft and feminine if it fits properly, but too big was a little too boxy."
1,"One flaw The dress is nice, love the embroidery, love the front cinch but why not all the way around? the back is fast flat so cinching makes the sides stick out..got petite and the sizing was nice. i just didn't love the overall look on my body type."
1,"Great top This is a lovely top! sooo soft, very flattering draping if you have a bit of a tummy. i wasn't sure about it on the hanger but was pleasantly surprised when i tried it on- very glad i have it a chance!"
1,"Favorite dress This dress is a marvel. it's flattering and cute. it is great for work, a date or just a casual day. and machine washable! best thing i've ever purchased from retailer."
1," I love this dress. i would have never picked it off the hanger in the store, in fact i went right past it. however, when i was in the dressing room trying something else on i saw two girls wearing it and it was adorable. i immediately tried it on and loved it. i think it runs really big. i am normally a size 8/athletic build and i bought the x-small. i small also fit but was a bit too baggy. most tops/dresses at retailer also run big so it makes sense this does too but there is no way i am a true"
1,"Unqiue dress! Cute and different dress, cute with boots.very comfortable, runs large, could size down"
0,"Ripped before i could even wear it In a sea of dresses, this is the one that caught my eye in the whole store. i am a pear shape, and ended up trying both the medium and the large, taking the medium home. it was super flattering on, and was an appropriate length to pair with tights.

here's where the problem happened. i wanted to wear this dress for thanksgiving, i put it on, and as i tightened the drawstring to cinch in the waist - riiiiiiiiiip! the drawstring ripped through the fabric at the waistband. so disappointed."
1,Cute but not really a winter dress Surprised that this is a fall/winter dress. the embroidery is beautiful but the material isn't that thick and the tie at the waist is unusual. would have been better if rather than having the tie built into the dress it was separate.
0,Zipper? Like the other reviewers i was disappointed to receive the gray dotted sweatshirt with a zipper down the center when it was not in the model picture. looks like this item has since been removed from this listing...would have been nice to have the correct item pictured in the first place.
1,Better than your average t-shirt It's exactly how it appears in the pictures-awesome shirt
1,Love it! I bought this shirt in the turquoise color with the navy trim and love it! color is as pictured. shirt is very soft and flowy. the length was a little shorter than expected (the slits on the side almost reach the top of my jeans) so i'm glad i got the regular xs and not the petite. this shirt is unique without getting too crazy!
1," Lovely! at 5'6"", 34a-28/29-36, the size small was a great fit. moss color is really quite grey. drapes beautifully and is an easy wear."
0,"Very thin material I was so excited to try this on in the store, because i've had my eye on it online. unfortunately, it is not like the picture. the material is very thin, almost translucent. i also could not figure out how it get it on! the cape has short sleeves, not long, as it appears in the picture, and the folds of fabric would not drape quite right in the front. love the look of black design on white. hopefully retailer can redo this in a thicker cape for the fall, but for now, i'll skip this one."
1,"Perfection This top is soft, flattering, modest enough to wear to work, but subtly sexy (and i'm amply endowed at 36d). i just wish i'd gotten one in every color."
1, Very pretty and has potential. only down side - i thought it was more like a cardigan with sleeves but it's really more of a shawl and the photos and descriptions are misleading
1,"Cute and colorful I tried this on at the store and am coming online to order it in petite. i'm 5'1"" and the length hit me just below the knee in the regular length so i'm hoping it will hit just above the knee in petite. it was very cute, might run a bit large but basically true to size. size down if between sizes. it has a little bit of sparkle beading around the neck which is nice."
1,"Lovely black and white embroidered dress This black dress with raised white embroidery is lovely and flattering. the fabric has a nice texture and is medium-weight cotton, and machine washable. the dress is unlined. it's a bit hard to get on and take off even though the buttons can be undone, which helps. there is a tie at the waist, drawstring-style. i only wish my store had the petite size, as i am wondering whether the xs that fit me in the store will still fit as an xs p."
0,"Fleeced tula hoodie I'm upset. i ordered the grey sweatshirt and while the description says the sweatshirt has a zipper, the picture of the grey does not have a zipper. i prefer no zipper, so when it arrived in the mail with a zipper, i was disappointed. it's going back. why have a model where an item that you're not offering???"
1,This is a zippered hoodie Just wanted to review so people know this hoodie has a zipper. it's very soft and comfy but i was looking for a pullover hoodie and am disappointed that once again retailer's picture doesn't match the actual product. it does fit true to size however.
1,Cute! Got this today and highly recommend it! it fits perfectly and is very flattering! i can see wearing this all wear round! perfect date shirt!
1,"So fun! I saw this dress online and b-lined it to the store to try on. it is a beautifully made dress. lots of great detail with stitching and beading on the front placket. feels very boho and chic. i have received lots of compliments while wearing this dress. i was almost turned off by the price, but decided to see it in person. worth every penny. wear it with sandals or tall boots, could have worn a medium, but a little tight for 38c on top."
1,"Cute, but not black So this shirt is very cute, i like the drape (if you can get it arranged properly), but it is not black, more of a charcoal bordering on heathered navy. i wear all black so it quite obviously stands out as a different color in my closet. i am keeping it, thinking i will wear it with leather, since it is flattering and the keyhole is something different. i am a true medium and bought the medium and it fits fine. a little shorter in the back but not a deal breaker."
1,"Buy this top!! I love everything about this top. first, it's super flattering, especially if you have a tummy. i am small chested, and it makes me look a little chestier than i am. i tried on both the xs and s in the black (it's really a charcoal gray) but preferred the fit of the xs. note: i'm 5'8"" / 136 lbs and typically wear an xs or s in most retailer tops. the small seemed too drapey and the armholes were a tad big. my store didn't have the wine color or i would have purchased it too."
1,"Picture doesn't do it justice I think this shawl is much more stunning on than on the hanger. i think it will be a great piece to transition into fall, wearing it over a black or white tee. it can be dressed up or down. especially for the sale price, a great piece!"
1,"Fantastic product This arrived today and i am thrilled with it. the material is soft but not at all clingy. it drapes perfectly, falling just above the knee. there is a matching slip that is as nicely made as the dress itself. what a find!"
0, I loved the style so i ordered on line. it runs small and the arm inserts are so low its awkward to wear. i wish the cut was better cause i love the look but not the fit. i am returning this item..
1,Boho chic Love this dress! the neckline is gorgeous
0,"Cuter online I wanted to love this dress - and did from the picture online. when it arrived, the black already looked faded and old. also, the embroidery looks like a grandma, but not in a cute vintage way. the fabric is stiff, which causes a boxy, unflattering look. had to return it."
1,"Modern with retro flair Very cool top! i purchased this in the black, which is more of a very dark gray (imagine sanded silk). it's very figure flattering and accentuates curves. it also disguises any minor tummy issues. not to clingy, but follows your form. the fabric is well made with a perfect drape to match the style. definitely a winner!"
1,Nice quality Colors are vibrant (i ordered the blue color combo) material is light and feels great against your skin.
1,"More beautiful than it looks! This dress is absolutely gorgeous! the colors are actually very bright. it has a little embroidery and beading in the chest area. the fabric is actually very soft and it comes with built in slip. i found that it runs true to size. i got a medium, as i wanted it to be more roomy. i'm planning to wear it with booties, long boots, or sandals in the spring. i think it will make a great teacher dress."
1," Very figure flattering!! i am 5'6"" 128 lbs 32b chest and size xs is perfect"
1,"Nice, but not quite as pictured These are nice, flattering bra with light to medium suport. however the colors and patters are not quite as pictured. i almost suspect they are slightly different on each bra. exmaple: on the picture online the left side seems to be a light blue and the right one orange. on the bra i received the left side is a darker, bluishgreen color. the right side is orange and light purple. i would hae prefered the colors on the photo but it is not a big deal i guess. i ordered the color block shorts as we"
0,"Disappointed I also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images. it is very thin as others have said. the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs. structured. it is more similar to a cape or shawl design. if you;'re looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design, this is not it. i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design."
1,"Uniquely designed shawl I purchased this online because i just loved the gorgeous designs and embroidery. it has a unique cut to it as it has wrist holes but is otherwise open. i have a difficult time keeping it from falling off of my shoulders when i wear it over bear skin. i hope it will stay in place when i wear it over long sleeves or a sweater. overall i am happy with it, but i think it may run small as it hits the model at her wrists but hits me above my elbow. i am not very tall or long-limned so it seems strang"
1, I cannot believe how different this top looks in person. i purchased this in the store and fell in love with it immediately. viewing the pictures on here does not do the top justice. it is very form fitting and compliments large busted women. the cut is not too low and lays beautifully.
1,"Love this tee! I had my eye on this tee for awhile, and finally ordered the turquoise/navy in the small. as soon as i received it, i ordered it in the taupe/peach and am contemplating one more! i plan to layer it now and can't wait to wear it solo next spring and summer. the colors are gorgeous (although the taupe is more dark gray which i love), the material is very soft, stretchy and comfortable, but it's the very flattering cut that sold me. it hangs beautifully and doesn't cling to my middle but skims it p"
1,"Great quality I am generally a size l, and after reading reviews, sized down. the inner layer was a little snug, but this was not an issue because of the outer layer. great dress!"
1,"Why no reviews? This dress is a winner, i'm baffled that there is only one review? i thought this was a dolan dress. the material is soft and substantial. the cut and style hides figure flaws without adding bulk. this versatile dress is perfect for all seasons and all social situations. i'm 5'3"" 135# 38/28/35 and purchased size m."
1,"Trying to like it This is a busy dress that makes me think ""boho-glam holly hobby"". i bought my usual size and it looks like nightmare of a nightgown on me. i'm going to try a size smaller in the hopes i will love it more. i'm recommending this dress for those that like the quirky whimsical hippie eclectic crafty style."
0,"Strange fit The pattern and fabric are lovely, but the sleeves are short (unlike the photo) so it drapes very strangely. i personally could not figure out how to wear it so that it looked anything remotely like the photo. had to return this one."
1,"Elegant and chic I just bought this and really think it is a great dress! it is conservative, and i will be able to wear it to teach or play the organ at my church. i am a church organist and college professor and need conservative clothes, yet i do not like to look ""frumpy."" this is cute and chic, yet conservative. also j got 25% because it is black friday. thank you retailer!!!"
1,Pretty boho three season dress Great dress - fits tts (i am a 6p and purchased a sp). looks good with boots or ballet flats.
0,"Not what i expected I found this dress to run very large. the fabric was substantial but rather coarse. also, the lighter color in the pattern is lavender and not white or cream."
1,Crazy comfortable Perfection. soft. lived in feel and look without holes or rips. and for someone who is 5 ft 2 in. they are just the right length if i don't feel like cuffing the bottom. fit tts.
0,"Want to love it, poor quality I love this shirt, in fact, i love all bordeaux tops from retailer. i followed the instructions to hand wash only and after it was wet and then lay flat to dry, it may fit a child. it is a belly top. i want to love this, but it shrunk so bad even with the hand wash only instructions."
1," As other reviews noted, this runs large--huge is more like it. it's great quality, but i'm wondering now if the s/m would take me through the third trimester of pregnancy (which is why i ordered a m/l). i'm 5'7"", and if i were any less, i don't think this would work for me at all."
0,"Nah I always have to try on tops of retailer. i know this, and yet i ordered a top through the website anyway. i don't think i'll do it again. the drape of the top seen in the pictures did not translate in real life because the top scratched up pretty quickly. ironically, when i washed it (according to directions) it also shrunk quite a bit."
1, Nice basic shirt to wear with jeans. it is super soft and hangs nicely. runs true to size.
1,"This is a tent! I am a 10/12 and ordered the m/l. it's very large! i normally take a large in retailer, but i can't figure out my size in this. it's very wide. i love the denim patchwork detail so i will order the s/m and see how it is."
1, I ordered this in a small and it fit perfectly. i love the longer length so that it can be worn with leggings. the detail is so pretty especially the colorful side panels.
0,"Not what i hoped it to be! This top is very strange. i agree with the other reviewer in that i think it's not cotton. it clung and got bunched up around my chest. like in a static cling way. there's just something about the way it hangs that is not flattering. too bad as i was really looking forward to wearing this but alas, it's going back."
0,"Sack-ish I wanted to love this so much! i am 5'8 and normally do a size large in retailer, but based on the previous review i sized down. the top fit fine, but the bottom just sort of poofed out. not flattering. it does have pockets which are amazing, but overall, just wasn't a good fit. the top is t-shirt material, not denim."
1,"Great! I bought these leggings for yoga. i love them. the material is so soft and also seems sweat wicking which is a plus. the back detail on the calf is a nice touch of flair compared to basic leggings. the waistband is wide and did not fold over during practice! for reference, i am 5'4, 130 lbs and i purchased a m. fit was great. i normally wear size 27-28 in pants. would recommend."
1,"Vibrant, super soft top This seems like a great top! i have only worn it once, but it is super soft and comfy, yet stylish. sleeves are fun. color is vibrant as shown."
1,Cute and comfy I purchased this shirt to wear postpartum so i could easily be comfortable but still cute. it will work well for the fall with some cute jeans and booties. i cannot wait to wear it....any day now!  great choice.
0,"Fabric might not be cotton! stretched out! I ordered this top because 1. the online product page states the fabric is cotton. 2. i liked the style with the scarf insets. 3. the colorful embroiderey would be a welcome companion for my many pairs of pilcro chinos.

when i opened the package several tiny round beads rolled out. after examining the detailing, i found where the beads were missing.

size: i normally wear a small for most retailer brands, but i know nothing about slone rouge. i went with a small since it appears oversized on"
0,"It's very cute I love the color blocking but dress hangs a little strange on me. love the pockets, thought about sending it back and decided it is very comfortable, i will wear it but not quite what i was hoping for."
1,"Beautiful It is a beautiful shirt and fits perfectly. i purchased it in ivory and although not a true ivory, it has some pinkish tones to it, it is absolutely beautiful. looks perfect with a long necklace and jeans."
1,Cute tunic This top runs large for sure and reminds me more of a tunic due to the length. nice detailing around neck and sleeves and the paisley print on the side hems is super cute. size down!
1,"Nice top Soft material, lays nicely. got an xs but usually wear a smaill. got it in the mail and it is wrinkly so will need to steam it."
1,"New favorite shirt Regarding the product, high quality materials and overall make. extremely comfortable and flattering cut. i'd love this in all the colors of the rainbow."
1,"Love it. This is a beautiful top, the fit is very flattering. i'm tall with broad shoulders and the sleeves hit just above my elbow. i wear it on the weekends and to work...very versatile. i washed it in the washing machine and hung to dry, it's the same size and no fading..not sure about the others below with shrinkage issues. highly recommend it!"
1,Gorgeously draped top This top is extremely well made. the fabric is so soft. the style is very stylish. it is very figure flattering and chic. a keeper! i'm petite and the style is not overwhelming.
1,So simple This top flows so nice. i get so many compliments when i wear it. plus the color is an interesting blue
1, So glad i finally bought this! love it!!! and have received many compliments. wore it with brown over the knee boots. one of my fave all time outfits right now.
0,I wish it looked like it did on the model To be clear i am not built like your models but the biggest problem was the way in which it tented out from the bustline down
0,"Complete color shocker! I ordered the blue version of this dress thinking the accent stripes were black. they were not ! they were wine colored. i liked the color, but not in combination with the other colors in the dress. black would have been a better look. i had to take it back. sad..."
0,"Best on a slender body type Tried this on in the store - i love the colors but the cut was just not flattering. the liner was fine, but the dress flared out excessively and looked like a tent. tried it with a belt for some definition but the fabric was too thick."
1,"Small in bust, tts in torso This top is a tough one. i ordered my usual medium. i'm 5'7"", 165 lbs, 34c, and wear a 10/m pretty much all the time (tops and bottoms). let's begin:

the bad:
when i tried it on, i found the bust to be too small, and the darting on the sides puckered in a very non-flattering way. the ruffle at the neck stood up more like a mock turtleneck (which is not my scene). also, the fabric seemed a little thin for chambray.

the good:
the pattern is adorable. the sleeveless design would be great under bl"
1,"Pretty Very good quality. love the length of it. i wore it with a belt, since on me without it looked a bit too big. i bought the blue one."
0,"More wrong than right... I ordered this after reading through the reviews. i realize the reviews were mixed, but thought i'd take a chance. unfortunately there were more things wrong than right with this dress. right: i loved the various colors (yes, it shows black but is actually brown). i also loved that it was lined and the lining was semi-attached to the dress, with the same hi-to-low hemline. wrong: as said by others, the sleeves were very tight! the dress is roomy and does swing but unlike the model, it isn't real"
0,"Overpriced potato sack After readying the reviews of this dress, i thought for sure i was purchasing a winner. boy, was i wrong! first, this dress feels like a potato sack and looked like one on. i felt that it was very boxy and more of a o' one size fits all' sizing. it did not embrace my curves at all. the material was not as chic as i would have thought. overall, the entire dress was not flattering. honestly, i do not understand what the rave reviews were talking about it."
0,"Ugly! Too much material everywhere. i am 122lbs 5'4"" and i ordered an xs as usual. i was overwhelmed in a blanket of knitted material of muted colors. nice green slip, though. i will return it asap. this is super-ugly."
0,"Huge like a circus tent Okay i'm short, so this tent dress is seriously huge on me and not flattering. the fabric is so pretty, but this dress must be for a tall girl. no shape at all!"
0,"Unless you are twiggy, this is shape less This dress hangs horribly. unlike the photo, the waist does not cinch. too bad. the colors are great and the quality of the material is nice. because i bought it on sale, i may try to tailor it to work, but unless you are willing to do that, its a no go. :-("
1,"Beautiful and comfortable I was on the fence about this dress but so glad i did, thanks to the reviews i sized down from my normal medium to a small and this dress is definitely one of my favs!!!! it is a quality comfortable material that does stretch and allows you movement with ease. the illusion slims me in the middle where i need it most. i adore this dress."
1,"Beautiful I almost missed this, i snagged it during the black friday sale online. i got an extra small and it fits great-not too fitted. the back is a cotton material with some stretch to it. the embroidery is beautiful."
0,"Not for broad shoulders This was pretty to look at: nice weight, lining, colors. i tried it on and whoa. ridiculously bad. i have broad shoulders and a small waist and this accentuated the broadness of my shoulders and eliminated any hint of shape below that. the model photo looks great, so i imagine this will look great on anyone with slim shoulders and narrow hips. definitely not for me, though..."
0, I am returning the dress. it has too much volume and is not flattering at all
1,"Interesting and different I ordered this dress in both colors. i'm very fair and blonde and the darker dress just swallowed me up - looked really messy on me. the lighter one.....love it. it's very flowy and not form fitting, of course, but something about the lighter color just seems less overwhelming."
1,Nice style!! I like this dress a lot. it does not have much form but with a belt looks great!
1,"Great color options but totally frumpy I bought both color options in this dress and they are both gorgeous but i think this dress must only look good on the model and her body types because i put it on and cringed. i'm 5'7"" and slim. it was matronly. i also ordered my usual size small and felt like the medium might have been better? the picture of blue colored dress looks more fitted around the waist and these dresses and very loose. the only way it would be flattering is if you added a belt. keep that in mind if you do buy. pretty"
1,"Swing dress Love this dress! the stripes are flattering, the material is interesting and it swings! it's feminine and fun!"
0,"Huge This is a beautiful looking dress, but definitely runs wide and long. i'm 5'4, 112llbs and my normal xs swallowed me up. if it had been available in xs petite then that probably would have worked, even though i normally never go with petites. it is a gorgeous dress, and would probably work on those ladies who are taller."
1,"Gorgeous, flattering, perfect for xl I ordered the peach/ivory/tan version in size xl and i love everything about this dress. i'm size xl and a pear-shape so dresses can be hit or miss. this one is a favorite. it's so soft. the mix of colors and the sizing of the stripes/pleats is flattering. it's nice being more fitted on top & flowy through the bottom. i love this dress so much! i'm having fun pairing different combos of necklaces, vests, pins, belts & boots with it. i'll get good use out of this through spring. comfortable, pret"
1,"Very figure flattering I have been self conscious about a recent weight gain going from a size 6 to a size 10-12, but this dress makes me look & feel skinny again. i know people have suggested that vertical stripes help if you want to elongate your figure. it is true. thanks to this dress i look like my old self, and i am super comfortable wearing this all the time. you can wear this dress from day to night, you can dress this up or down. it looks great with a jean jacket and high-tops, or high-heeled booties with a n"
1,"Creativity required don't pass, especially for $50 By itself, this dress is a disaster. it's semi-maternity and offers no shape at all. however, with a belt, it really becomes the sweetest sweater dress. i can't believe how flattering the dress becomes with a belt, the skirt falls perfectly , it's perfect, especially with it's rich colors.

for $50, you can't go wrong and i'm positive you need this dress. boots, heels, jacket, whatever, it goes up and down, it's perfect!"
1,"Unique piece I have worn this beautiful sweater with all kinds of outfits! i love to dress it down with ripped skinnies, booties, & some long layered necklaces. i did not have as big an aversion to the itch factor as the other reviewer, but it is definitely not super soft or anything. it fit a little larger than true to size in my opinion. i should've ordered a small. i think it's a very unique winter staple that matches almost every single thing in my wardrobe. it's versatile, snuggly, & warm i'd recommend"
0,"Not good for sensitive skin I saw online, great quality sweater dress- reviews about seemingly extra fabric- easy fix with a seamstress. i have very sensitive skin and wear long sleeves under sweaters. wool, angora, mohair! 5'1, xsp, tts (length/arms) but lots of extra fabric for width. just trying it on was too itchy for me."
0,Sent it back This runs super big and it just wasn't flattering--way too much fabric. i wanted to love this dress.
1, It's a perfect maternity dress but i love that i will still be able to wear it with a belt once the baby comes.
1,"Great dress I walked into a hair salon wearing this dress, and everyone who walked by complimented me. to me, that's a definite winner! i got the blue color, and the various colors in it are vibrant and lively. the underdress is like a full slip and an added bonus. this probably also makes the dress hang the way it should. there's no static or clinging where there shouldn't be. i was afraid i might be too short to pull this off, but i absolutely love it."
1,"No-brainer I saw this dress online first and suspected i would like it, but the price scared me away. then, while visiting in portland, i saw it on sale at an retailer store. when i came out of the dressing room to look in a bigger mirror the store clerk said, ""well that's a no-brainer!"" i thought the same thing. i love this dress so much i actually would have paid full price for it. it's super fun and easy to wear; i paired it with navy blute tights and suede ankle booties. i'm 5'6, 138 lbs and the m"
0,Large and wide This colors and fabric of this dress are beautiful and i really wanted to love it but from the chest to the hips there is too much fabric and it give you no shape at all. it had to go back.
1,Vintage luxury I just got this at the black friday sale..... i may have passed it by had i not been in an adventurous mood ( i usually wear brighter colors). it feels wonderful....cozy and silky like expensive pjs!! looks very glamorous yet laid back... i feel like i am in a 40's romantic film.. i got a ps and it fits flowy. it was the only one so i was not able to try the xs. love it! it was cold today so i wore a cami under it with lace peeking thru the low neckline .
1, This dress fits great and is very warm for the winter months.
1,"I love this dress I just ordered this dress in blue on sale and it was such a bargain for the quality and look. it's a very comfortable dress that swings and flatters my body type, which is tall and thin. i think this dress would not work on a more busty woman's frame, but it definitely works for me. i'm 5'9 and 135 pounds and a small is plenty big (i often take a medium). i definitely recommend this dress."
1,I love tiny! I own many tiny tops and like other reviews have stated this is a favorite. the ombre design makes it stand out. the embroidery is beautiful. these are usually tops i throw on during my time off/weekends and i have received many compliments on this one. tiny usually runs small but this is true to size or even a size smaller.
0,"So unflattering I bought this dress online and was hoping it would be a great comfortable staple.. it may be the most unflattering piece of clothing i have ever tried on ever! i let my sisters try it on too, to see if they wanted it or liked it better, but it was awful on them as well. i ordered the xs in blue. it was beyond enormous and was just plain and unflattering. i am 5'7' and 115. i love swing dresses,i just don't think is cut well."
1,"Beautiful dress! beautiful style! I wasn't sure how clingy this dress might be or how it would look on my ""curvy"" body. it's actually really lovely. it runs large but not overwhelming. nice length; above the knee in the front, slightly longer in the back. the colors are really beautiful (i got the darker color). will definitely wear this with a belt, otherwise i think (as other reviewers said) it will be too maternity-looking. i got this at a great sale price!"
1,"Received lots of compliments on this dress! I saw this online when it was full price and was tempted to buy it because i liked it, but did not. when i saw it on sale, definitely wanted to try it! i bought a large and it was too big in the torso area, so i returned and got a medium and it fit better and flattered my figure better. i so rarely wear a medium in anything retailer, so i would say this runs large.

i have received 6 compliments on this dress the first day i wore it! it is comfortable, love the colors and design, it is fun. very g"
1,Luv it Ilove this dress even though it does run big i put a belt with it and it looks stunning.
1,Fabulous!! Saw this in the store and loved it! the photos on line do not do this justice. material is soft and substantial. if you love the look of raw edge you'll love this piece. as usual i wish it were a bit shorter even in petites as i am only 5' but kept it and love it.
0,"Swimming in fabric This looked fabulous on the model, of course, and i love sweater dresses. but even in an xs, i was drowning in fabric and looked ludicrous. concept is good but execution went terribly wrong somewhere. a definite return."
1,"Winner There's not much to add to what reviewers have said. beautiful, flowing, light-weight fabric. flattering cut. gorgeous ombre tone with feminine embroidery. a great shirt for hanging out of dressing up. this is one of those shirts you expect from retailer. you wouldn't find it anywhere else.

i've had this shirt a couple of months now and have to note that even with careful treatment, some of the embroidery is coming loose. it's gotten to the point that i want save it for special occasions rather t"
1,Well fitted dress I was pleasantly surprised how this dress fit me. very comfortable and flattering on me. love the look. need to watch not to wear anything scratchy as it may pull the fabric
1,"Nora swing dress This dress is really beautiful. the material is soft and sways, but it is sweater-like, not flimsy. it does seem to run maybe a little large throughout, but i liked that look. not form-fitting, has more of a drape."
1,"Unique sweater/swing dress I love this dress. based on reviews, i ordered the small, and the only problem i had was that, while the dress is quite large, the detachable slip lining was quite tight and fitted, which i didn't find comfortable. so i replaced it with a flowy silk slip of my own, and the results are great. the fiber content contains a bit of wool, but i do not find it scratchy to my skin. and i am lovin' the hi-lo aspects of the hem. fun dress for winter!"
1,"Cute, cute! Love this dress! so cute and comfortable! good for all seasons, has a very nice under slip. only issue is that it will snag very easily. great color and i get lots of compliments!"
1,"Adorable print I knew i needed to have this shirt as soon as i saw it and luckily for me, it was already on sale. i read the other reviews and ordered a s (usually order xs or s, but went with s for this one because i was worried about the fit of the bust). overall the shirt is huge on me. i considered returning for an xs but suspect that would also be too big and maybe too short. i decided i could get it tailored instead for the cost of exchange shipping. so i will be doing that. otherwise i love everything a"
1,"Comfortable easy dress I needed to write a review only because i feel like the dress is getting a bad rap by other reviewers. it is a loose, flowy, swing dress. i typically wear structured fit and flare dresses, but i do love a feminine, loose, casual dress from time to time too. this totally fit the bill. it is true to size, fitted on the arms, loose and swingy everywhere else. i got the peach color and love it. the cotton slip underneath is very comfortable too. i ordered the sp and it hits just above my knees in th"
0,"How many stylists did it take... ... for the model to look like this?
pros: nice quality. the colors of the blue version, at least, are rich and beautiful. note that the dark color pictured is really brown, not black. the colors are also much brighter than they appear in the picture. it is a medium to heavy weight sweater knit which is well suited for fall-winter. it is layered over a bright navy poly slip.
cons: i am 5'8 135# . i looked like i was wearing a circus tent in med. the sleeves were more dolman than fitted. i imagin"
1,"Great style, loose fit I wore this dress for the first time the other day and it fit larger than i expected. it is definitely not form- fitting, however, i still love it. just note the previous description if that is the sort of fit you were looking for. as far as the length goes, i am 5'3"" and the dress covers my knees."
1,Very comfy dress The quality and material of this dress is very nice! it's true to size and very pretty.
0,"Too much material I wish this dress was more fitted.. the dress looks more fitted and more vibrant in the picture. i bought this dress in an xs, but i am not sure that going smaller would take care of the amount of material in this dress. it was shapeless and did not fall as nicely as it appears. i think someone with a fuller figure would look very nice in this dress. sad to say that it is going back."
1,"I love this dress This is a great addition! it's comfortable, pretty, and can be dressed up and down. most importantly it's slenderizing and a great length for me! i bought it in my regular size, but bought the petite size, noting the model is 5'10"" and where the dress stopped on her. i'm 5'6"". the dress fits perfectly and is a great length for me! it also comes with a lovely, blue slip! such great quality for the price!"
1,"Unique - size down Love this dress, i've already worn it many times. i started off with a small but had to go to xs which is smaller than my normal size in order to get the fit as pictured. the length is great and works with tights or boots.

great unique dress!"
0,"Wanted to love... Really wanted to love, the top was very flattering and loved the material: very swingy and forgiving. but way to much material, i was drowning in it. sized down to x small but no go."
1,"Great maternity dress Another reviewer mentioned this was maternity-ish. i am currently almost 5 months pregnant, and i have to say: this is a wonderful maternity dress, even if that's not what it was made for. when not pregnant, i think this might have been a little overwhelming (and i guess we'll see next year if that's the case for me) -- there is a lot of fabric here. i am usually a small or medium in antrho dresses, and i am wearing a small in this now with room to grow as my stomach grows. the colors on the blu"
0,"Beautifully colored potato sack I'm 5'4, 115 and the xs swallowed me like a snuggie. i suppose the tons of fabric might drape nicely if you're 5'8 and above? it drooped and hung comically large from every angle under arm, body and skirt. a belt was no match for that much fabric. the colors are gorgeous and it appeared well made, but the design was awful."
1,"Great style I love the style of this jumpsuit. it is so much more interesting than a long dress. i am 5' 7"" and need a few inches hemmed which will cut off some of the pretty embroidery at the bottom. my biggest regret with this is that it is not made from better fabric. it is a little stiff and scratchy. if it were more silky it would be a dream. but i am happy to have this in my closet. i purchased this in the berry red."
1,"Love this under-all cami tank ? Originally i bought this in black and white. recently purchased several more in different colorways . why? it's just perfect to wear as an under tank/cami. i'm a busty gal and sometimes cami straps can be too thin and dig into my shoulders. this is soft, smooth and provides just enough coverage. very flattering fit on its own as well. great under loose knit or low cut sweaters. love!"
1,Staple tank! Love this tank. material and fit are great. love that it's reversible. highly recommend!
1,"Love me some raspberries I had my eye on this piece since it came out, but thought it was a little pricier than i like spending... but it finally went on sale. alas, all the petite sizes are gone, but i decided to order the regular xs anyway. (the length quote is long, but i figured maybe with heels?). then the xxs became available and i snatched that too...so glad. the xxs fits better and isn't as long (i have to wear heels, don't get me wrong, but the xs was still long with heels). it is soft and lovely, the xxs linin"

I hardly believe i have not reviewed htis yet... so i tried it on in the sotre and was not convinced, my usual xs looked huge and hte ""hip"" part flared out in a funny way. i did, however decide to order it online in petties, to see( i really do love the design in the front, and the hemline is fun and unusual). they didn't have my usual xs so odrdered xxs, just to see... what a great choice, it fits like a glove now and the swaeter is jsut so beautiful... jsut wish it wasn't so pricey, but wil ke"
1,"Raspberry jumpsuit I am an retailer employee, i love this romper and suggested it to several of my regular ladies the day it arrived in our store. they both loved the piece before they tried it on...the jumpsuit is so cute and has the special flair of a piece you would expect to find at retailer. the piece is lined which is an added bonus but there is where the issue with the jumpsuit arrives. the lining is to short makes it feel awkward. i ordered the xxs petite, and it fits perfect, except the inside l"
0, I disagree with other reviewers on this. it looks a lot better in picture on the model. i found it to run large and not fit in the most flattering way. fabric feels great. i want to love it but it is going back.
1,"Regular woman can look like a model in this one I have the raspberry jumper and i feel like royalty in it. the silk is luxurious and looks expensive. when i walk if feels like it is fluttering around me like butterflies around sleeping beauty. typically i am quite disappointed when trying a jumper and find that what looked amazing on the model simply makes me look goofy. but this one is the exception. i think the super long length (although problematic) as well as the soft elegant drape of he fabric, as well as the angled cut at the bodice ar"
0,"Love but also very annoying I love this tank, it is so comfortable but it does have its flaws. it rolls up every time i walk or do anything, it becomes very bothersome."
1,"Re: love this jumpsuit! Purchased it in raspberry. first time it came in the mail, it was stained and the hem looked like it had been dragged through the mud! come on customer service, you need to be more diligent about checking out items before you ship them! i ordered it again, and this time it was a new jumpsuit in plastic, so pristine. 
i am a size 8-10, and the small fit me fine. the lining is a little tight in the crotch area, but i can put up with it for the style of this jumpsuit!!"
0,"Soft, but faded Yummy, soft material, but very faded looking. so much so that i am sending it back. if a faded look is something you like, then this is for you."
0,"Wanted to love this Terrible fit for a longer torso.  runs small in hip and lining, huge in the waist.  not good for an hourglass figure!"
1,"Gorgeous!!! The reason i gave this an overall rating of 4 stars is because of the sizing. the jumpsuit runs big and the black does not have a petite option; otherwise, i would give this 5 stars. this jumpsuit is so gorgeous that i had to buy both colors. i bought the black in medium and it looks absolutely beautiful on but i will have to take it to get it altered; it is way too big on me. i really need a petite in this but i still bought the black and am getting it altered. 

i loved this jumpsuit so much"
1," Just purchased these online and couldn't wait to try them on! they are soft, comfortable and my new favorite pair of jeans! i love them! i am 5'8 and sz. 29...the color and quality are above my expectations :)"
1, Beautiful dusty rose color! the fit is fabulous! love the sleeve and hem length! very flattering and does not cling.
1,"Wow Love love this! i was hesitant to buy this at first - the reviews made it seem so big and i wasn't sure if it was my kind of outfit. but i wanted to try a jumpsuit and this was the perfect find! the xs was a typical retailer size for me, so the size was good in this, too. the color is fabulous and the fit is great. the rise is slightly short, but not a problem. i can't wait to where it for my next great event. i wish i could buy it in the black, too."
1,"Wished it fit I really liked the fabric and the design of this sweater, but the sleeves hung at an odd length (no way to push them up like on the model) and the sweater was large on me. i have broad shoulders but am otherwise petite. unfortunately i had to return this. glad others are having better luck."
1,Great tank This tank is soft and flexible. great fit with wonderful material. very pleased.
1,"In love! I am in love with this piece! i am long waisted and large busted so finding a jumpsuit to fit me can be challenging, having said that i sized up when ordering this, wrong ladies....no need....i had to reorder my normal size and even that was roomy, but in a good way as i prefer belting it with my huge concho belts. i purchased it in the rasberry and i am still scratching my head as to why the black sold first, the red is stunning and i find it more versatile going from casual to dressy. and this"
1, I just bought this dress and love the fit. i'm pear shaped and it's very flattering! it's not clingy because it is lined and it has great drape. it's also seasonless. it will look great with boots and a sweater or kimono.
1,Super soft I ordered this top because it was on a crazy sale and i'm really glad i did. it's super soft and comfortable but still very cute so its versatile. you can wear it down or dress it up with a great skirt or jacket.
1," My new favorite dress. very flattering beautiful color, and great length. fabric feels very good as well. i'm usually s/m, purchased the medium and it fits perfectly"
1,"Gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous This jumper is gorgeous! i usually don't instantly spend almost $300 on one piece without contemplating, but as soon as i tried this on, i fell in love. i had to order it online because i needed the xsp as the xs in store was way too big. please be warned that this runs large and definitely buy the petite if you are petite or a little taller... i am 5'3"" for reference and even at 5'3"" it's barely short enough to not be too long on me. so if you are an inch or two taller, i would recommend the pe"
1," This is an awesome piece and i got many complements while wearing it! it is that rare combo of super comfortable yet amazing look all in one. it does run a bit big, especially on top but the stride is short so i had to keep my regular size or i would have had a wedgie all night."
1,"Amazing! Such a gorgeous weight, cut and style! the button detail is adorable and the fit of the sweater is fantastic. the hem style, (not sure what you would call it), is incredibly flattering for an hourglass figure. i am 5'4, 133 and 34dd. fit is tts, maybe a bit large but nothing crazy. love"
1,"Pretty color, but wrinkles a lot I recently wore this to a beach wedding, and it worked out great with a cute denim jacket. the orange color is pretty and vibrant, and it is comfortable to wear. i like the length of it, and it flows really well as you walk. the cons are that it wrinkles really easily; i used a steamer extensively when it arrived to steam out the wrinkles, but it still had a wrinkled look to it because i think of how the seams are. as i got back up from sitting down for 10-15 minutes, the front and back were alr"
1, This tunic is a nice basic to have. it is like a light sweater knit. the arm holes are a little large and hang low but can easily be remedied by wearing a camisole underneath. nice with leggings or skinny jeans.
1,"Lovely, but. . . I really couldn't tell if i like the dress or not - it was swimming on me and i always wear a size small. design is great with cross straps in the back, thin, silky fabric. i would call the color more of a bright coral/orange - not a bright red.i'll get back if i decide to try ordering the xs. . ."
1,Pretty but too unstructured The colors are beautiful on this shirt and it is true to size. it is very comfortable but i wish the flowing part on top was pinned under arms or something. it is attached at the top of the tank top but nowhere else so it just kind of lays over the tank with a poncho look.i also think the top layer would look better if it was longer- it hits at my natural waist and i'm petite. i still plan on keeping it and think it will be cute enough with jeans. just really wanted to love it!
1,Amazing pair of leggings! The fabric is super soft and the quality is just exceptional. the pattern/coloring is even more beautiful in person. overall an excellent pair of leggings to work out in or run errands in.
1," I just got these leggings yesterday and honestly they're amazing. they look just like the picture, feel great on, don't slip in the waist. zero negatives. i can't wait to wear these bad boys out."
1, A little long but very comfortable. i've worn it to work and to a bridal shower so very versatile.
1,"Scottish classic Received this jacket yesterday...and it is lovely.
very well made with a relaxed yet feminine fit.
the cobalt blue accents are not as vivid as they appear online, was slightly disappointed with that, but being more subtle will make it more wearable...so no ""oh she is wearing that jacket again""....
the forest green is rich and elegant.
the fit is true to size, but this is not a fitted jacket, it falls more straight, but the peplum is a gorgeous accent. 
a classic with impeccable quality!"
1," This sweater is very long, could be worn as a dress at 5'3 !"
1,"Ginerva maxi I purchased a large and it fit perfect. i'm a size 12- 36dd. the material is very forgiving and flows over my curves. thick enough that it doesn't need a slip and will stretch to fit size 14 ladies, maybe size 16 too. i'm 5'7"" and the length is great on me with flat sandals. doesn't show my bra either."
1," Color not as vibrant as in the picture. skirt is darted, which is not clearly seen in the picture. (assumed would be cut on the bias, which i'm more familiar with in slip dresses.) i didn't fill in the bust and the style is such that it isn't possible to compensate with helpful undergarments. while not for me, i'm still recommending it because it may fit others better. reviewers are instructed to avoid writing about customer service, but i feel compelled to note that the customer service i have"
1,"Unique and comfortable top, easy to wear. I love the beading at the neck of this top and also the half-length banded sleeves. it is a dressy top that is nevertheless very comfortable to wear. it looks like silk although it is synthetic. i do wish it came in a petite length because it is a bit long for me, but it is one of those pieces you can just put on over a variety of pants or skirts and you're done and ready for work or going out to an event. it requires little in the way of accessories because the beading at the neck acts as built"
1,"Get compliments all the time Love this fun print. one of the most complimented items in my closet! i ordered petite after trying on the regular - regular was a bit too long for the look in the models photo. i am 5'5, size 0/2 usually. the blue has faded a little bit the pants have maintained their fun and funky vibe."
1,Jury is still out Perhaps i purchased the wrong size. i will return to a store and try on the small. the medium just looks a little sloppy on me. i absolutely love the length and the color. will likely exchange for a smaller size and wear it all spring and summer.
1,"Nice dress I love this dress, the only issue is i ordered on-line and it came from a store location not the warehouse so it came dirty on the bottom and wrinkled! 
once i washed it (yes its washable) it looked fantastic!!!"
0,"Proportions are off I really liked the color and style of this dress, but the proportions were off. the top was too small and the waist was too large. if you are more uniform in size/shape and less of an hourglass this dress may be perfect for you!"
1,"Floral fun! I absolutely love these jeans! the rise is mid so it is perfect, not too low and not too high. the embroidered flowers are gorgeous and so unique. these pants scream retailerpolgie to me. i had to buy them as soon as i saw them because i know they will go fast. pilcro denim fits great! i ordered these online as my store didn't have them. i ordered my normal size 26 (2) and they fit great. i have an athletic build and they fit me like a glove with comfy room. i can't wait till the temperature gets"
1,"Beautifully unique top I was looking for a top to wear out that was chic but not too dressy. this top fit the bill. the sleeves and the embellishments give it a very feminine touch. i paired it with skinny black ankle pants and black heels and received lots of compliments. it is comfortable and easy to wear for a long night out. it does run big so i recommend sizing down. also, the sides are slightly sheer but i wore a black tank underneath without a problem. great top!"
1,Comfortable but not for extreme yogis This bra is incredibly comfortable but not meant for practices that involve a lot of movement (i.e.: vinyasa) but is perfect for lounging and personal practice. the orange is a beautiful color
0,Print looks odd This is a well made blouse with a pretty neckline. the print with the sleeves makes me look really wide. it's an odd look.
1,"Wearable art Love, love, love these leggings! a soft, colorful, comfortable way to show your artistic flare."
1,"Floral fall jean Pilcro denim with embellishment like this always wins me over. these pair of jeans fit well, the detail is so pretty for fall. cant wait until it cools off to wear these. the price point is a little high considering the silly shipping costs too. love the jeans though."
1,"Elegant! I know the photos for this dress show it as a very ""casual"" dress, but i find it very elegant.i really love this dress. it is very simple, but that is what makes it stunning. . the fabric is heavy enough to drape perfectly. it fits really nice on top - my bra fits just fine underneath and doesn't show. i'm a short gal and i will have to wear a small heel even though i purchased an xxs petite. i'm fine with that. nice quality, fits well - done deal for me!"
1,Amazing fabric I'm in love with these leggings. they are super soft and comfortable. they look cute on and are great for working out or even running errands. very stylish too!
1,Love !! Love this dress - haven't worn it yet but wow the design / artwork of the fabric is beautiful !! waiting for weather to cool off a bit so can wear with my off white suede gogo boots ....
1,Bee-utiful Love this top! i typically wear a 4-6 and went with the 6 on this one. the length was better and the the buttons were perfectly closed. i am a 34d. this top looks great with everything.
1, I found this tee to run true to size with a comfortable relaxed fit. the neckline and elegant button gives this tee enough detail to dress it up if you wanted to take it in that direction.
1,"Fun for fall I love this dress. i ordered the small, i am 5'2"" and 116ibs. the dress fell right at my knee cap. i had it altered in length 2"" and now it looks great. i was a little concerned about having to cut off some of the print design elements, but it didn't effect the look ."
1,Love it buy it! Im size 16 top and the xl is a little big but it is a longer tshirt whihc i love thank you sooo much please return the size large back...
1,"Didn't fit right It is a beautiful dress,but didn't fit me.this is better for someone tall and thin."
1,"Adorable Now, i ordered both striped versions and i don't know which to keep... the material is a nice soft knit. the neck line is almost boat-neck, with little buttons, so cute. colors are really nice too. i tried it on with skinnies and trousers,a nd ti looked great with both. i went with the petite version, for those shorter gals out there... xxs petite fit me, i havne't tried o the xs petite yet. (5'1.5"" and 115 lbs). i think it would loke nice with a pencil skirt too, if i only had one that went wit"
1,"Cute and nice cut This is a nice sleeveless button down, the bee design is really fun, but the colors make this more stylish than i would have thought. i tried it on with a pair of white shorts, with a half tuck, and it looked great. i can also see it paired with trousers or flared jeans. nice addition. i purchased the 0 (or xs?) my usual size, in regular length, and it was fine. the stylist also showed me how to tied it in the front to wear with high waisted pants. i am 115 lbs for reference and 30 dd."
1,"The perfect fall sweater Nice quality, can work as a jacket or sweater. i've worn with and without the tie. i didn't realize from the pictures but the sleeves bell out giving it an extra touch."
1,"Elegant and comfortable I purchased the navy breton stripe version of this shirt. it's chic, versatile, and soft, a great rendition of a wardrobe classic."
1,"Loved the fabric Loved the fabric of this dress, and the slip that comes with it. i wish the waist line fit a little better though. i am 5'4"" with an athletic build and it looked really boxy on me. i was so disappointed. thought i could synch it in to make it work, but think this is a return."
0,Nice but wrong fit The material is awesome and it's a super pretty dress it just didn't work on my body.
0,"Drab color, weird fit Couldn't make it work, even belted. ivory color is darker irl--dingy light tan, like dirty vintage. ""drop"" waist is not dropped at all, just a maternity-ish cut that starts boxy-loose high up (below bust), then abruptly flares out at bellybutton level (not low hip) into the skirt. i usually find a-line cuts good at giving illusion of a willowy, curvy waist, but this does not--adds ten pounds. poly fabric heavy/hot; rayon lining awkward and doesn't flow/drape. (5'3'' 127lb 34a, tried xs)"
1," Love! i wish this came in additional motifs! hits at hip, i have a long torso, perfect for high rise skinny jeans and sandals."
1,"Beautifully made I bought this mainly because i have a similar one in the mustard colorway and i love how this flows. the color is definitely one you don't see a lot of, which is what makes it special. i could see it running a tad large, but i think it's pretty true to size. now i'm debating about buying it in blush!"
1,"Fun and unique I am 5' 4"" and 128 lbs and could have worn the 4 or 6 but took the 6. it does run short and the length in the 6 was better than the 4 with arm hole size being the same. the bees are embroidered making the fabric high quality and normally i would run from a print like this but not this one. it has great style!"
1,Love this dress! I really love this dress. i cannot believe how many people have complimented me on this dress and ask where i bought it. the color is so soft and pretty. the dress is comfortable as well. it looks great with a light pair of wedges.
1,"So soft I bought this shirt in the teal/navy and loved it so much that i went back and bought the white/navy too. it is so soft! the shirt runs a little tight but is stretchy and not uncomfortable. the sleeve length and neckline dress up this shirt a little bit from being a standard t shirt, yet it is just as comfortable. overall very cute and flattering."
1,"Unique,colorful but has some flaws Love the colors in this autumn designed sweater that i just received but it has to be returned. i disagree with one of the reviews that it is not as pictured as far as the green being ""off."" i think it is just as pictured. i love the texture of the large pockets and belt with the suede feel. i love the flap on the back. what i don't like is how large it is. i have never worn an xs from retailer and i should have listened to the advice from the previous reviews but i didn't. 
i could send it back"
0,"Awkward shape, cute fabric I'm 5'3"" about 130lbs and ordered a size 6. the print on the fabric is as expected but the shape of the dress and fit were not good at all. i probably would wear a 4 instead of the 6, but could tell that even if i had the 4, the cut of it still wouldn't be flattering on me at all. it was baggy in odd places and had no shape. the outer fabric is very sheer and see through and the lining is nice, with a fitted slip design."
0,"Too shimmery! I saw that there was metallic detail when i ordered it, but i wasn't prepared for the entire thing to be metallic. it fit tts, but wasn't what i was looking for."
1,"Lingerie? Fabulous fabric, adorable details. fitting is very, very odd. it's non-adjustable in any way. the fabric has no stretch at all around the middle and the underwire of the bra is very stiff which i found painful. the straps were kind of loose, but there is no way to tighten them because of the frills. when i bent over, the shorts exposed the bottom of my butt. i'd get a larger size, but then i can't adjust the straps and they would definitely be too long and leave my breasts very exposed. overall,"
1,Yummy t I love the raw edges on this t-shirt and the marled pink is a pretty color. the fit is not as oversized as you might expect from the photos. order your usual size. it's very soft and lightweight.
1,"Versatile boatneck top I tried the red/salmon color on at the store. it's a very bright color, but a nice one. the top is form-fitting, with soft stretchy material. there are two small buttons at each shoulder. the sleeves are a good length. the boatneck shows a little bit of bra strap, but not too noticeable. the only thing i didn't care for was the somewhat synthetic look of the material. if you're between sizes, size up as it's a snug fit."
1,"Versatile top but size up! Fun versatile top for casual wear with capris, denim, or shorts/skirts. purchased both striped versions. love ballet necklines. the 3/4 length sleeve is wonderful for spring, summer, fall in california. the top is fitted yet it runs small. be sure to sized up. i normally wear xs, however this was way too tight. so i've ordered a small in both. hoping it works perfectly."
1,"Sizing up wasn't necessary for me... I ordered a size up after reading the reviews, but i wouldn't of had to. it's not a snug fit at all. although, i am fairly small busted. soft fabric with a little stretch that will be great for lounging around the house or running errands."
1,All the buzz This is so awesome. i love how it fits. it's great quality. it's flattering. it's casual but put together. love. fits true to size. i bought it in white as well.
1,"Beautiful, unique dress I bought this dress on super sale online after seeing it in the store. the pattern is just so beautiful and unique! i think it looks much pretty in person than online. there isn't a lot of shape to the dress but i like the loose style and can see this being worn with boots/booties. it also looks nice with a belt! my only complaint is i had to size down to a 6 (usually an 8-10 in dresses) and the liner slip was a little tight. also would have loved to try this in petite. the regular falls to just"
1,"Cute, printed blouse! This blouse is very cute and will be great for summer casual wear! so cute in this print - it looks great with colored crop pants!

it is a bit tough to get the right fit in this top, depending on your preference. i usually wear a size 2-4 in tops (26"" waist, 34b/c), but went with a 0 in this because it just felt wide otherwise. also, i am fine with it, but this blouse seems to be somewhat short in the torso. if you are particular, possibly buy in store because the pattern of bees varies quite"
1,"Great casual cardigan Beautiful cardigan, but it does run large.  i'm about 5'9"", 160 lbs, normally a large in tops, and the medium fits great. it's still a bit roomy, but i think this cardigan is meant to be a tad roomy.  i agree with another reviewer that it's a bit itchy on bare skin, but it's wool, so that's a given.  overall, a great cardigan for fall!"
1,"Best if tied at waist Love the fabric of this button-down. runs really large, however. am usually a small or xs - so bought a 4. it's ok, but is incredibly boxy and stands away from the body -- & not in a good way. i think it probably works well tied at the waist, but, alas -- i am too old to be showing off that part of my anatomy. returned reluctantly! hope others will enjoy!"
1,"Perfect oversize t It's the perfect long, loose t-shirt. flattering without being fitted. love it!"
1,"Bumble bees This is such a cute top. i bought it when it was a new arrival and couldn't be more thrilled. it washes well in the the washing machine. the only flaw is that it runs on the short side. otherwise, i'm thrilled."
1,"Looooong. 1. i'm 5'6"" tall with a short waist and long legs, and this skirt came all the way down to my ankles. i would have kept it if it had stopped mid-calf like in the photo.

2. i'm 38-32-40 and the size 12 fit me perfectly in the waist hip area, so i would say it runs true to size.

3. the buttons lay nice and flat over the tummy, so that's a plus. at least you don't have to undo them to go to the bathroom."
1,"Nice sweater I purchased the cedar one. not sure where they got color name from since i don't see any cedar in it. the picture of the model is accurate in coloring and fit. tts, the sleeves are a little wider and longer at bottom but in a good way (to me). the pockets and belt are a suede-like material which makes for a lovely detail. it's not a slender-izing piece but not a frumpy fit imo at all. soft material and nicely made, but for that price i would hope so."
0,"Not great This has a cute aesthetic on the hanger but not so great on- at least for my body type. i am 5'10"" with broad shoulders and slim, and both the arms and dress length were too short. in addition, the size 8 was boxy and unflattering. sizing down to a 6 would have exacerbated the length issues."
1,Slenderizing sweater I'm 5'1 and a tad busty and this sweater i found to be most flattering. i saw it i. the store on was drawn to it. i love the shimmer but perhaps that's because the holiday feel is already in the air in nyc. the m fit great in both length pans width. it looked great with my straight black jeans and boots. i felt it made me look thin. thankful i bought it on a discount day! it's a fabulous sweater.
1, Beautiful shirt for a great price. i love a good striped shirt and i got it on sale!
1, So cute! a definite add for this summer. sizing and pattern are both on-point. would be cute with so many bottoms
1, The sleeves are a bit too voluminous and the solid color collar stands out a bit too much.  but it's a cute pattern and style.  very comfortable.
1,Nice white tunic This is a nice tunic but i wish it was a bit more structured. the band in the back helps hold it together so it doesn't balloon out but a few more pin tucks would have been nice. i do like the length and style as a alternate to a white button down shirt and it looks super cute with skinny crop pants.
1,"Pretty but runs large This sweater was in-store in a more neutral color palette and was so pretty. when i tried it on i noticed a few things: the versatility and quality are definitely there - this is a nice piece even at full-price. the downside is that it runs very large. i'm typically a 14/16 and a size xl in most retailer items, and even the large was a bit roomy. the other thing was that the sleeves of this sweater are pretty long (and i have long arms). due to the bell cut of the sleeve you couldn't even really c"
1,"Oversized Beautiful 100% lambswool sweater with all these gorgeous fall colors arranged into an eye catching design. i agree with reviewer numero uno, she is correct on all counts: pretty colors, quality construction, ultra long bell sleeves (look at model wearing cedar/neutral colorway), oversized fit. sizing down will still have those ridiculously long sleeves but i'm fine with that. i ordered size m and will exchange for a s as the cardigan is too large overall. wool is soft and just a bit itchy which"
1,"Jungle boogie This dress brought out my tamed inner kitty--there's a collar so of course it's tamed! i'm in love with this unique print that roars retailer to all who admire. this is not a hot weather dress because of long sleeves and fabric. dropped stars cuz it's yucky poly/rayon and you need to size down or you'll be drowning in fabric (this cat doesn't swim!) looks great belted or underneath my black wool sweater. i'm 5'3"" 135# 36c and i purchased size 8."
1,"Four winters in... a winner! I love this coat. i bought it in 2012, and it still looks great in 2015. i only wear it a few times each season, but it makes me smile. it's tailored, feminine, and a bit flashy. it's fairly warm, too."
1,"A special piece Upon entering a local retailer store, i saw this top almost instantly and decided to try it on. 
fyi: 36c, broad shoulders/back, high waist, 5'3"" (almost), and i normally wear a 12 in a fitted, button-up shirt. i can go down to a 10 in a loose-fit one, but with the buttons i wouldn't expect this to be ""loose-fitting"". i wear a m or l in a knit top. i tried this on in 12, but it was too big in the armholes and chest, causing the top to stand out too much from my body. when i tried on the 10, these"
1,"So ready for fall! I received this dress today and can not be happier. i'm 5'6"", 120 lbs, 34c, and the 2 fits perfectly, hitting about 1.5"" above my knees. the print is so pretty and elegant. the colors aren't too vibrant, aren't too muted. the collar and french cuffs give the dress an extra flair. it comes with a little slip because the dress is sheer. i just tried it on with suede booties and it looks adorable! i'm ready for cooler temps to arrive so i can wear it!"
1,For work or play Got the blue & white striped in xs. fits perfectly. the arms are a little snug but it stretched to a comfortable fit. it's very comfy and good quality fabric.
1,"Effortlessly pretty So much prettier in person than online. the animal print isn't in your face, but subtle enough for almost any occasion. the button-up collar and slightly past knee length make it work for a casual work environment. the pleats and airiness of the dress remind me of kate middleton in anita dongre. 

fit: 5'4"", 140 pounds - i bought a six, but the four would probably work as well. because of the lightness of the fabric, the extra fabric doesn't overwhelm my small frame. goes slightly past my knee"
1,"Even better than expected! This dress is so much prettier in person! it will be great both for work and play, can't wait to pair with booties into fall."
1,"Prettier in person I got this dress in the mail today, and it's one of the best dresses i've ever gotten at retailer.. the material is of high quality and feels silky against the skin. the fit is true to size for maeve, and is so flattering. for reference, i'm thin (116 lbs), but curvy and usually order a regular xs. in maeve, i'm usually an xsp, and the xsp fit perfectly. it looks good with a wide cream colored crocheted belt (also from retailer), or on its own."
1,"Absolutely elegant. This dress is beautiful and very flattering! i bought the 8 and am 5'3"" and 138lbs. it fits right at the knee and is flowy, but still gives some shape without looking baggy. i love it!"
1,"Busty gals rejoice! stripes! I am busty and have a difficult time wearing stripes because they are not that flattering. the stripes on this top are narrow, and the material is thin which makes this great to wear under a jacket if you want to dress it up. i am 5 feet tall and ordered both the regular small and the ps because i wasn't sure which sleeves would be best on me (as far as the length goes.) if you want the sleeves to look like they do on the model order the petite if that's what you usually order. you can also get"
0,Sweater is huge!! Had to return. ordered an xs which usually fits perfect. 34b chest and it was falling off. shoulders and chest!! it was like a sleeping bag. huge fan of retailer but there is a design flaw in this sweater.
1,"Cute & cozy What a great sweater! the pale pink is sweet but the grey was more my style. i'm 5'5"" 120 (34c) and the xs is perfect. i know everyone is saying this sweater runs large but i believe this style is meant to be a bit oversized, so i would call it true to size with that in mind. the arms are long, the shape is boxy (but not short) and i love the way it hangs on my thin frame. it's super soft & cozy; will easily be a go-to sweater this fall."
1,"Makes me feel young I love this sweater. it is so soft and the pink is such a sweet shade. it is large and falls of the shoulder, but that's how it is designed to fit. it is my new favorite sweater!"
1,"Beautiful and perfect I am so happy with this dress. i bought my usual size 2, and it was a perfect fit. this dress is gorgeous. it has some stretch, which is a plus. i am 5'5 "", and it was not too long on me at all. i am so thrilled with my purchase."
0,"Cute but bad shape I bought this sweater online as soon as i saw it. but like the other reviewers i agree it is shapeless and sticks out too much at and below the waist. if it were a softer fabric maybe the flair would work but not for this one. i am 5' 2"", 115lbs, 32d and got the xs. maybe if you aren't chesty it won't flare out as much. sadly i had to return it. i was so excited for it, o well."
1,Lovely transitional dress I a looking forward to wearing this dress with a jean or leather jacket. the dress is well made and the fringe adds a nice detail to the otherwise basic design. be sure to order a couple of sizes smaller than your regular size because the dress is huge. i ordered the dress in both colors and am keeping the blue.
0,"Big and boxy As previously mentioned, this dress runs very large. i ordered accordingly, and the small was the right size for my frame, but it was just not flattering. i'm pear shaped, and i found the shoulders to be large, the neck a bit too high, and the overall cut to hug my figure in a very unflattering way. i'm 5'4"", 140-ish, and maybe if i were a few pounds lighter and a few inches taller, it could've worked. i so wanted to love this, because it's soft and comfortable and cute, but back it goes."
1,"Mustard color I wanted the blight yellow as photo with navy flower motifs. however it was much more darker as on the tag, mustard. if you like its color you will like it."
1,Super comfy Love this sweater. super comfy. can wear with everything.
1, This dress is more beautiful in person. loved it . fits true to size . i had to return it because it was to long for what i needed.
1,Must have for summer Chic and comfortable even in 90 degree heat. so easy to wear.
0,Cute but too short The model looks like she's 14 years old - this sweater of course would fit a younger teen. it definitely won't work for a grown woman. please make some longer sweaters.
1,"Very nice, just as pictured Very nice sweater, surprisingly just as pictured color-wise, i ordered a large and it felt true to size in the shoulders, but this sweater flair out to the bottom, you can kind of see it in the photo, the length is good as well for a regular fit. it's very unique combination of fabric acrylic/wool knit, the texture is really nice and soft and looks very good on. also it's thick and warm. i wore the top to work today on 34 degree weather and received many compliments. sweater looks simple but the"
1,"Flattering and lightweight duster I bought this lightweight duster in the cream color. it runs a little large through the shoulders so i sized down from my usual l to a size m. its very flattering on, and made with natural fibers such as cotton and linen. i wear this unbuttoned with a tank top, cropped jeans, and sandals."
1,"Lovely! I'm 5.5"", 128 lbs, 34b cup, slender throughout, size 2 fit perfectly. lightweight, flattering dress. bought on sale to wear next year to baby/bridal shower type event."
1,"Perfect spring goddess dress I just received this dress and i feel like a goddess in it! it is perfect for graduations, weddings, romantic dinners, tropical va cations....heck, i'll wear it to the grocery store! i love it that much!

i am 5'7"" with a 34c bust.....i have this dress in a size 4 and it fits very well. this dress is slim cut from the shoulder down to the waist. the dress length hits me at the lower calf, just like the model online. i think the armholes are cut a little high...this being said; this dress would"
1,"Great sweater This sweater works on many levels for petite frames. the length is just right, hitting at the lower waist. the design is very pretty, feminine and with flair."
0,"Boxy This sweater was unflattering me, very boxy and did not fall on me like the model. soft fabric and looks nice off, however this one went back."
1,"Sizing and fit are off Absolutely love the print and quality is great too! unfortunately, for a well endowed woman like myself, it runs terribly small in the bust and hip region. it absolutely does not look as flowy on an hourglass body type. too bad because it's beautiful! might try sizing up but doubt it will work :("
1,"Classy! I wanted this top since the first time i saw it. it fits perfectly in a small, as i usually wear a small or medium. it would probably fit better if you are smaller on top -i am a 36a- as it is not generously sized. it flares at the bottom, which looks quite flattering. the lace on the sleeves really adds a lot of style. i will wash it carefully, as i am not sure how well the lace will hold up with washing. this is a beautiful top, and i am considering buying another in a different color. i think"
1," This dress was so cute and comfortable! i said it runs big, but i think that may also simply be the style of it. i paired it with some cute boots and received many compliments! love it!!"
0,Made me look larger than i am This sweater did not flatter a sz 12 with 36d chest. it's very well made but not for the curvy girl. this is my very first review and felt compelled to share my thoughts since i heavily rely on others' reviews before i purchase.
1,"In love with these pants! I've been searching high and low for a pair of flattering and comfortable linen pants. i'm very particular and have turned down every pair until these. these are perfect! they fit true to size. they are a relaxed, but not baggy cut. (i hate saggy butt pants!) the legs are slightly tapered so they don't widen my frame. they look great rolled up or left down. the linen is soft, not scratchy. the elastic band sits comfortably on my waist. they are also not see through! (a must for me!) i ordered th"
1,"A great anti-jean for hot summer weather! Yay hei hei! love these pants. thanks to the roll-up, they show a nice bit of ankle. lightweight but sturdy?i've been reaching for them when it just seems too hot for jeans. they're a little poufy toward the top (below the waist), but the tie waist makes them sufficiently cinchable. i expect to get a lot of wear out of these this summer. i did experience some stretching/sagging after a full day of walking, moving, and sitting, so i bought my second pair in m instead of l. (got navy and went back"
1,"Runs very big I ordered the red in xs petite, xxs and xxs petite (in case petite was too short). so far, the xs petite and xxs petite were shipped to me, however, thought the bag said petite, the actual dresses inside were regular sizes, and they were huge, even the xxs (i put it on on top of another knit dress and it was big0. so i reordered, this time only the xxs petite (though i am technically waiting for the xxs regular)... perhaps all the bags have been switched... we shall see, but perhaps this isn't t"
1,"Just ok for mw I love the pattern, but the color was not great on my skin tone. i tried on the regular size and it wasn't great. teh cut could work, but overall, i didn't feel like it was enough for me to order the petite to see, and i sometimes do. in a tall darker toned person, this would be gorgeous. what i like the most is the color pattern in the print, and shimmer."
1,"Fun, elegant, stops others Recently wore this lovely dress during business trip - was stopped four times while walking thru orlando airport. the design is extremely comfortable, the print will make you and others smile. so elegant and fun. the beading on the flowers is elegant. such a unique piece"
1,"Great pant for the price Buy these, they are a keeper. sturdy fabric, not too thin and they do not sag or stretch after wearing (i tested them before taking the tag off by sitting in them on my couch for several hours). comfy, soft fabric. i will be ordering other colors, hoping that black will be available."
0,Another example of retailer quality going downhill.. These pants look nice and are comfortable but the quality of the fabric is terrible! i should not be surprised because i bought another pair of pants by this same label at antro earlier this year and they did not hold up at all either. but i thought i'd give it another shot. never again! i'm on my 5th wear and the crotch and inner thighs have worn away completely...i mean huge holes in the fabric where it's just disintegrated. even at extra % off the sale price it's not worth it. the full price
1,"Soft, stylish sweater dress! love it! This is simply a fabulous dress. i think the issue with the other reviewers is that they are too small (though there is nothing wrong with that). i am not. i am older and heavier, and the dress fits very well. i'm also rounder on the bottom so it is not baggy or tent-like. the material and texture of the yarn is soft and comfortable. you can wear it all day at the office and into the evening. it looks great with a jean jacket, for example, and booties. and it also looks terrific with flats. it d"
1,"Dreamy dress! This dress is a lovely creation! however, i had to buy it three times before finding the proper fit. it runs extremely large!! i am 5'4"", weighing around 128. i ordered a 4 petite the first time because others stated this dress ran small. ha! it was a sack!!! the 2 petite was little better. the 0 petite was perfect! but i have never worn a 0 petite in my entire life!

otherwise, this dress is an original that i will enjoy for many years to come! if only it had been made of silk, it would be un"
1,"Flattering and darling I ordered this dress in navy for fall, and it is now easily the most darling and figure flattering dress in my wardrobe. i am 125 lbs and size 27 in jeans. i usually wear a size small but ordered a medium based on reviews that said this dress runs small, and i like that the medium is a little longer and slightly blousy, making it more modest, but the small would have worked just fine for a slightly more figure-accentuating look. the fabric hangs beautifully and has a silky feel. the navy flower"
1,"Beautiful sweater I bought this sweater in the black. it is so flattering and feels great on. the sleeves are a bit long, but they are supposed to be. the material is not overly thick, yet it feels soft and well made. while the lace sleeves are the star of this show, the back is so flattering! it has a perfect cut that i don't think comes through in the picture. it fits true to size. love this one!!!!"
1,"Didn't work for me but a beautiful sweater I ordered the ivory in size xl. it fit a little on the small side. the knit was good quality as was the lace. unfortunately, the mock neck was stiff and uncomfortable. the sleeves were a little too long for me as well so i returned it. but, it's such a unique style and good quality."
1,"The perfect summer pant It is rare that i find a pair of pants that works for me at retailer. as a woman with curves i have found that most of retailer's pants are cut for slim figured women, this rare pair of pants crosses the divide, flattering both shapes. i usually have to look for xls. here, i found that i had too much room and sized down to a l. these pants are great. they are lightweight without being so gauzy that they highlight imperfections. they will be my go to summer pant. i love them."
1,"Gorgeous! It's stunning in person. delicate beading detail on bodice isn't visible in the photo but really dresses it up. fits lovely but runs small. i am usually a 6 or 8, ordered the 8 and it just fits. fully lined. bought it to attend a wedding and i'm very pleased with it."
1,"Perfect fall sweater! I love drop shoulder sweaters and find them to be very flattering so i took a chance on this one despite the reviews stating it runs very large. i was attracted to the style as well as the natural cotton fiber, which i find holds up best over time. i am 34b and usually wear xs or small and in this i ordered the xs. it fits perfectly! i layered this soft pink sweater over a rounded hem tee with a black and white pattern; so cute! it is slightly short on my 5'8"" frame so the shirt tail hems peeked"
1,"Great pants for the summer I've been looking for comfortable pants for the summer.  this pants is the answer.  it's comfortable, thin, and yet not to sheer.  this pants a bit loose, i could fit in s.  i usually buy size 8 or 10 for shorts from retailer, so i'll say this pants run big.  the con with this pants is the stitching around the back pockets is not very sturdy.  i found tiny holes on 2 other pairs before i bought mine."
1,"Love! I bought this is in the gray color, although imo it has more of a greenish hue. i love it. it's a wide boxy fit like others have said, and tends to fall off the shoulder. i purchased it in the small (my typical size) and it definitely seems to run large (it relaxes too as i wear it, giving it an even roomier feel). that said it's very cozy & comfortable. i wear a tank underneath. works well for 50's and 60's weather."
1,"Fabulous fabulous fabulous This is a perfect sweater. it's comfortable, practical and lends an elegant hand to a pair of jeans. it also hides your bits and stays flattering. i have worn it a lot because it makes life so easy and i have not had any issues yet with lace tearing.

tts. 5'7"" 127 lbs 34b wearing this in size small"
0,"No Bummer, i loved the lacy bell arms and everything about the look of this sweater but it is huge in the abdomen. seriously looks maternity to me. the neck is also too wide. the quality of the material is very nice and the weight is nice and heavy but the cut just didn't work on me. i returned this one."
1,"So comfy These pants are so great, light, comfortable and reasonably priced. they are very well made, and the soft fabric is perfect for summer traveling and hiking. there's a bit of elastic in the waist which i like since pants usually gap at the waist on me. they're like classier lounge pants."
1,"Beautiful, romantic dress Don't wait. get this dress now before it disappears. it is gorgeous, it is well made. it is like butter. the fit is perfect and the workmanship is stunning. everything about this screams, ""lets go party!."" oh yeah... and the skirt part kind of swishes around as you dance. you cannot get more charming than this."
0,Large and boxy Good reason to read reviews. i concur with others in that it fins large and looks boxy. heavy fabric makes matters worse.
1,"Great dress I ordered the small and it fits ok,i probably could have went with an xs but i am keeping the dress.it is a very beautiful dress.this dress can be worn for casual or dressed up for evening.very versatile dress and well made.i did get it on sale which made it very affordable. i am only 5'3"" and the length in the regular s is fine for me."
1,"Amazing quality I am 5'8 and 220lbs (extremely muscular) i ordered a size large and it hangs very nicely over my curves, the neckline looks pretty good with my broad shoulder, and the dress comes about 4 inches above my knee. i think people with curves would really like this dress but it does lack shape so beware if you're looking for something with some structure. the blue is gorgeous and the fringe details are very cute. this dress does seem to run a bit big."
1,Love the lace This is a gorgeous sweater! i purchased it in black and purple.
1,"Love it! I was looking for something business casual when i ran into this dress in store. i was able to wear a petite small, but am normally a 4-6 in dresses. it does run large! its perfect with heels for work or dressed down with boots in the fall. it is very comfortable and still looks like you're trying."
1,"Beautiful! I bought this dress to wear to my graduation where i was receiving a degree in horticulture. i also just had a child a few weeks prior and was worried about sizing. the high waist worked well for the post pregnancy belly. i am 5'3"" and was typically around 130 lbs pre-pregnancy which was typically a 4 in dresses. i ordered a 6 petite in this dress and it was perfect! the only area that was sort of tight was the bosom but i am nursing so i expected as much. the petite length was perfect for my he"
0,"Over too bit While i loved the sleeves on this sweater (the lace detailing was beautiful) the core area was really big. i agree with another reviewer who said it looked like a maternity top. i was hopeful but i sent it back. i am 5'7"", 128lb and ordered the small."
1," Absolutely beautiful, i am extremely happy with this purchase. i bought this top a couple of months ago and have worn it many times. initially, i was a little apprehensive to order due to some of the other reviews but i found that this top is very figure flattering. it is very soft and warm and i am positive it will be in my wardrobe for quite a few years to come. i am almost sad that i will have to put it away for the season soon."
1,"Glad i went for it!! I loved the look and style of the dress but was unsure how it would work with my body. i'm curvy but slim and usually a size 6 or 8 in retailer. i went with the m in the navy color, and i'm happy i did! 
the floral pattern is vibrant and the ruffled skirt is flirty and fun. as far as fit goes, i'd say this runs mostly true to size but is rather short in length. i have a large chest so the top part looked more baggy than blousy, and the skirt portion was just comfortably fitted. however, the cuten"
0,"Too large, no shape While i loved the material, color and concept of the dress, it was much too large and sack-like. i'm 5'2"" and 108 lbs, pear-shaped. i purchased the regular xs given stated length in the description. while the length was just right, it was just much too large throughout. i'm not sure that even an xxs will help so sadly, this will be going back."
1,Fabulous! This sweater is even better looking in person. the body of the sweater is substantial - a nice weight. the lace is gorgeous. i usually wear a size large but found the sleeves really long. i purchased a medium and it fits better - sleeves are perfect.
1,"Runs way too large - so bummed to return! This is a great dress - nice soft fabric and the red is a nice, vibrant tomato red color.  i ordered a small - i am 5'4"" and usually wear a 4 in dressed.  this dress was so huge - it might be mismarked but labeled a small.  i will have to return it - not even my seamstress can make it fit!"
1,"Beautiful unusual sweater Love the lace cut out detail on the sleeves which is initially what attracted me to this sweater. just be careful with the threads. the sleeves are long but are supposed to be, as in the photo. comfortable material with nice weave, flattering cut. i bought the ivory color in xs for my 5'2"" 115 # straight frame. not too long"
1,"Awesome sweater Love, love, love this sweater. it is so comfy and well made. this is a piece i will have for a very long time. the beautiful lace detail are the sleeves are to die for. picture doesn't do this sweater justice."
0,"Good fabric quality, poorly shaped I agree with the other reviewers; this sweater was strangly shaped in the waist, in an unflattering way. the rest of it was beautiful though. looks too much like maternity, even in a petite xs, so it's going back."
1,"Beautiful and unique but the fit is not the best I love this sweater and the sleeves are amazing. i also love the purple color, which is more of a deep maroon. the material seems to be of good quality. what i don't love about this sweater is the shape. it is very swingy, which is somewhat flattering because it isn't too clingy, but it poofs out a bit too much on the sides, becoming unflattering from certain angles."
0,"Lovely summer print, runs small This is a beautiful skirt; the colors are fresh and summery, yet subtle, and it's a nice sturdy cotton, not flimsy and cheap looking. however, i agree with the reviewer who said that this runs small. i take a 4 in most skirts, but i had to try on a 6 and still felt that it didn't fit quite right. if you're extremely thin, this might be great for you."
1, Love love love!!! it is a little boxy but it is soo soft and comfortable!! it does run at least a size or 2 big!! i picked it up in the pink color yesterday at me local retailer store. was not sure about it when i first saw it online but fell in love with it quickly when i tried it on!!  great sweater for fall/winter
1,"Nice shirt, wrong body type This shirt is beautiful, however i thought that it was made of a softer, lighter material. it is, instead, made of a thick, heavy material that was unflattering for my shape. ( short torso ann's large bust) it made me look boxy and chunky in the middle. sadly, i'll be returning"
1, I purchased the pale green in this sweater first. loved it so much i purchased in another color.
1,Comfortable-soft-lovely pattern Stunning sweater for cooler weather. i think it runs a little small so returned first one and ordered one size up which fits perfect.
1,"Love the style I ordered this online and i love the style, but didn't like the print as much as i thought i would."
1,"Lovely sweater This is a lovely sweater--unique, nicely made, though i found that it ran large for me. i was between a size xs and small, and neither one seemed just right so i ended up returning it. the small had the right length in the arms and torso, but was too wide in the torso and shoulders, and the xs was too short. bummer! also found that every single ivory one had stains or spots on them in my local store, not sure why. if i had been able to settle on the right size i probably would've kept it!"
1,Everything I ordered the navy in an xl although am generally a medium or large in tops. i sized up because it looked fitted and i think it was a good choice for me. it fits just like the model but the back droops a bit and the neck is wider. my bra is still covered in the back.  it fits perfectly in the waist and the elastic allows for some adjustment in placement. there's 2 layers of ruffles in the skirt portion. i'm 66 and was concerned it would be too young looking but i love the look. it hits about an
1,Cute socks Fun socks you will want to show off. design is printed on a relatively thin (trouser sock).
1,Great dress! I wanted to love this dress but sadly returned it.  i think it would be more appropriate for someone younger.  it runs very large but its not clingy so forgiving of anyone with chunkiness (such as myself).  i guess i just thought the blue was a little too unexciting (for me).
1,"Beautiful design Wore this & got many compliments. true to size, elegant."
1,"Perfect! These pants are really great! the fabric is soft, but substantial, and the fit is so comfortable. i bought the ""grey"" color - it's a very light grey, almost a stone color. it's a perfect neutral to wear with just about any top you may have. i love the deep front pockets and the elastic waist is an added bonus. i'm 5'5"", 124 lb. and purchased the small."
1,"Gorgeous print I already have some dresses similar to this, but i couldn't help getting this one, too. i love the flowers, bees, and ladybugs on the print! there is some shimmery beading on the neck and a few spots. i think i can wear this at work with the right cardigan/jacket, so i'll get more use out of it. it's a lovely light, floaty fabric that's nice for warmer weather."
1,"Darling; runs small I felt a review would be helpful for anyone between sizes. i am long, lean, and broad shouldered. i normally wear a m, but ordered a l. it still fits snug, so i've exchanged for an xl in order to get the drape, as pictured on the model. material and color of the red motif is darling; light as a feather & will take me spring through summer."
1,"So cute and comfy!! Slouchy, longer in the sleeves, a little cropped, great neckline, stylish.....these are just some of the reasons i absolutely love this sweater! i've been looking for a style like this for a long time. i went down a size because of the wide neckline and the fact that it is a bit oversized. i'm petite, 119 lbs., with a 32f bust size. i went with the grey, but i'm loving it so much i might pick one up in the pink. so comfy and cozy and chic!!"
1,Cute cute Beautiful sweater. i first bought it in black and loved it so much i bought it in burgundy. the burgundy one is longer and slightly bigger than the black one and they are both smalls. nice thing is i can wear the burgundy one with leggings. love the lace on the sleeves and the sweater is a nice weight.
1,Cute and comfy This dress runs very large. i am usually wear an xs but i had to get xxsp-runs large through the mid section and arm holes. very comfortable and super cute on.
1," Very high quality fabric and the fit is excellent. the skirt is stylish yet simple and very easy to wear as i feel i would have no trouble paring it with several different tops. it can easily be dressed up or down and is excellent for work. i got this on sale and am so glad, still, it is one of the few items actually worth the initial high price tag. great quality!"
1,"Love these! These pants are so comfy i'm getting a second pair. i ordered the olive color in a small/reg, im thinking of ordering the xs next time since they do stretch out a great deal as the day goes on. would definitely recommend these for sure. hope this review is helpful as i struggled with ordering petite or not. glad i didn't!"
1,"Cute but short length Loved everything about this sweater but the short length.  didn't notice in the pictures but the last one of the back of the model shows the length. it barely reached the very top of my jeans so would have to wear something under or i'd be flashing my stomach all the time.  worked a bit better with skirts, but still too cropped for my frame. wish it was 1-2"" longer in length and would have been a new fall favorite. really great color and design besides that. just make sure you are wanting the sh"
1,"Pretty skirt The skirt really is beautiful - the blue and coral are brighter in person than in the picture above. it's a nice lightweight material that feels quality, but has too much stretchy spandex in it for my tastes. i had the same problem as others - the skirt runs very small. i am usually a size 6, and while i could zip the 6 up, the skirt had those puckers that come from being a size too small."
1,"Great summer pants These are nice, comfortable summer pants that travel well. the material has a nice feel to it,lightweight, but not too thin. they are easy to wear with any summer top, and look just dressy enough. i like the elastic waist, but the pants will stretch out a bit, and run a little large."
1,"Stunning!! This dress is absolutely stunning!!! i'm 5 feet & curvy. it's flowy, lightweight & has some sparkle mixed in with the gorgeous print. it fit everywhere except when i got the zipper up to my chest. i'm a 36dd & it wasn't going to finish zipping. i was very sad! i even tried the biggest size they had - a 12 & it didn't work. if that zipper had been able to go all the way up & would own this dress."
1,Perfect summer to fall I bought this dress in burnt orange for my 19 year-old collage daughter. she loved it and has found many opportunities to wear it on campus. she said it is so comfortable and perfect with a sweater for cool fall mornings and sleeveless as the day warms up.
1, Love this romantic girlie girl dress. so pretty.
1,"Love this lightweight cardigan! I bought this duster in the blue color and really like it. i am 5'11"" so love the longer length. the large was too wide so got the medium. the sleeves were a little snug on my upper arms but after wearing it for awhile they loosened up. i think i will get the white too!"
1,"Stunninng Gorgeous sweater - such a simple design, but really stunning on. seems to be true to size. definitely a nice winter piece that's got a hint of ""dressy"" to it - maybe for date night. my only wish is that it didn't flair so much at the bottom (wish it was a bit more straight) - but other than that, i love it.
i'm approx 5' 5"" and about 125 lbs. i purchased the ""small""."
1,"Love this! I love this turtleneck! it's soft (cashmere blend), is sexy with the lace design and loose but form fitting style, and the 70s inspired sleeves are really flirty. i purchased it in two colors because i got so many compliments the first time around!"
1," I also agree that this piece ran very small. my normal size did not zip up. i sized up a size, and it pulled across my thighs. i sized up two sizes, and it fit as i had hoped it would. if you get the right size, it is beautiful on. the colors are so fun, and i love the side slit. i bought it to wear to work with a blouse or blazer, and it is definitely a statement piece."
1,"Love it! I bought this dress at my local retailer store on friday and love it! the dress is well made, with some heft to the yarn. the colors of the yarn, blue, white and grey, seem to shimmer a bit due to their weave, but there is no metallic thread in the dress that i can tell. i know some have written that the dress is a sack, but not on me. i toyed with buying this online and then didn't due to the negative comments about the dress; i bought an extra small and it fits well (i usually where an x small,"
1,"Lovely print and fabric design This dress was stunning on the hanger -- on me not so much. i am 5' 1.5"" and typically a sz 2. the smallest size at the store was a 4. i felt it was baggy about the waist and the length would have been better in petite sizing. the print is gorgeous with beading accenting different flowers. there is a tinge of green-yellow to the background fabric and the color did not look good on me. i hope to try this in a 4p."
1,"Love it! I love this cotton weave shift dress. it is supposed to be loose and not tight. i purchased a medium and fits the way i see it should fit. ref: 34dd, 148 lb; 5'4 height. hits above the knee but office appropriate as not too short. i paired it with a few seasons ago, the navy blue suede fringe jacket by retailer elevenses; new necklace in the blue motif from retailer ( it has a hanging druzy pendant) navy hose and navy crew neck long sleeve top.  great outfit for work and an after work party at retailer"
0,Poor quality This is another item i've been stalking that i thought miraculously made it to sale with my size still available. i ordered online but when it arrived i have to be honest i didn't even try it on because i knew it would be going back. the beautiful print online looks really cheap irl on the flimsy fabric. the beaded detail on neck is basically a low grade sequin trim. so much potential just executed poorly.
1," Very comfortable and attractive pullover. not too long or bulky, although i find myself rolling the sleeves up to keep them out of the way!

but it's a keeper"
0,"Only the sleeves are pretty; the rest is terrible The sleeves on this top always caught my eye every single time i was in a store. they never had my size to try on, so when a free shipping offer came up, i ordered the ivory top in a size large. well, the sleeves are indeed stunning, but that is all that is attractive about this top! the rest was a plain, blank, white canvas. in fact, that's what it felt like to wear it -- like i was wearing a tent or an artist's canvas on my chest. yuck! how can this designer put so much thought and care into t"
0,"Tight and cheap looking I went with my usual size, but it is too tight, it fits, but i would feel uncomfortable in it. i ordered the pink one, which looks nice in the picture, but in person, it looks cheap. the beading at the neckline immediately looked to me like cocktail dresses my grandma used to wear in the 1970s. that beaded neckline added to the cheap look. this one is not for me."
1,Beautiful romantic dress I love the look on this dress - feels great for a romantic night out or for a party.
0,"Pretty, but going back I just bought this and i really disagree with previous review that it runs big - i wear an 8 in skirts and bought another retailer skirt last week that fits just fine - this one does not even zip up. i might exchange for bigger size, as label is just a number to me and sizes are really inconsistent - or it may just go back."
1,"Great purchase. size down. Purchased this in-store today. i'm normally a small, but tried on x-small before trying on my regular size. the x-small fit perfectly. i'm 5""5, 135 lbs, with wide hips and petite derri茫篓re. the dress fit well, slightly hugging my bottom. while i don't like things that draw attention to my bottom, with an outward tug or two of the stretchy material of the dress, it fit perfectly. sweater dresses tend to be bulky, so it makes sense to down size. definitely a nice addition to my closet."
1,"Absolutely beautiful I almost never buy anything full price here and usually wait patiently for a sale + promotion :) however, this really struck me and i decided to buy it, telling myself it's an investment piece for years to come. it's just so unique and beautiful -- the things that makes retailer unique that aren't as common anymore.

____________
pros:
- very comfortable. i was skeptical because it's all polyester, but it's light and thin and breathable. it feels wonderful on the skin. the lining inside is ver"
1,"A great top with nice detail! The lace inlet sleeves on this comfy top add unexpected detail that dresses it up. you can wear this with jeans or skinny cords, as well as a fitted skirt. the material is comfy and the neck is not too tight, nor too loose.
i usually wear a small and the small fit the best. i tried the xs and medium and although they both fit, the xs seemed a bit too short and the medium was too long in the arms."
1,Wide and muted color This looked really pretty but i think i am just too short for it. a little on the wider side. would look good on someone taller
1,"Great for athletic bodies I have an athletic body 5'6"". i have no curves and this dress made me look so feminine and long and lean. on top of it being beautiful , the dress has a very comfortable ""jersey knit type"" lining. so easy to wear and incredibly comfortable sitting and /or dancing."
0,"More cropped than shown This sweater is much more cropped than shown. the sweater i received was only 24 inches long. the color of the trim is black, not the navy or plum that i expected. quality does seem good."
1,"Blue and white for the win! For the last two years, i have only purchased clothing for myself if it is secondhand, but then i saw this skirt and succumbed to temptation. first of all, the print is gorgeous! i'm a sucker for blue and white anything so it wasn't that hard of a sell. as other reviewers have mentioned, the seams line up! this kind of quality is so hard to find in clothing items anymore and really makes the skirt seem much more pricey than it really is (if you're buying it on sale like i did). i'm 5'3"" and will"
0, I can not imagine the cut in the waist being flattering on anyone. i ordered an xs and an xxs still would have flared too much in the waste. i ignored the previous review and that was a huge mistake!
1," Per reviews and from looking at retailer employee pics on instagram, i sized down to a small, cinched with a wide leather belt, topped with a cropped jacket, added some shooties and a necklace. when winter comes, this will go with my knee high suede boots, long wool coat and chunky scarf. this does not look like a table runner on me like the model shot and previous reviews imply. now i am tempted to buy the other color. i'm 5'3"" 135# 36d 38/28/35 and purchased red melange in size s."
1,"Great purchase I went back and forth on whether to purchase this dress, and i'm so glad i did. the fit was perfect. i'm always a little hesitant about long dresses since i'm 5'2"", but the petite length was perfect. the quality is great and the dress is so comfortable, but i feel elegant in it. i wore it for rehearsal dinner at my wedding and plan on wearing it again for a wedding next month."
1,"Delicate lace beautiful design This is a beautifully made sweater. i bought this sweater in ivory yesterday; i wore it today and received many compliments. i think the sweater is adorable. it?s soft and warm; the neck is perfect, i like that it?s not as restrictive as a turtleneck. the long sleeves add character and help to make it interesting. i highly recommend it?i?m looking for a black one,"
1,Exquisite skirt - yet runs 2 sizes small This skirt is of the highest quality. the fabric and cut is that of a much higher priced item. the fabric at the seams matches!!! no one mentions any longer when fabric seams are mismatched as if that is nonconsequential. to me it means the difference between good and great. this skirt is great except for the sizing. as other reviewers have mentioned....it runs so small. i wear a size 6 skirt. could not zip the 6. ordered the 8 - it zips yet puckers and while it could work - i'd be exhausted fro
1,"Gingham garden dress renamed and new color I purchased this dress for the second time: it is the gingham garden dress from 2015 that was blue and white. same dress, new name and color. generally, this dress is large overall and long. i wish i could have purchased the petite size. i liked it enough to have it in black and white. this time around i ordered one size down and fit is much better.
recommendation: order 1 size down from your normal sizing as dress runs large.
the quality of the knit material is soft and flowing."
0," I bought the red motiff in my usual size of xxs petite and it was huge. at first i thought they had mistakenly sent the wrong size but this was sadly not the case. the fit is definitely ""sack-like"" as other reviewers mentioned. i had to return."
1,"Gorgeous This is a dress for a princess. i admire this dress so much, online and in person. i tried on this dress a few times every time i visited the store. the beads throughout the dress provide a low-key surprise sparkle, especially in the sun. the colors are much more vibrant in person, which is breathtaking against the light cream background. the fabric is soft and flowy. unfortunately for me, it doesn't fit right. size 6 fits well but the arm holes are too big and the midi part makes me look frumpy"
1,"Comfortable knit dress I'm a 12/14 and i got a large and the dress fits nicely through the hips/seat. i'm kind of pear shaped so it's a bit large through the top, but i intend to layer another knit top under it so that's ok. 
 i didn't want the knit dress to be too tight or else it would stretch out after sitting. i like the colors and the fabric. the weave is loose and after snagging it on my glasses taking it off i'm careful with it. it will be nice into fall with a sweater."
1,"Lovely with details My daughter got this dress in the 10 and i got it in the 6 - we are both tall. also, she's a redhead and got the butterfly version and i'm blonde and got the pink. also, both of us are small-chested - and since there is no give in the fabric, i don't know where one would fit boobs if you have them. one thing i noted (and i am not happy about) is that the back is puckered up along the zipper. this has to be on purpose, and i don't really understand that detail, as it doesn't flatter me and it loo"
1,"Just gorgeous I am a fan of these designers and their gorgeous fabrics - most of which are heavy brocades. this is so pretty and fun. the print is playful, and colors are gorgeous, and the fit is floaty but not too full or too tight. i love the bit of beading, and that i can dress it up or down.

i am petite and not usually a bigger print or long dress fan, but i know that i will wear this one for years. 

i did get a 00 petite as i know that only this small size fits me at retailer - 0's swallow me. this i"
0,"Misrepresented in picture Dress appears to be slim fit, but that's far from the case. usually wear an xs regular because i have a long torso for my 5'3"", but it just hung on me like a heavy sack. i have a hard time finding dresses now that i'm not working and like to have a couple on hand for all purpose occasions--weddings, memorials, special occasions. i hoped this one would meet my needs. disappointed."
1,"Beautiful dress I ordered this in a 2, but returned for a 4 because the arm holes were a little tight. other than that, this is a absolutely flattering dress. u will be wearing it for an outdoor garden wedding shower. the beading around the flowers makes such a different accent. just be careful zipping it up. love it!"
1,"The very good and the very bad First of all, the fabric's summery pattern of blossoms, honeybees and butterflies is beautiful and absolutely unique. i love it so much i wish i could afford to keep the dress as an art object. also, with one important exception, the dress is well made. the underslip is the right length and opacity. the dress is not transparent,
which is a big plus. there is a slight greenish cast to the background instead of the pure ivory shown
in the pictures. this makes the color a bit harder to wear. and"
1,"Very classy and subtly chic This a a great sweater! it is classic, but has the fun surprise element of the lace bell sleeves. loved it so much i got the black and the sea mist. looks great with jeans or leggings! the only negative is you can call it that is that the sleeves are a tad long for me. compliments everytime i wear!"
1,Very pretty Very pretty sweater! i love the bell sleeves with the design on the sides. the sweater runs a bit short though and wish it hung a little longer. looks great with flare jeans and boots!
1," This is a beautiful knit dress, however it runs large, so be wary. for reference i am a 34d, 28 inch waist, and 41 inch hips. i ordered a medium because dresses usually run tight around my bum, and it was very, very big. i'm hoping the small is much more flattering because the quality of the knit is very nice."
1,"Simply elegant! I love the way this dress fits and flows! it does run big. i normally wear size 6 in retailer dresses. had to downsize to 6p. for reference, i'm 5'10"" and 34c. the pink color is 1 shade darker than shown in the pictures.there was a tear in fabric along the zipper. called for replacing the dress. the sales rep was very pleasant & agreed to send another one!"
0,"Big, boxy sweater I ordered this sweater in xxsp and the sweater is still very large on me. it is definitely a sweater that is supposed to hang off of your shoulders, however, i'm finding that it wants to fall all the way off of me. the quality is nice. it is medium in weight. it has a cottony feeling, but it not super soft. it looks way better on the model shown than in person to me. i wanted to love it, but i only just like it. i think others will like this if you are looking for a fun, loose look in a sweater."
0,"Beautiful knit dress - runs way large! I ordered an xxs petite and this hangs like a bag on me. i'm usually fine with the petite sizing, but this didn't work and i'm so bummed. the dress is soft, the blue color is gorgeous, but it fits like a bag. i wanted to love this, but sadly will have to return. i think someone with curves will love this dress. it is really beautiful quality, just does not fit a petite frame."
1,"Stunning dress I debated buying this, so glad i did. tts. i'm 5'5"" 115 and 32c. i got size 2, and it worked but i could have done a 0 (which is my usual size). i was afraid to order it too small because i needed it right away! this dress is gorgeous! i got the pink color way and it is more vibrant in person. the beading is beautiful, it's incredibly soft and flowy! this dress is probably my favorite dress ever! if you're on the fence, order it!"
1,"Love this dress! I got this in blue and i love it! it skims your curves without being clingy, and it is very comfortable. i was hesitant to buy this, but it's surprisingly flattering! it will be perfect with heels for early fall, then worn with a long sleeve shirt and boots when the temperatures dip. my only caution is that it is shorter than it appears in this photo. it falls well above my knees, and i am shorter than the model. regardless, i am thrilled with my purchase!"
0,"Very disappointed I loved these pants and purchased them in three colors. like another reviewer, within a few weeks, having worn them no more than a couple of times, the fabric in the crotch area started to wear thin and two pairs developed holes. i was not hard on the pants - just wore them to the office - and line dried them. so disappointing, as i really did love the pants. total waste of money."
1,"Beautiful and unique sweater I had purchased the black color of this sweater at full price and loved it so much that when i saw the burgundy color go on sale i knew i had to have it! this sweater is very comfortable and elevates any look with its lace down the sleeve, mock neck collar, and slightly flared silhouette. it's so fun to find different shirts to wear underneath to get a whole new look. highly recommend, would have gotten all colors!"
1,Love it Love this sweater. it fits true to size. fun and different. purchased 30% off but i don't think the price it terrible depending on your clothing budget.
0,"Disappointed I had high hopes ordering this top...unfortunately the top has a metallic fiber to the material and that detail was not noted in the product description! it also felt rather cheap & scratchy, poor quality for the price."
0,"Buttons at top break too easily Let me start off by saying that i really, really wanted this jumpsuit to work as it looked good on me and was tts (got a 6p). unfortunately, it didn't work out due to the two buttons at the top which break way too easily. i had to return it and exchange for another jumpsuit but it did me no good as the second one did the very same thing so i didn't even bother trying it on. the buttons broke through before i even got the chance as the material is far too thin and the back of the buttons just pop"
1,"Decent hold, cute I love the 2 straps details, funny thing though is thsi bra is giving me rounder boobs... a little cleavage, nto waht i am sued to with a sports bra. lvoe the color (ordered the purple)."
1,"Sian mini skirt So there weren't any product reviews to go by when i ordered the last small. i had no way of knowing if it ran big, small, or tts. i'm usually a med, but to my surprise the small worked due to the fluid pleating. it sits right on my natural waistline similar to the model and not too short in length (i'm 5'8""). i also like the med weight of the fabric it moves freely when you walk, but not too light. it is similar to a double weight georgette or crepe."
0,"Not the same dress After reading the other reviews i still took a chance on ordering this dress becasue it looks so cute on the model. the dress they sent me is not this dress. it is the same material although the one i received had only one stripe down the canter, like a cross. there was no v back as stated by the other reviewer. it was scoop and if you pulled it down, the neck went up. the dress i received is branded as holding horses while the brand listed on here, is rava. the length measured at 39"" not the st"
1,"Great basic skirt Great basic skirt to have.  it flows beautifully and the print is a classic with a twist.  it can be dressed up or down, with heels or flats.  a great addition to my wardrobe!"
1,"Fun and a little bit sexy I love this piece! like another reviewer i did notice a broken button right out of the package but it was so great in every other way that i'm going to keep it and have that mended and the buttons reinforced.

i'm 5' 7, 140, generally a size 8/medium, small frame on top but baby growing hips ;) -- i found it tts"
1," When i saw this dress in the store in a size small (i usually wear a large), i thought, ""how cute!"" so i tried it on. it fit very well...all but in the armhole. so i decided to order a medium. i received the medium and it fits exactly like the small, armhole and all. in addition, i agree with other reviews that this dress' description ""above the knee"" does not accurately describe length unless you're somewhat tall. i found this dress hit me just where i'd like it to...right above the knee. not a"
0,"Failure I really wanted to like this jump suit.  i rarely have problem with retailer clothing.  i'm 5.6, hourglass shape, usually wear size 2.  this jumpsuit runs small, but that's not the only problem.  top part (shirt piece of the jumpsuit) is too short, so it's digging into my lady part.  the color does not look anything like the picture, so overall this piece is failure.  i hope that i find something similar but fits better."
1,"Love this top I love the lace on this top, it's perfect. it's great for my shape, i'm
so happy with this purchase."
1,"Everyday skirt, but just okay The reason for the title above is this skirt doesn't wow me. i felt like i could find this anywhere, and i don't go to retailer for such things. they have definitely mainstreamed more and more over the years....
__________
pros:
- tts. i tried on a large (and i'm normally either a 10 or 12) and it fit well and hung well on my hourglass and wider hips without billowing out.
- flows nicely! it does have a great movement to it.
- a good everyday skirt.
- not sheer at all. it is lined.

0," I've been buying from retailer for the last 15 years and this is the first time i've ever posted a bad review. first of all the fabric is scratchy, thin, and looks very cheap. second of all there is no v back, it's more of a slight scoop. and lastly i'm 5'3"" so i ordered the petite small and it's still comes 4 inches below my knee. i am very disappointed in the quality and am definitely sending back. the only thing i think this could possible good for is a swim coverup."
0,"Quality and style strange I liked this top, i really did. i also liked the subtle shimmer. the fabric didn't seem as soft, but i could not get over the big difference in length between the front and the back. you can see it on the model here, but when i tried it on it was even more obvious and just didn't look right. asymmetrical tops look better when the length difference is not so large, but here it is. the print at the top also made my shoulders look a little broader. i am sending it back."
1,"Take car with it, but it's gorgeous I love this dress. i agree with the other reviewers that the rhinestone linkages do very easily get caught on the lace part of the dress and i could see it snagging very quickly. that said, i am going to keep it and hope for the best because it is absolutely gorgeous. it is not actually a true white as it looks pictured. instead we, it is more of a nude color, but it adds to the flattering nature of the dress and makes it look sheer. the embroidery is beautiful. my only complaint is that it will"
1,"Surprise! I love clothing that has little surprises, and i love the detailing at the arms with the lace-like openings which is not very characteristic (and actually quite fancy) for a typical henley. i found the fabric to be medium weight-and thought the quality was fine. i like all of the colors this comes in-each would fit into my wardrobe nicely. i have gotten into comfortable clothing (that is still flattering and functional) lately and am on a huge kick of gravitating toward it. this top certainly is"
1, This is a beautiful dress and fits well. the embroidery is delicate and can snag easily.
0,"Flimsy Oh what a disappointment! i was looking forward to wearing this as a layering piece with the shawl cardigan. the material lacks serious quality and it was ripped on the seam. so, back it goes. and, i am flabbergasted at the price retailer is charging almost $60 for this top!"
1,"Great lightweight henley Got this in the petite xs in mint; the color is gorgeous, it's a really bright mint that complements my super fair skin really well (though it would work for pretty much any skin tone). it's still a good length in the petite for the type of shirt it is (5'1 and hits right around my lower hips). it is a thinner fabric, but that's what i was expecting, and the lace detailing at the bottom of the sleeves is a nice touch and makes it more than just a plain henley."
1,"Charcoal, pale gray, a bit of silver! These socks are soft and comfortable, and they are very short so they'll be good with booties. i couldn't tell from the pictures but the pale gray dots are surrounded by a border of subtle silver thread. they're adorable!"
1,"Flattering and unique Beautiful, unique design. it's very flattering the way the fabric hangs.

i usually wear a 10, but because the lining is much smaller than the dress (which many linings are... it's a pet peeve of mine), i sized up to a 12 and took in the shoulders a couple inches so the bodice area would sit correctly on my bust. otherwise in the 10 my stomach would feel squeezed even if it looked like it fit perfectly. that said, i'm very sensitive to that kind of thing.

other reviewers have noted that the emb"
1," I had my eye on this for a while and finally picked it up on sale. i got the darker blue in xs. great piece, fits well. very cozy but the cuffs add such cute detail."
1,"Cute jumpsuit I love a jumpsuit for its ease of dressing. this is the 3rd i've purchased from retailer.
material is thin and gauzy as described. with a sweater or jacket it will be plenty warm for so cal winters and great the rest of the year.
if you are all tall, the waist might fall a bit short. i am 5'6"" and the waist just barely hits my waistline.
doubt i would have purchased this item full price, but on sale it's a great deal."
1,"Beautiful twist on a classic I found this top to be very beautiful and well made.
the fabric is on the lighter side, however for me that is a double plus.
it is great for layering with a cami underneath and/or a heavier sweater on top.
and going towards spring it extends wearing time.
the lace on the sleeves is beautiful and a pretty peek a boo effect if layered under another sweater.
it 's a subtle sexy top with endless possibilities.
i found it runs very true to size.
i purchased the aqua and after receiving it i rushed t"
1,New favorite jeans These are nice jeans for the price. they are tight at first but do stretch out so i am glad i went with my normal denim size and didn't size up. i wish they didn't have a button fly but it didn't bother me enough to return them.
1,"Great jeans I love these jeans but be advised that they run a little small in the waist. they work for me but i think they'd work best on those with an hourglass shape. i'm 5'7"" and about 112 lbs with a small waist and i wear a 28 in these. but i have hips - the 28 fits perfectly since it has a small waist but accommodates my hips. i love these jeans. great fit, good fabric, great price!"
1,"Breathtaking! This is the most beautiful dress i've ever owned. the detail is exquisite. i never write reviews and felt i had to for this dress. i love it!

the embroidery does catch on the beading so you have to handle it carefully. it's worth the special treatment, though!"
1,"So much cuter than picture!! I was checking out at my local retailer when one of the salespeople held up this top and said someone had just returned it.  they were talking about how cute it was (they didn't have it in the store).  i asked what size it was and it was a medium, so i said i want to try it on.  after trying it on, i fell in love, it is so cute, the cut fit great.  it is a little big but the small might have been too snug in the bust.  if you are in between sizes, you can probably size down.  i wore it yest"
1,"Cute itsy socks Love polkadots, love sparkle. these little socks are perfect for booties."
1,Sweet top I love this top. i had no issues with fabric. it is soft and light. the wrist details are very pretty. i love the buttons. it fits true to size and it is a good layering top. i got the red which is true to the picture. not looking red but a bright coral color.
1," Ok because i'm petite i thought there's no way this was going to work, but it does! a little sheer would probably wear with a boyfriend cardi to work, dark undergarments a must. but flattering and comfortable."
1,"Nice, but colors not quite as pictured These are nice, flattering short. however the colors and patters are not quite as pictured. i almost suspect they are slightly different on each short. exmaple: on the picture online the left leg seems to be mint green and the right one blue. the ones i received the left leg is a darker, bluishgreen color. the right leg is orange. i would hae prefered the colors on the photo but it is not a big deal i guess. i ordered the color block bra as well and it has the same issue: colors and patterns are"
1,"Gorgeous coat This coat is simply beautiful. i love the slits on the sides, it makes it unique and sexy. i would suggest that you go up a size so the silhouette is not disturbed by any pulling or tugging. i'm so happy with my purchase!"
1,Super socks I love these little socks ? and the dots sparkle. i wear them with my heels and leggings or jump suit pants when i don't want a higher sock or knee-high stockings.
1,"Versatile go-to jeans I liked the simple styling of these jeans when i saw them in the store. the price is right considering what some jeans cost today. unfortunately, these are made in china. that bummed me out. they run a tad bit small but in the end i think they are more true to size because they give especially in the waist. the higher waist is a nice change. it's nice to be able to skip a belt. the denim is a bit rough after air drying so i hope it softens up."
1,"Levis wedgie Love these jeans! so comfortable and the high waist is great for my long torso. these are real denim, not the thin stretchy legging type jeans. they fit true to size on me-  i am 5'4"" 120 pounds and i wear a 26. they were a little long so i chopped them off to hit just above the ankle"
1," I agree with the other reviews that the side slits are not at all represented in the images. thankfully there was an instagram photo of the coat posted by the time i ordered it that showed the side panels very clearly, so i was not caught off guard. i like that the panels allow for ease of movement, but when there's a cold wind it would be nice if they were not there. this coat is a great statement piece for a night out, just not as much for day to day wear if you're looking for something warm a"
1,"Pretty but not for me :( I ordered this dress in pm and it was very tight in the top. also, the dress is lovely but the undertones are very gray colored and did not go well with my skin/coloring. it had to go back but others may love it (i have dark hair/olive skin). it also ran a small on top (i'm 38 d). there should be a pm available soon lol"
0,Large fit I was really excited to get this dress and to my dismay when i pulled it out of the package i could tell i would be disappointed. i tried it on and i was correct....it looked like i was wearing a huge tent. i returned it.
1," I've been looking for a light colored flowy cardigan for awhile and finally found this one is perfect. the materials is soft and has just the right about of details for me with the gently ruffled edges, tie front an some bunching around the sleeves. color is between ivory and tan. i am petite height and medium framed with broad shoulders and since they didn't have petite in stock, i bought regular s. it fits well enough, though i probably could have bought an xs. my new favorite card!"
1,"Better in person I think it's prettier in person. the color is a little brighter in reality, and the beading on the lower half is in 2 colors (green and gray), which isn't apparent in the photo. although i would consider it true to size, it's a full looking top. i'm 5'8', and both the sleeves and the length are not as long on me as they are on the model. it's a bit sheer, but i personally found it to be fine with a nude bra. cute vintage look."
0,"Disappointing This skirt is definitely not what i was expecting. the material is stiff and rough. the skirt is also loud. you can hear it swishing when you move, and not in a classy way. it feels like you're wearing a very long tutu. also, the pattern isn't quite as pretty in person. they must have used magic in order to make this skirt look flowy in the photos - it does not flow."
0,"Way too much fabric I wanted to love this jumpsuit. it looks adorable in the product photo. i am 5'5"" about 120lbs and thus was overwhelming on me. i tried everything--- pulling up the tie at the waist to create a higher line, wearing a variety of heel heights----i couldn't seem to make it work. there was just so much fabric on me! it felt like i was wearing pajamas (and not in a cute 'wear your pajamas out' way). i love the idea and the photo appears to have an adorable line and cut. on me, this jumpsuit was just"
1,"Even nicer in person Had a feeling when i saw this that it would be a great top. love the way the elasticized neck hugs tightly and has two little back buttons. the beading is elegant and subtle. the body flows nicely, not overly billowy. definitely true to size. interesting ocher color; a yellowy-green. this is one to own."
1,Love the olive color It's a soft comfy fabric... cute ruffle... may be a little on the bigger side but still super cute! very form fitting but still fits true to size imo the olive color is even more beautiful in person!
1,"Easy basic I love pilcro legging jeans (and cords!) and this pair was no exception. i didn't see much difference in the fit, and i bought my usual 27. the stretch definitely creates a lot of give, but i don't mind. i'd be hesitant to size down in the waistband, but if you usually have room and prefer a more snug fit then go ahead. washed well the first time."
1,"Love this color and style, just not for me! This dress is beautiful, it just swallowed my small frame whole! the colors and design are gorgeous, just not a good fit for me, even at a 0p."
1,"Might want to size down I just got this in the mail today. it's really cute when i put it on, but it's definitely meant to be worn slightly off the shoulders like the model is showing. i was hoping i could wear it both ways, but then the v-neck becomes way too low. i would recommend sizing down unless you're bigger busted. however, the torso is cut very true to size which might make it hard for some to size down without it becoming too small. a larger bust might help to keep this from falling off the shoulders. i'm not"

0, I was expecting a nice golden yellow color but what i received was very dull in color with greenish undertones. very disappointed. will be returning.

1,"So versatile! I absolutely love this cardigan! it is so soft and goes with anything. it can be dressed up or down. it is definitely my new ""go to"" for airplane travels. highly recommend!!"
0,"Nice fabric, poor design This dress has a beautiful fabric, i really hated to send it back. it was just so unflattering, absolutely no shape to it. i bought a 0p, i'm 5'5"" and 117lbs and it looked like a maternity dress on me."
0,"If curvy...stay away! I had such high hopes for this shirt! i got it in both the black and moss (which is a beautiful color). however, the ruffle was just too big. i put it on and immediately felt like a circus clown. it would probably be beautiful on a woman with a more straight figure with fewer curves, but on me, it was not flattering at all."
1,"Loved these! I saw online and bought in white and moss! moss is darker in person. i am 106, 5'1 but a 30f and the top fits very well. it actually minimized my chest which i love! not sure how well this would fit on small-chested ladies. not super clingy in the midsection but will look nice with pants or skirts. super happy!"

1,Beautiful but too bulky in the middle This is a beautiful dress. i ordered a size 10 to accommodate my bust (36d) which it did but the rest of the dress was too big. it was bulky in the middle area and did nothing for my shape. this would likely work best for smaller ladies.
1,"The perfect skirt for all year, every year. To start: i'm 135 lbs, 5'7"", 34c, 28 jeans, size 4 dress -- amazing skirt for an outstanding price! incredibly lightweight; has a stretchy-jersey lining. to fit high-waisted like the model, go down 1-2 sizes. in work slacks, i wear a size 6 or 8. however, my natural waist is small. i tried on the size 2 and the size 4. i purchased the size 2, although i still wish there was a size 0 to try on. a larger size will fit lower at the waist and will bring the midi length to ankle length."
1,"Fits differently than other washes This wash fits differently than other pilcro jean leggings. the rise is higher and the fit is larger/bulkier through the waist and hips. i love pilcro legging jeans, so the fit difference is kind of disappointing. i recommend trying this wash on first to see if you need a smaller size. i got the same size i always get in this style and this wash is definitely not as flattering as other pairs i own."
1,"Beautiful fabric, runs big Bought this dress on sale - i haven't decided if i'm going to keep it yet or not, because i'm not sure if it's flattering to my bubble butt. i normally wear a 6-8 in retailer (5'6"" 135 lbs thin limbs 38-26-38). i ordered this dress in a size 4 regular and i find the length perfect with flats or with heels. i also find the bust area, waist and hips accommodating without being tight, which usually never happens. for this current sale price, this is a gorgeous dress made with beautiful material."
1,Beautiful color I tried this on when i saw it hanging in the dressing room. i was pleasantly surprised by this piece. the color is beautiful - not too yellow - not too brown. i have not worn it yet so i'm assuming it will hold up pretty well considering my other pieces from this designer are still looking good with several wears. i bought this in a small size so it does not hang down like it does on the model. perhaps that's why i don't need a cami underneath.
1,"Unique I'm always looking for something that is unique and can be layered. this looks just like it does on the model. you'll need a cami underneath as it is not lined. a little shorter in front than in the back but drapes nicely. styled it with black denim ankle jeans, black loafers (or boots), and a blue denim jacket. i'm 118#, 34d, 5'4"" and the s fit well."
1,A little short Overall very pretty.
1,"Great item for a future bride I love this robe and can't wait to wear it while i'm getting ready for my upcoming wedding. the only con that i can see is that the sleeves are a bit baggy, but other than that it's perfect!"
1,Love the pattern I bought this as a present and am very happy with it! the pattern is fun and i like the slouchy fit.
0,"Pass if you're busty The print and style we're great! unfortunately, my bust unbuttons the top. there's no way i can wear this, even if i sized up."
1,Cute! Love this sweater. i wore it to work with leggings and a long sleeved shirt underneath. it lays nicely.
1,"Perfect dressy jogger! These joggers are so comfortable. nice and lightweight and fabric is very soft and a bit stretchy, so they move with you. beautiful dark navy/indigo print, very subtle and blends well with many tops. perfect length (i am 5'3"", 116 lb. and purchased xs). love them!"
1,Love it This skirt is a perfect statement piece that will work fancy cocktails and social events. it is a full skirt but not too overwhelming. perfect with a slim fitting black bodysuit. i sized up a bit and ordered an 8. waist fits well and length works with slight heel. quality is great. design is beautiful without being too much.
1,"Goddess dress This dress is so beautiful it makes me feel like a goddess, lol. i'm normally a 10/12 or m/l and took a 12. i think the 10 would have worked too. everything from the colors, fit and flow of the dress is wonderful. i didn't have any problem with there being too much fabric as some of the reviews mentioned."
1,"This skirt is amazing Love, love, love this skirt. perfect for the holidays but it can also be dressed down. pair it with gold, burgundy, black or a more casual chambray jean shirt. a great price point and i was able to grab it when it was 20% off."
1,"Eclat midi skirt If you can get over the fact that this skirt feels (and looks awfully similar to) the exact same fabric your drugstore halloween costumes had when you were a little kid... then, it's surprisingly fun to wear."
1,Amazing! I can't say enough about this jumpsuit. within 1 hour of wearing this shopping i had 4 compliments from strangers.   it is flattering. pretty. soft. comfortable. love love love
1,Cute and professional look Purchased this top in navy blue. it is versatile. appropriate for the office and to go out. i specifically like the look with white jeans. it looks put together. the quality is good and there are several nice detsils in the design. highly recomnend it.
1,"Flirty and dazzling happy This skirt is unique yet versatile and gorgeous. everything about this skirt works: dazzle balanced out with softness and midi length. the twirly width shows off the skirt in a subtle way, and super comfortable. no petite 2 left so i purchased a regular 2 and it fits perfectly (i am 5ft2in, 26 waist, 36 hips), the hem falls about 2in. longer than shown on the model. this skirt is sold out fast, no surprise. it flatters all body types at all ages. get ready for lots of compliments!"
1,Flattering and comfy! This top is my favorite of the season! planning to order in black too.
1,"Favorite sweater ever This sweater is the bomb. it's soft, flattering, and looks good with everything. i ordered a second one to have when this one gets worn out!"
1," Tried on & bought in-store. so cute & flattering; the picture doesn't do it justice. great neutral piece (more beige than ivory in person). looks cute tied or untied. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs and the regular size s fit perfectly (not too snug, not too loose, and just long enough to cover my bum.)"
1,"Rip favorite pair Lots of pairs of the pilcro serif-- and for some reason, after 5mo or less of normal wear, these have bit the dust. 
i don't dry my denim and do wash on gentle cycles... this pair just doesn't seem to be too happy. began pilling after two washes, just seems to be a different blend of fabric than the others? 

super bummed and now there's no way to replace it. wamp wamp."
1,"Great for layering I love this sweater. it's sort of like a tunic and sort of like a vest. i am pairing it with leggings and a white long sleeve tee underneath. i'm 5'3"" 109 lbs and the xs fit very well. i love the versatility and design of this."
1,Excellent fit and style These leggings run true to size. the strappy detail at the ankle is a nice touch. i especially like the quality of the material used as they are not see-through like some leggings tend to be.
1, Very cute top but it is wide and runs large. it is very flattering with skinny jeans and the color is a beautiful navy almost a hint of purple. i would consider a size down. may run on the short side for those with longer torsos.
1,"Great quality - runs narrow I love this top! it's well-made (important if you're in chlorine or salt water) and has vibrant colors. the back strap has two clasp options, so not much room for adjustment but i like this fastening method because you don't have a big bow to lay on when laying out."
1,Great topper piece This sweater/jacket is great over any blouses. love the color. it looks more slightly peachy cream color that i love! goes with everything. warm. i thought it ran true to size. i ordered a small and love the way it fits. if you are looking for more of an oversized piece then you would need to size up.
1,"Cute! I don't normally like ""lace-up"" details, but for some reason, i don't mind it on this top. it's a bit shorter than it looks on the model (and i'm not especially tall). the fabric is nice - not too heavy, not too lightweight. great for fall."
1,The product looks great on Love this top. fits me perfect. i am bigger on top and received many compliments in this shirt.
1," I went to the store to try on a jumpsuit and ended up with these instead. while the jumpsuit was really cute, i thought these would be more versatile. as far as i can tell they are the same style as the pradollano tapered loungers by hei hei. these were so cute and comfy i bought both. they can easily be dressed up with a jacket and heels or worn casually with a tee and sandals. i think these are much cuter in person than online. there is a little red design in the pants which is hard to see in"
1,"Cute, poorly made Love the fit of this top, love the design. it does fit a bit small which was a pleasant surprise considering the sizes don't go as small as i usually have to. i got the smallest size and its pretty tight. its a revealing/low cut top, which is great for minimal tan lines. negative- threads are coming out all over after one wear. but i love it so much i will probably order again once it falls apart.. not so great considering the price though."
1,"Beautiful sweater My new favorite. i purchased the ivory in a medium, and the lilac in a large when it went on sale (medium was already sold out). i'm 5'7"" and about 125 pounds, 34c give or take. the medium fits great, and i found the large only slightly bigger, but it does not look too big. i usually wear a small or medium in most retailer sweaters.
as was previously noted, the back is cut higher than pictured. i actually like this, as it gives the sweater a unique look. i tend to layer with a button down for the"
1,"Love! So comfortable, fit just right, flattering, beautiful neutral color, but different, love the embroidery, nothing bad about it. that being said, i haven't worn them the whole day, i suspect they will stretch a bit. also have not washed them, so i hope the color stays the nice rich dark gray turquoise, the length is perfect too, i ordered the petite and they fit as on the model (for a change, i have pretty short legs). (115 lbs, 26.5 in waist, muscular legs)"
1,"Love love love Super cute, well made, great embroidery. waist runs big."
1,"Pretty top This top runs large. i am usually a medium in retailer but when i read the first review, i ordered a small, and it was the right decision. i also agree that this top might be short for someone with long torso. love the back detail and the print and color is really nice!"
0,"Overpriced and see-through This style is right up my alley and i was excited to receive it. however, it is seriously overpriced. i ordered the white and the material is thin and see-through. the small was even a bit roomy (5'7"", 140lbs, 32dd). going back unfortunately."
0,"Not what i expected This top looked so cute in the picture, but unfortunately doesn't live up to it! the one i received, actually has the print shown in the photo on the inside of the shirt. it makes it much darker, and boring. the shirt itself is on the short side, and would've looked better if it hit lower on the hips, there's just too much fabric for it to land higher than that."
1,"Grecian style Love this dress! the light fabric quality, color, and design all added to the grecian goddess feeling! my usual 0 fit perfectly, giving me a great shape and the length is great!"
1," This dress has rich color, excellent quality fabric and wonderful style. you can wear it now for fall with boots and jean jacket or in the summer for a great sun dress."
1,"Nice and flowy Definitely order down a size. i am almost always an xl (big chest, broad shoulders) but the l in this fits me perfectly. well worth the sale price, a fun boho transition piece!
it is a ""reverse print"" so the inside is brighter than the outside, but i like the blurred paisley print--it's subtle.

the back detail is great and very flattering.

it is quite full and flowy, but in a flattering way, i think. just restrained enough."
1,"Great features on this boho too Love the muted pattern in the blue and spots of gray, front and back. i wore this with my gray legging/pants. the pleats allow for a relaxed fit; very comfortable over all."
0,Only good for small busted ladies Cup size is really small for a medium. no way to adjust the back strap. ended up giving it to my daughter. cute but so poorly executed.
1,"Stylish, but run a little large I'd say these are exactly as-pictured and i'm happy with them. they run a little big in the waist; i most often wear xspetite in retailer sizes, and can often wear xs regular but these are a bit loose (i have a 26"" waist, 34"" hips). the drawstring tie solves that of course but it's only in the front, it doesn't go all the way around the waist, the rest is elastic. i'd also say these are high-rise, or long in the crotch (but i'm only 5'3"" so they're probably mid-rise on tall people). i have them hi"
1,Perfect fit Love this top!! fits perfectly & it's lovely
1,"Flowy and comfy This top is very flattering on my torso (my ""problem area""). the sleeves are adorable and i love the navy with purple tints and the touches of gray. i would say this product could work on most body types. it's very comfortable and i could wear it for a long time. i would suggest considering a smaller size than one's normal size, but i would look into both sizes and see which one you prefer. i ended up getting my regular size because i just liked the way it looked better."
1,"Pretty, ordered in wrong size I ordered this online in the cream color and because some of the reviews mentioned the shorter back, i went with a medium, but that ended up running too big. i typically wear between a 4 and a 6 / small and medium so i'm always on the fence about which size to get. i often order both online and return the one that doesn't fit as well, so i wish i had this time too! the detail on the front is super cute and i didn't even mind the plainer back, but the sleeves went well past my wrist and i felt li"
1,"Very pretty, didn't like the pattern I wanted to like this top so badly because it has so many interesting pieces to the blouse. ultimately i didn't keep this because of the bell sleeves, and the pattern going across the body just wasn't flattering on my full figure. i went down a size to help reduce the amount of fabric draping in the back, but it didn't make up for the pattern that i just didn't like. if you are interested in this blouse, i recommend it because it might work out for someone with a different figure than mine"
1,"Beautiful joggers These joggers are super cute and comfortable in addition to being stylish.  they have beautiful colors and design. if these were presented in other colors, i would buy those as well. 5,5 135. small fit perfectly."
1,"Perfect summer pants Recently bought these on sale, though they were still a bit in the expensive side. i'm 5'2"" and typically a size 4, the xs fits perfectly. the pants fall to my ankle and are not cropped as they are on the model, but i'm fine with that. the piping on the seams helps them not seem too much like pajamas, and i was particularly pleased that the crotch was not too baggy, as sometimes happens with this style."
0,"Great sweater, not crazy about the collar I didn't really notice the collar when i ordered it on line and i'm not really liking it. it's the rough, unstitched thing they like to do sometimes and it just makes it look slightly more casual and well, rough around the edges. it's a nicely cut, great fitting sweater though so i'll be looking for some scarves!"
1,"A lil skimpy I love the design of this and the pattern! it's comfy but a bit too much side boob for actually swimming. i like a bit more coverage, the front has great coverage but on the side... whoa!!!"
0,Small cup sizes for frame The top of this suit was not proportioned well. i am normally a 34c so with swimsuits i vary between a small or a medium. the cup size on this was very small for a medium. the band to hook in the back was almost too big. there was no way to adjust the band in the back and the cups were clearly too small for a c cup. the print was darling but unfortunately this will have to go back.
1,"Great leggings, but may not be for petites. I purchased these leggings to match the top pictured with the outfit. i love the top, and i wanted to love the leggings since the combination of the top with the leggings has fantastic style. alas, the straps around the ankle got bunched because my legs are just not long enough. even though these are very comfortable leggings, i will be returning the leggings due to the length issue."
1,Not boring A little treat for me. i work from home and am sick of all my boring tops. this is a comfy little updo number.
1,"Love the embroidery! These wanderer pants are my go to. i love the patch pocket styling. they are true to size, but seem to stretch, so buy a size down. trust me, it will work."
0,"This was quite short As much as i loved the fabric and lace on this top, the cut of this blouse was not flattering for my body shape. also i thought it was shorter than it looked online. i had to return this piece."
1,"Long sleeves I ordered this sweater in green in petite large. the color and knit is beautiful and the shoulders and body fit comfortably; however, the sleeves were very long for a petite. i roll them, and it looks okay but would have rather had a normal petite length sleeve."
1,"Versitile! I was not sure if they would be flattering with the waistband, but i love them. they feel wonderful, yet they are so light. perfect for warm weather. the print takes them from day to night."
0,Not ivory This sweater i bought to go with a navy dress. it is not ivory. it is sortof a blush color???? not at all what i had in mind. the sweater itself is pretty. the back is shorter as someone else described which looks slightly awkward when wearing it. definite return. :(
1,"Large loose thin flutter tee This tee is cute and unusual and i am sure i will wear it pretty often. i do wish i had ordered a size smaller than my normal large, but i am waiting for it to shrink in the wash a bit. the material is thin and it certainly doesn't feel like it is worth the price tag. i got it on sale and still think it is only worth about 20$."
0,"Made me look top heavy This didn't work for me. it looks better unzipped. the piece made me look extremely top heavy, and i am by no means overweight, but i do have a larger chest on a small frame (36c, 5 feet, 115). honestly, it just made me look fat. the design is cute, but this is going back.."
1,"Different, cute I'm 5'8, 130 and a small fits nice. these are different with the silky fabric, pattern and piping - busy but still classy. it is hard to match with a shirt as you need a shorter top so you don't lose too much of the pant's unique design."
0,"So sad I love the colors. however, $200 is a lot to pay for a small piece of fabric , no lining what so ever. the fabric is very thin. you will need a slip. looks just like a cover-up. going back."
1,"Beautiful detail I was a bit nervous ordering this dress because it had so much going on, but i have to say, it's beautiful on! it's stretchy and super comfortable as well. i usually struggle with tight pencil like dresses, but this is stretchy and super comfy! no riding up on me! i cannot say enough good things about this dress, it's just so flattering and i get so many compliments when i wear it."
0,"Meh Skirt was too big in the wiast and too much fabric. was not flattering, and generally not cute enough to warrent spending 50$ to get it tailored. usual size, oop felt atleast 2 sizes too large. the pattern on the skirt, and the nuetral color is very nice. if you can find one that fits, would be a nice 3 season skirt!"
1,"Stretch in all the right places This dress is more beautiful in person.
this dress fits well on top for my broad shoulders, chest(40c)and through my straight hips. note. the side bottom panels are very stretchy. i will have it tailored slimmer. so if you are bottom curvy, this dress is awesome!"
1,"Runs small!! I was in trouble when i saw this dress in the new arrivals section this month! it's one of those dresses i had to have for the holidays. i didn't want to risk it not fitting so i ordered my usual size 6 and also a size up, 8. (5'6"", 135lbs, size 6) well the 6 was entirely to tight, i couldn't even zip past my rib cage. the 8 went on, but it was very body con looking! hugged every curve! this might be the look some might be going for, but not me!! i'm so disappointed that i can't have the dress f"
1,"Happened to like I happened to really like this top. it does show some back, but looked cute with high waisted jeans. i happened to like the raw hemline and found it quite comfortable and cute. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, and the size small fit well, though i could have gone with a medium for a much looser look."
1," I really wanted to like this since i've purchased previous byron lars dresses and have never not been complimented on them. however, the picture on this one is misleading. the colors are extremely bright, which on my pale skin makes me look washed out. for example, the border on the collar is actually more hot pink where in the picture here it appears almost white. the brightness and business just didn't work on me. that being said it still fit like a glove. 5'11 and 145 pounds and the size 4 wa"
1,"Ok, but not awesome There comes a point where i have to draw the line with things i purchase... i ordered this as i didn't have a black skirt, but thought ti wasn't special enough, don't get me wrong, it fits nicely, and is comfortable, but i was wowed. 0p or xs p fir perfectly, 26.5 in waist and 115 lbs. if you want ta nice casual skirt, the sale price is a good fir for the skirt, just wasn't enough for me :-)"
0,"So pretty but fit is off This dress is everything i hoped it would be--bright, colorful, quality jacquard, classic silhouette. unfortunately it runs small up top on the bust and i couldn't even zip it up all the way. returning :("
1,"Modern vintage Every byron lars dress that i have is definitely beyond ordinary and this one is no exception. i love the petals that adorn the front.  my dress was back ordered for a couple of months but it was well worth the wait. i wore it recently and received compliments galore. if you're undecided about this one, go for it!!!  it's a winner."
1,"A showstopper! I bought this dress on a whim one day, even though i wasn't sure where i would wear it, but i just had to have it. this dress fits beautifully, and is very flattering. i am 5'9 and typically a size 14 with large hips, behind, and a smaller waist. the 12 fit me very well--snugged in all the right places and just right everywhere else. i ended up wearing this to a benefit and i received many compliments. go for it!"
1,"Love love love! I have the ""charisma sheath"" by the same designer and love it so much i thought i'd try this one. looks so much better in person than in the picture. it's extremely flattering on my curve less frame. whenever i wear it to work, i get stopped and asked where i got it. great dress, you'll love it more in real life!"
1,"Weird bulge in the back zipper? I just scoured the other reviews to see if anyone mentioned this, so maybe i got a defected item, but on my size 6 dress (eagerly awaited), there is a big bulge on the upper back. my husband suggested it was designed for a hunchback - that's really the only explanation. the back seems tall in general, like 2-3 inches above a normal neckline. i tried pulling it down a bit, spreading my shoulders out, folding the top over - all with minimal results. i have a size 4 coming too (20% off discount arr"
0,"Too loose on top I was planning to order it online but someone returned it to my local store and i tried it on.............. my regular size is 6. i have another byron lars dress size 6 that fits me like a glove. this dress fits beautifully from the waist down. the top part is very loose and at least a size too big. very disappointing. i am not sure if it is just me or this particular dress, but it was not flattering. :("
1,"Charming and basic I got the tan one. my friend got the same skirt. she's tiny, i'm not (i have hips). we both got a size 6, and it fit us both. it just sits higher on my waist than it does on hers (above my navel - not above hers). i do have a small waist. the skirt has a lot of movement, but isn't poofy. it is not see-through. it has that retailer charm, where it looks pretty basic but is really flattering and charming. a new wardrobe staple. can dress it up or down. only problem is the zipper in the back -"
1,"Beautiful unique dress I love this dress. the pattern/print is very different than most of the dresses i own. i'm 5'1"" 106lbs and the 0p fit perfectly. it's a delicate dress. its very fitted in the skirt portion. the top is more of a knit fabric that has some give to it."
1,"Amazing style I wore this to my retirement party; i wanted something special for a once in a lifetime event. i wanted something that was dressy, while also being unique so i wouldn't look like everyone else. almost without exception, from my boyfriend to everyone i talked with, mentioned my dress. the design is so unique, making me feel even more special on my special day. it's beautiful, yet comfortable. the stretchy sides made it feel snug without pinching or discomfort. really a fun dress to wear. i'm sure"
0,"So disappointed. I was very shocked to receive this dress with a rusty zipper, looks like crusty white rust . see attached pictures. the dress fabric is very nice and i did try it on and it is a very nice fit, lined with a little stretch but my gosh what a cheap poor quality zipper that looks like it was old and exposed to moisture because the metal parts have a white crusty substance! retailer you really need to check your merchandise before sending to your loyal customers. lately the quality has been declining a"
1,"After a tailor fixes the back, it'll be great I have no need for this dress but had to have it. i read the reviews and when there was a sale weekend, pulled the trigger on it. just as reviewers noted, it's very flattering. from the front. and, just as another reviewer noted, the back torso is widely misshapen, creating a hunchback look. but i figured a good tailor could make it right. it's going to cost just under 2 jacksons to do it. which is about how much the discount was for the sale. but i expect to have this dress for years and can't"
1,"Pretty plaid I'm so glad i saw this pretty dress on sale as my eye overlooked when it was introduced. i have to agree with the previous reviewer that the zipper on this adorable dress is yucky to grab and zip. i also wish there were pockets but it's not a deal breaker. perfect dress for autumn/winter especially with a thin layer to wear underneath as the armholes are cut a bit large, showing my side boob and bra. i had to go two sizes up because 10p was sold out. skirt profile looks a little too wide, so i'l"
1,Cute Cute design for a casual top. however it was a little snug on the bust for a medium. i returned it
1,"Nice basic skirt It's a pretty, low-key, no fuss skirt. i prefer the ivory color because the details are more visible (there are different designs in the same hue). the zipper is very thick and sturdy, a bonus. size 2 regular fit me well, the hem falls right above my knees (i'm 5'2"", 26 waist, 36 hips), perfect for work and play. a touch of linen keeps the fabric cool for summer, but it doesn't wrinkle. for the price and the name like ""thera,"" i expect more flair to match its mediterranean name. for those who do"
1,"Nice summer skirt I usually wear an 8, which wasn't available, and sized up to the 10 which fit just fine as there is no stretch and it's a set-in waist band. the fabric is pretty, the skirt is fully lined, the length is not too short, and the only thing i don't like is the big bronzey toothed zipper - it looks ok on the beige version, but on the black it stands out.

it's perfect for summer but i could also see wearing the black version during holidays."
1,Pretty dress I got the white with black print and it is nice material and a pretty dress. i just would have preferred a better cut but overall pretty work dress .
1,"Almost great dress I really like this dress. buying it during retailer weekend helps me to like it more. the fabric is lovely. i like the popover styling. its slightly boxy, but not oversized. the sleeves do puff a little bit and i wish they didn't, but that's not a deal breaker. the shoulders are cut a little small, so it can be a challenge to take off. i usually wear a medium or an 8 in most retailer brands. i ordered this in a medium and it fit true to size."
1,"Perfect summer staple This is my first romper and i am in love.  so comfortable and easily dressed up or down.  i am usually an xs, small, or petite small in retailer brands.  the xs worked best for me.  the petite small was too big.  i am 5'2"" and the length of the xs is perfect ankle length.  i was nervous to put it in the washer on delicate cycle but it came out perfectly."
1,"Unexpected surprise I'm a big fan of the ""idea of"" jumpsuits and rompers, but so often they go wrong. this one was an unexpected surprise. i'm 5'10"", size 8-10/medium, and the medium fit well and was actually super flattering. the waist is cinched just so that it's very slimming. the roll tab cuff is a cute touch and is probably 2"" higher on me than the model, but adorable none the less. great quality too. love!"
1,"Delicate fabric and easy design The cotton silk blend fabric is beautiful and breathes well. i wouldn't have given this dress a thought based on the online pics, but in person i found it femine, pretty and comfortable for an outdoor garden party i'm attending. it isn't too short when i sit or bend over and with some funky, colorful jewelry i really liked it. i enjoy the slightly puffy, gathered shoulder. i did size down so the dress wouldn't be too blowzy but mostly b/c i wanted a tighter fit and it still hides my belly."
0," There isn't a whole lot that i did like about this dress. the shoulders have large poufs, the fabric isn't very soft, and it's not flattering. maybe with a belt i could be tempted, but i wasn't too fond of the dress."
1,"Perfect jumpsuit! I have been looking for the perfect jumpsuit and this is it! i am 5'7.5"" and 122 lbs and the small is a perfect fit! the fabric is super comfy, you can wear a regular bra (yay!) and it can be dressed up or down! i am looking forward to taking this on my european vacation in august! the blue is a very pretty blue but i opted for the black!"
1,Love this beautiful dress! I almost always return dresses after trying them at home but not this one! i love it and can't wait to get it back from the dry cleaner. the shoulders are really stylish and the dress is super comfortable. it has pockets which is also a bonus.  i told my husband that i want to bring it to a seamstress and have it duplicated in another fabric because i love it so much.
1,Love this dress I was returning an in line order from same designer and saw this dress. i love it. much prettier in person. this will get well worn by me!
1,"Fabulous easy jumpsuit This is the third jumpsuit i've ordered and written a review for this season. this jumpsuit is the best by far. i bought it in my usual size small (32d--31-38) and it fit me, even though i'm tall (5' 8.5""). i would say it looks much the same as it does on the model, maybe an inch shorter in the legs on me. love that the legs are rolled up by a tab and a snap--no uncomfortable elasticized legs. i am more legs than long torso (i usually wear a 33"" inseam with flats). the jumpsuit is very easy to g"
0,"Disappointing This is such beautiful material, but the sleeves at the shoulders are terrible -- the gathered material makes it look like i'm wearing shoulder pads. that structured element compared to the rest of the dress (relatively unstructured) just looks ridiculous. i was so looking forward to this dress, and now it's going back."
1," This runs tts - maybe a little on the large side. i typically wear between a small and a medium (or 6 and 8), and the small was a perfect fit. this is my second jumpsuit and i always worry about how easy they are to pull down for restroom breaks. (i drink a ton of water) this one is relatively easy - it has a button at the back neck that you have to unfasten and it's super easy and not awkward at all. i love how you can dress this up with heels for a night out or pair with sandals for a more cau"
0,"Oversized pillowcase I'm so disappointed this dress didn't work out! i ordered the size medium, post baby i'm a solid dress size 6 or 8 depending on the designer.
the cashier was laughing with me how ridiculously huge this garment was when i held it up. 

also the length was super long, description says 35"" which would be mid thigh for me, but this thing hit me mid knee. also, like the previous review the shoulders are tented and poofy. so bizarre and the cut reminds me of a maternity dress, but the shoulders def"
1,"Beautiful spring dress Cute spring dress. fit can be a little challenging if you have a full bust. however, print is so beautiful. the material is soft. i liked the puff in the sleeve. it made the look more unique."
0,"So beautiful but impossible Gorgeous dress, but so low in front and in back...i couldn't figure out how to pull it off without a cardigan/sweater. beautiful fabric and color."
1, I love this jumpsuit! it runs a little large but still works for me. it makes it super comfy and a great piece for every day!
1,Fun pants These are such fun pants. it's a heavier denim without being so stiff. they run tts. i got my usual size 26 & they fit comfortably. i haven't washed them yet but once i do i typically wash in cold gentle cycle & hang dry.
1,"Beautiful I've never worn a romper before but decided to give this one a try because i'm loving the colors/pattern. i'm so glad i did! it's even cuter on and very flattering! my only complaint is the buttons. i wish it was easier to remove and put on especially since this is a romper afterall. still, this is a beautiful piece!"
1,"Strange fit... Strange fit if you have a short torso. i ordered a medium petite and the drop waist looked strange, so i tried using a belt and it bunched up. returned the dress. why should a nice simple dress like this create such hard work?!"
0,"Fabric great - difficult to put on I know rompers typically aren&amp;#39;t the easiest and while i loved this fabric this was a pain to put on no zipper, etc. and the buttons are tiny and since the fabric doesnt stretch it is difficult to even try on. the length of the shorts was great and the fit was just ok all in all i don&amp;#39;t think it is worth the price."
0,"So close to the perfect spring dress! This was exactly what i was looking for: a spring dress i could wear while it was still cool out. loved the colors, pattern, and the fact that it could hide a belly bulge. but i got it in a petite small, and i was swimming in it. i got it in an xs, and the body of it was just right, but the bust was so tight i nearly ripped it trying to climb out (and i'm a barely an a cup). i don't normally have this problem with dresses, but in this case the top and bottom half of the dress felt like they were"
1,"Cute, feminine dress I really like this dress. it is cute, but not too frilly. i purchased in the store and they only had a petite (i am 5'6"", so not a petite), but it fit - a little short but not too crazy. can be dressed up or down. the material and the print are really lovely."
1,Perfect for a socal thanksgiving Like the other reviewer said it&#39;s hard to get on and i had to size down like i often do at retailer. but it&#39;s so pretty and it&#39;s not too short like most rompers. we host thanksgiving every year and i&#39;m so excited to find an alternative to a dress/pants so i can work &amp; cook in style.
1,"Great dress The fabric is a nice weight jersey. i prefer to wear the dress backwards as the back of the dress has a moderate v and the round neck (which is actually the front of the dress) makes for a very flattering back. the skirt part of the dress is full but the jersey fabric falls in such a way that does not cause the silhouette to look ""hippy"". this is not a dress that fits close to the body through the torso, so if you're looking for that you might consider going down a size."
1, The fabric making this dress is great quality- heavyweight and so soft against the skin. the design is near perfect with an extraordinarily flattering silhouette that hangs just right from the hips with poof or flare. the fateful flaw is in the neckline; a broad boat shape that looks awkward couples with a corset-like torso that acts as a push up bra. not for larger busted woman (34d here) and certainly not suitable for work.
1,"Compliments all day long Absolutely love this dress! i ended up wearing it backwards to work for a more modest neckline, but flipped it around for an evening night out. can't recommend it enough - two of my colleagues ordered it that day."
0,"Runs small in waist, sleeves and big in shoulders This dress felt small in torso and waist and suffocating in sleeves ( i do have average athletic arms). but the shoulders were cut so wide that one side was falling off, as i fix, one shoulder, another will slide down.
the material is nice but since it is not lined, it feels inexpensive, disposable."
1,"Buy this dress! I thought this dress looked cute online and was excited to try it on at my local retailer. it fits so well and is very flattering! i really like the material. 

the only thing for me is that i have long arms so the sleeves have to get pushed up, but it looks like that's how it's supposed to be."
1,"Gorgeous dress! I love the look of this dress when it's on. the only issue i have with it is that the inside of the dress is white, which shows through on the chest slightly, but it's such a pretty dress and such an overall great fit, that i'm keeping it anyway!"
0,"Odd back pockets I have several pairs of coh and love them all. when i saw these go on sale in my size i quickly purchased them. however, when i tried them on at home and looked in the mirror, i was pretty shocked that the back pockets were extremely long. meaning, they go well below your butt cheeks (like 3""# which means they look like they are sitting too low on your body-and they aren't they are actually i little higher waisted than most coh! 

i thought perhaps it was my perception that day, so i waited an"
0,"I got lost in this dress I was very excited when this dress arrived in the mail. the fabric is so comfortable, but the print was overwhelming. it is also very tight on the top and i got lost in the fabric at the bottom. i had to return it."
1,"Unexpected surprise! I did not intend on buying this dress, as i had taken two others that i had seen on-line into the dressing room. i actually saw the black version of this dress first, and was a bit disappointed that it wasn't available in my size. so, i thought i would try this on just for size. i was totally shocked as to how cute it looked on! i had taken both the xs and the s into the dressing room. the xs was very tight fitting in the arms and chest. i am very small busted, and normally wear a xs in tops and"
1,"Runs a little big for hd Agree with other reviewers : this dress is surprisingly nice weight/quality fabric. it's also very swingy. i find i am usually a size 10 in hd in paris items (m in deletta and s/m in meadow rue, for comparison) since i'm a 34d i find hd in paris items to leave too little room for larger busts so i size up. in this dress i'm going to try for the m, since the l i ordered was too big, the swingyness leaves lots of room if you are an hourglass shape and the sleeves were roomy without being too big."
0,"Adorable! but sheds like crazy I was so so excited to get this sweater in the mail. unfortunately, the sweater is lined with the same material (very soft and warm btw) as the polka dots, which sheds like crazy. i wore a white tshirt under this for the first time, and my shirt was covered in black fuzz by the end of the day. so much so that i was gathering balls of it to be thrown away. very disappointed. a lint roller can't even clean up the tshirt.

in terms of sizing, this fits tts, i normally wear a l or xl, got this in an"
0,"Nicely made, colorful Well made dress, but too much fabric for my taste. it lays a little heavy on the body & does not give a slimming affect. the colors are vibrant & pretty, but the dress is too long, as well. as other reviewers have said, the front is too low cut, but turn it around and it looks & feels better. didn't work for me, sadly, i'll be returning it."
0,"Not for long torsos I adored this suit - the style, the colors, the thick quality of the fabric...but unfortunately the bottom seams cut into my groin and backside so much, it was practically painful! i'm 5'7', 128 lbs, and usually wear a size small, but was advised to size up. even with the medium i tried on, everything fit well but the length, though i've never thought i had a long torso. sizing up to a large would make the bust way to large for my small b chest. was so sad to return this suit!"
1, Very comfy! can wear the dress both ways! the front is a deep swoop neck cut. the back is a v-neck cut. i flipped the dress around to the v-neck was more flattering on me due to having a smaller chest. got an size 4.
1,"Not for me, but nice in general The material of this dress is really thick and substantial. very soft and it has good movement. the cut was not quire right for my body, unfortunately. but on the right person, this would be very nice. i think a lot of different body types would look great in this dress, depending on where the waist hits etc."
1,"Get this dress before it's gone! The material is a medium weight jersey knit that is slightly thicker so it provides enough coverage and support to be flattering without being bulky. i think this dress is true-to-size, or maybe runs a little bit big, but only by a little bit. i bought a medium and am a size 8 in tops and 10 in pants. the dress hugs nicely on the upper body (arms, chest, ribs) and flares just a little bit on the hips/tummy/butt area. it is forgiving of little bumps or lumps. the scoop neckline is a bit lower tha"
1,Great style and colors I am five four and one hundred and twenty pounds and the small fits me perfectly with enough room in the arms and chest. i am a 34c. the red is gorgeous and sweet. got it on line sale and worth it
1,"Beautiful colors I love the overall look and feel of the dress. my only complaint is that it was shorter and lower cut in person than it looked on the model and i'm not tall. i ordered a small and i'm 5""4 130 lbs bottom heavy. the skirt is perfectly flowy and hides my problem areas really well; however, i will need to wear a camisole with it to hide cleavage that will show otherwise."
1,"Fun work/weekend dress I bought this dress in both the red and black motifs and love them both. i'm 5'7"" and usually a medium, but i found the medium to run a little larger than expected. it's fine if you want the dress to hang looser on your body, otherwise, consider trying it a size down."
1," Nice, easy to wear dress!"
0,"Broad shouldered I love simple pull-on jersey dresses and so i had to try this one. unfortunately, it did not work out. fit is tts, i liked the fabric which is soft, silky yet with some weight to it, and i appreciated the thoughtful construction with multiple well placed darts in the chest. the skirt is lovely, swingy but not too full, hangs well. what stopped me from purchasing it is the fit in the shoulders, it was too broad for me and gave the dress an overall awkward shape. the neckline was also a little too"
1,Flattering and fun The dress is very comfortable and the fit is very flattering. i really like the colors and the design. the only con is that it isn't lined.
1," Rarely do i find tops that fit similar to the model in the picture. my body type is no comparison. i am 5'5"" and about 170# with 30"" waist. this sweater in a large fit perfectly where the back lining and ruffle fell right at the top of my bottom which was very flattering. not to short and not long over bottom. just right. bought in cream and wish i would have bought in both colors..........."
1,"Great!!!! I purchased this dress in the raspberry for my best friend's bridal shower and it was such a hit! i got it for the $60 sale price with the additional 40% off sale items that retailer loves so much- it came to $41! i paired it with a chunky gold necklace and it was adorable! so many compliments! i'm typically a medium through and through and this fit me true to size as well. 5'6"", between 135-140lbs. the cut of the dress fit me perfectly and the material is amazing. i'd definitely purchase this!"
1,"Cute, easy dress Cute, easy to wear dress. personally i think it looks better with a belt, or something to accentuate the waist. otherwise it's a lot of fabric in the middle. i didn't think the top was too low as others have mentioned. though, it is possible to wear backwards (with a v neck front) if that bothered you. nice length, long enough for work."
1,"Seea and be seen! I discovered seea bathing suits last year and fell in love. i currently own two - the hermosa surf suit and the . seea zuma. for reference: i am 5'7"", 135 pounds, 34c, 28 waist. dress size 4-6. pants 6-8. jeans 28. if you have questions about sizing, there is a great reference on seea's website on how to size. if you are taller than the reference sizing they provide, but still the same measurements as another size mentioned, they suggest sizing up as the suits are typically made for surfing/padd"
0,"Too large The dress is too big. i got size 4, after checking the measurements chart (for reference: 5'7"", 125 lb). it is too wide, not as fitted as in the picture. the cut is too deep (might work better for a bustier lady, but looks pathetic on me). 

the pattern is too bright, much brighter that in the picture (i got red pattern). it's not that the photos represent the colors inaccurately, it's just... the colors are much more vibrant in real life.

the material is heavier than i expected."
1,"Love this dress! This is such a cute dress! the skirt is very full but does not add visual weight to those of us who already have enough actual weight. i ordered the black/beige print and the fabric is beautiful. it really drapes and hangs nicely. because there is so much fabric, i don't think this dress needs a lining. it seems to wash and hang dry well. i'm 5'4"", about 160 lbs. i like the way the medium fit. the length was slightly above the knee, which was ok with me (i'm nearly 60.) all in all, i can see mys"
1,"Pretty The fabric is great and the cut is flattering. i have dds, so it pulls a little in the middle. you can just cut from the inside to release the pulling thread."
1,"Flattering! I agree with the other reviews - it's a little small in the arms, low cut in the chest, but really broad in the shoulders. i bought the xsp, which is a size up from my normal xxsp. they didn't have xxsp to compare. and i am a small person with big athletic shoulders, and my usual problem is with things being tight in the shoulders and fit everywhere else. overall, an excellent buy at the sale price. size up for more room in the chest and arms."
1," Great dress. the seaming helps add shape to the dress. it is flattering and super comfortable. this dress is so easy to wear, i'm sure i will reach for it again and again."
1,"Super soft and sweet I loved the details on the top of the shirt but was especially excited by the length of the top - it comes just over the hips and gives a flattering fit, as well as the sweet little micro sleeves. the color is kind of worn looking but it is so soft. i will definitely wear this a lot. 
 
i bought a medium but probably could've gotten away with a small."
1,"A bit if a challange I am going to keep it. i think it will be a great ""throw on and go"" piece you can wear with many different types of shoe/sandal. the detail on top is excellent and it is a flattering cut. two complaints: runs a little big on bottom, a little ""genie"" looking...like there is too much fabric above the elastic around your upper ankles. but the bigger issue is that there is no zipper or elastic on top so slipping the top over your shoulders is super tight, to the point i thought i was going to rip it"
0,"Feminine but bad pattern and colors I was attracted to the feminine design of the dress, the silhouette, the flouncy skirt; however, i ordered the red motif pattern and hated the splotchy, dark colors."
1," Love it! as a previous reviewer stated, you can actually wear it reversible.
so happy i purchased it!"
1,"Super flattering I find it very hard to find a dress. never like the way they look on me..this one???? fits like a glove, flatters my silhouette (which is difficult because even though i am at a good weight my waist is never small). looks like million bucks on me....i love it!!!"
1,"Super comfortable dress with flattering colors I bought this dress online and have to say the material is really soft, has a great weight to it, and i bought it in the red motif. i just wore it to work this past week and received a ton of compliments on it. i wore it with black nylons black heels, and a cropped leather jacket. it is so figure flattering and so comfortable to wear. i typically range in size from an xs to a s, and the s fit me the best. i'm 5'9"" and 130 lb. it is truly a lovely dress!"
1,"Versatile! I was pleasantly surprised by this dress. it goes perfectly from work to drinks and i receive tons of compliments on it. i pair it with a thin belt and heels or booties depending on the occasion. i ordered a small, it is a little big, but the fabric is stretchy (i am 5'4"" 125lbs). this dress accentuates my upper half, while disguising my lower half--thanks, dress!"
1,"Mighty little midi This very lightweight and semi-sheer dress fits like a midi dress on my height. the back hem ends low calf and the front hem is below knee. straps are adjustable and bodice edge is elasticized. the print is pretty and can pair with any sweater or jacket or jewelry or shoes that hits your fancy. my concern is regarding the 100% rayon fabric and how it will hold up after cleaning as all of my 100% rayon clothing from *random fast fashion retailer* does not last long. i'm 5'3"" 140# 39-28-35 and hap"
1,"Beatiful and great quality for the price I have been looking for lace shorts for years. yes, years! finally found these shorts that are perfect. the lace is sturdy, not flimsy, so they are not see-through. i purchased both the cream and the blue when they went on sale. my skin is a bit tan, so lighter-colored clothing can be see-through for me. both colors are fantastic and i get compliments on them all the time, especially the blue shorts. plus, they complement either a t-shirt or a blouse. i love the eyelash fringe at the hem - such"
0,"Too low cut for petites I tried this in my normal sp. i found it to run a little snug, but the neckline was way too low for every-day wear."
1,Cute go to dress Super easy date or work dress. it's a little small in the bust so i had to size up but otherwise a great fit.
1,"Very nice casual top I love love this top. it is a very pretty casual top. it looks very nice on and is more like a tunic. perfect with jeans, very casual but the embroidery, ruffle sleeves, and buttons at the top add a nice touch. i have the red, i am considering buying this in blue as well, i have so many newly purchased blue tops!"
1,Love!!! I love this kimono. it fits great. and is gorgeous!!
1,"Love love love this I love this sweater dress. i got the ivory color in a size small. i'm a size 6 & 5'5"". i feel in love with it while shopping with a friend, who kind of rolled her eyes at it. i went back later because i knew i loved it. since the ones on the sale rack were covered with dust and dirt at the hem. i ordered it on line in m & small and the small fit better. it is so soft, and the color is great."
1,"Very pretty coat but runs extremely huge I thought this coat was absolutely unique when i first laid my eyes on it, i saw it on a co-worker on thanksgiving 2015, her coat was in navy blue pattern, mine was grey, but looked very good on and let me say the way she wore the coat, it looked oversize on her. my co worker is a very skinny size xs-s woman with very slim slender curve-less figure unlike mine. we are about the same height but i'm a bit taller with curves (6ft, 160lb). i normally wear size l 10. i like my outfits lose, but after"
1,"Beautiful wardrobe addition Even at 5'1"" this kimono works for me. because it's so light in weight the length and amount of fabric are not at all overwhelming. it can be dressy or casual, as others have noted."
0," I loved how this looked on the model, however, once i tried on in store, i was greatly disappointed. i usually wear a meduim and the small and extra-small were huge on me. there was so much extra material that i was swimming in this. i had such high hopes for this. there were no petite sizes to try on in the store but i am not sure it would have helped."
1,Nice but not in love A good sweater but something about it was just not right for me. just didn't feel like i would wear it.
0,"Thinking of returning This dress has been one that i just adored online and in the store so i was happy when i bought it on sale. i have worn this dress one time, thinking that i would love it. the problem is that as i wore it, the dress continued to stretch out of shape and just did nothing for my curvy bottom half. the dress just looked pulled and stretched out of shape. i would say that it may be the yarn and that it has too much give or at least more give than i want."
1,"Gorgeous colors The colors and design are stunning in person. it is one-size and as most kimonos go it is billowy and flowing, and not fitted. i plan to wear it with a pair of black shorts and also with black leggings. i love the idea of layering this over shorts. i have a similar kimono and wear it as a bating suit cover-up. the long kimono over short looks fresh and modern and gives you the option to have some coverage when you want it. also, really pops over simple black leggings and black top. it's light an"
1,"My new favorite! Let me start off my saying that i hate pants. i will wear dresses and skirts whenever possible to avoid them. however, i found these at my local retailer and just had to try them on because the pattern was so adorable. i have another pair of pilcro shorts that i love because they are so comfortable and have so much stretch to them that they don't make me crazy like other pants do. these were no exception! i love everything about them and am going to have a hard time not wanting to wear them every"
1,"So chic! This is a wow! so chic...reminds of something i would have bought in paris. worth every penny. even my husband loves it on me...his words were ""it's a standout"". i work in the design industry so i am always looking for something that represents what i do...nailed it!"
1,"Inconsistant fit! I was so excited to try this dress, but after ready the reviews,i though they were all over the place! i descided to order my typical retailer size small. i'm 5'6"" , 134 lbs, and wear a size 6. well, it was a snug fit! i have a slim build and this was just to snug for my taste. i imagine a medium would have been better. however, i was very surprised by the length and slit... the dress hit at my knee cap with the slit going all the way up to mid thigh... .!?? i've seen pics of this dress on instagr"
1,"Beautiful chemise This is a very soft and feminine chemise. it is a little more see thru than i had anticipated, but i still love it!"
1,"Sultry meets sophisticated Beautiful material- and washable!! i'm vertically challenged and the slits are a tad bit high, even for me- but still tasteful. i would suggest sizing down as i'm normally a medium in retailer but due to the nature of the material i opted to size down and i'm so glad i did!! no arm hole struggles with my particular dress either. overall just a really cute, versatile, cozy and functional option that will certainly get plenty of exposure for many winters to come."
0,"Unimpressed I was so excited for this kimono. i thought the colors would be lovely. i was looking for a unique wrap/vest/kimono. i ordered this online expecting to be dazzled. sadly, i was not. this arrived and fell short on all measures. the colors were flat, the fabric felt cheap and the construction did not scream $108. it felt like something i would find in a college import/head shop. back it went. i ended up buying the silves wrap, which i love."
1,"Giant! Im normally a medium across the board for outerwear. (5'8"" and 135 lbs) this jacket looked giant from the photos so i bought a small. when i first tried it on i thought no way, it's gotta go back. it was enormous and the fit was rather awkward. i looked like the size of a house from all angles. ha! i was still in love with the color and print. as i wore it around the house it began to loose it's rigidity and form against my body in places. it is definitely a jacket you got to play around with. d"
1,Beautiful kimono Love this kimono! it is so versatile. it is a one size only so it might be .a bit volumnous for some people.
1,"Super cute! First off, let me say that i am 52 and don't often go for print jeans these days:) however, these are just so stinking fun and flattering that i couldn't say no. these look great cuffed for warmer temps, and rolled to full length will be fun to wear with fall sweaters. if you are looking for something fun and flattering, these are the ticket! i bought the grey version and feel that they will work with many pieces that i already have."
1,"Super sexy perfect fit! I didn't have high hopes for these, because things seem to 'ride' on me- but these stay put! and i love the adjustable sides... these are a pretty color, i ordered the raspberry and the silver grey and love both! i normally would not pay a ton for undies, but these are worth every dollar! i have a larger bottom, so purchased the large, but sometimes i can wear medium, so this is great, being adjustable."
1,"Love this dress, but had to return I am 5""7"" and weigh 123 lbs. i tried on both these dresses in medium, and they both fit. they are not too thin, not too high slit, not scratchy. the problem is i am middle aged with a thick waist. the waist looked lumpy with the close fit knit. if you are younger, slim and tall, you will love it. i sent it back with regrets. hope this helps."
1, This is a lovely little nightie. i am a size 8 and i bought the medium and it fits perfect. it's soft and lightweight and not as see thru as i thought it would be. very light and airy and the sale price was great!!!
1," I tried this on in the store. all of the dresses in the store were misshapen and pulled long in the armholes (and i love all of my local retailer stores!) i don't think these should be hung on a hanger. the knit is too heavy for hanging. the hem on the dress i tried in the store was dirty from dragging on the floor. i went home and ordered it online with the 20% dress discount and free shipping. the dress i received was clean, unstretched in the armholes and not oddly short like some review"
1,"Beautiful and soft Based on the mixed reviews about fit, i waited to purchase until i could try it on in the store and was not disappointed. i'm wondering if there are different batches of this dress? i'm 5'7 and the dress fit as in the photo. the side slits come above my knees but not too high. arm holes are a bit large so if you want more coverage this may not be for you. the material is cozy and soft. the cream color is gorgeous. size wise, it definitely looks boxy and marshmallow-like if too loose. i am usuall"
0,"Definitely not my best look I bought this online in my usual size (petite xxs) for in-store pickup. when i tried it on, the kindest word to describe it would be ""voluminous""--it was at least 2 sizes too big on me. i looked like i had taken grandma's tablecloth and constructed a homemade blouse. the blouse comes with an attached cami, which was also way too big for me. the color is not white (as described), but rather an ivory/cream color--definitely not the best shade for my light olive skin. i do think that it looks lovel"
1, I ordered the chelan wrap coat in the beautiful red color. it's artsy and will be fun to wear with jeans and other casual clothing. it's super comfy and fits true to size.
0,"No shape I wanted to love this dress, however it has no shape to it. it is also somewhat see through, so something needs to be worn under it. i feel like i received a dress that has been stretched out and returned. i'm extremely disappointed. i do not recommend."
1," I'm usually wary of light colored knits because they can often be thin and see through, but this one had nothing for me to worry about. this had an adequate thickness which does not leave me freezing and i did not consider it sheer. i find that the sleeveless turtleneck design can be versatile for the seasons. i plan to wear it with a cropped denim jacket and boots for colder days and sandals on warmer days. the material is very soft. the cut is true to size to large. i went true to size because"
1,"The only fall dress you need The cream color in this dress is divine. such a stunning dress that can be worn with a vest, jacket or alone. it looks very luxe and expensive in the cream color. because it's a knit, can go smaller in size. i tried on both the x-small and small. opted to go with the x-small. found it fit better."
1,"Stunning I did not notice this dress on the website. it was not until i saw it in store (was an online purchase & returned) - i was immediately in love. i love the color, texture and rosettes. i feel like a million bucks wearing it and have received so many compliments on it. before buying it, i actually ran home to gather a previous purchase and return it so i could buy this dress and not feel guilty! i am usually a 2 or 4 and the 6 fits perfect through and through. so happy with this lovely dress!"
1,"So cozy Tried on my normal size in the store and i was swimming in it. the sales associate suggested i order the petite in store. perfect! i just wish there were more opportunities to try on petite sizes in store.
this coat is soft and roomy. when it's buttoned up it has a great shape too."
0,"Almost, but not quite This dress had so much potential but the horizontal knit ruined it. i tried on size xxs in grey since my usual petite xxs size was not available. the fabric was a good weight and dress was well constructed. however, the wide horizontal knit made the dress bulge out at places especially in the lower body thus made me look wide and bulky. i wish they had used a cable knit pattern which will make the dress drape much more nicely and more flattering."
1,The best This trench coat is the best fit and feel-true to size and cozy! excellent material!
1,"This one is on repeat! I bought this kimono only a couple weeks ago...and i think i've worn it six times already! this kimono is stunning. light, airy and the colors are absolutely gorgeous. the print is unique and bold. i've worn this over a black dress...with leggings and a white tank...with denim and every color top. the options are endless with this beauty! the only downside is the kimono is so airy and oversized that the armholes easily get hooked on things. i ripped it once but thankfully it was right down the s"
0," I thought this dress looked gorgeous on the model. so floaty and light. when it came, i found it to be the exact opposite. the hem is so heavy and laid on me like a potato sack. it had way too much material at the bottom and weighed me down unfortunately."
1,"Perfect for fall I got this coat because i needed something black and thought the plaid was black. it's not -- but that's my fault and i love it anyway! it's perfect for our temperate seattle fall and winter -- not too light, not too heavy. i get a ton of compliments! i'm 5'9"" and about 145, and a medium fits perfectly."
0,Wanted to love... I really wanted to love this sweater. the quality is good and it looks beautiful - until you need to lift your arms. i did end up keeping it but it is limited to when and where i can wear it due to the arm restrictions. i can see it in the picture but didn't notice until purchasing - the arm holes and right next to the bottom of the sweater. slight design flaw.
1,"Beautiful colors I own several of retailer's kimonos, & this has to be the prettiest. the colors are rich & more beautiful in person. i can't wait to pair this with jeans & shorts this summer!"
1,Beautiful coat I love this coat. i would definitely recommend it. i normally wear a size 6 or a medium. i bought my normal size and had to return it for a small. customer service was great and made for an easy online exchange.
1,"Great fit, nice summer color in the lighter denim The lighter tinted denim is a faded blue-grey that will go perfectly with most of my wardrobe, and is more summery than the usual dark denim i wear. these feel like stretchy jeans to me, not leggings. i wear size 28 in most jeans and these fit tts. really nice."
1,Great but huge! This coat is very nice. it's soft and the colors are great. the only reason i gave it a 4 stars and not 5 is that it runs huge! i normally wear a size small to medium in tops and i like a bit of moving room in my coats so i ordered a medium. when i put it on i just started laughing. it was so huge. i wanted to exchange it for an xs to see if that would have been small enough but it has already sold out in that size. i think this could be a big win for larger sizes but unfortunately for me it did
1," I love this sweater. i bought it in navy at this sale price and now plan on ordering it in the cream color. it runs a tad large and it might even stretch just a teensy bit (but not a lot), however i adore sweaters to be a little too big so this is perfect for me. whenever i wear this sweater i get huge compliments, to the end that the friends wants to go online and order it for herself. tkhe only problem with the sweater is that i love it so much, i want to wear it every single day (which is why"
1,"Beautiful, if a bit bulky It is gorgeous, and yes, the side slits are very high, but i am still keeping and rocking it. i am a size 10-12 and got the large, probably could have got the medium, but after a few washings, i think the larger size will be ok. side slits high, but if the weather is good, and you have self tanner on legs, it looks great with shortie boots. i have gotten many cmpliments on it, just hope it still keeps its shape after a long day of wear. very pretty in cream, though, i do recommend it. i am 5'8,"
1,"Flattering style, too small I love the way the mock neck style looks, but the shirt is cut very small. i realize it's supposed to stretch, but it's still very, very tight on, particularly in the shoulder area. if you like the style, i'd recommend sizing up."
1, I love this top. i'm wearing it today. i bought it to wear under blazers and it works perfectly. i knew it would be slim fitting and while i normally buy med or sometimes small i bought the large and i'm glad i did. it's still form fitting without strangling me the color is very nice as well. nice fabric and well made. a great layering basic.
1,"Pretty but too tight This top was so beautiful, exactly like the image shows but the waist was so tight. it was uncomfortable enough that i am going to return it. sad because the top and arms fit great. i am an hourglass so my waist is very small compared to my top and bottom. oh well, next time!!"
1,"Sexy I can't get enough off-the-shoulder tops. so even though this is out of season, i went for it...in both colors! my only con is the fabric has a slight sheen which cheapens the look a tad. like i'd read in other reviews, it does run a bit small for this cut top - i just wanted a bit more volume in the neck hole and in the waist since i won't be tucking in. if you want it more fitted and ruched around the waist, go for your normal size. i'll be ordering a small in both colors because i know i won'"
1," I am on the fence with this one.......the black lace on the bottom is beautiful and pairs so well with my black velvet gladiator sandals..... but it came very wrinkled, and the fabric almost feels more like a cheap cotton. i am always in between a sm and med, so tried the small. the shoulders do want to slide up a bit. arms need to be down.
it is very voluminous......and falls below my bottom. would make a pretty maternity top!! the idea of it overall is pretty, but not sure i want all the volu"
1,"Coincidence I just go these socks in one of my beauty boxes!!! there is nothing like a new pair of socks. they feel amazing no matter what you do. these are ultra soft and in-line with other slipper socks i have tried with the grippies on the bottom. i like the color black style (actually, i like all the new styles at retailer right now), and i didn't think i would like the higher tabs in the back but it turns out i love them to make sure the sock is covering my whole ankle when i put my shoes on. the"
1,"Super cute top Very comfortable, flattering, washes nicely- love it!"
1,"Stylish and comfortable I love this top. very comfortable fabric and it can be worn in multiple ways. it is tight on the bottom. i usually wear an xs (5'4"" and 120 lbs). had to exchange for a small. very flattering. liked it so much i ordered it in both colors."
1,Best jeans ever! I just bought these jeans and i absolutely love them. they are my new favorites. i like them so much i am buying another pair. i am short but always wear heels and these are perfect in every way. slimming as well.
1," Love these pants! super comfy and casual. i found they run true to size and are just lose enough to feel casual, not sloppy. my only complaint, the cuffs of the jeans were thoroughly covered in some kind of animal hair! very disgusting. but love the jeans."
1, Beautiful beautiful beautiful! goes great with pilcro stet big rise grey jeans and deep green hei jeans. i wear this on shoulders vs off. so lovely . beautiful rich earth tone colors and live the lace bottom. can dress up with black skirt or black skinnies and heels. highly recommend.
1," This is my favorite pair so far from cartonnier. the side zip dresses up the pants which is something i was looking for and i just love the print. so happy with the quality, i ordered a second pair. fit true to size for me. i plan to wear them with knee high boots as it gets colder."
0,Goofy neck The quality and color is great on this top.  the neckline just seemed a be pulled a little too tight on the one side of my neck to be a true off-the -shoulder look.  and to wear it as a cowl neck (or actually looks like a boat neck) just makes it too ordinary- since i love the off the shoulder look.  it fit me everywhere else and the slim waistline of this top is super flattering- so i think my size was right.  the cut of the neckline just needed to be more more definitive one way or the other.
1,Feminine and flirty Beautiful top! you can wear it as a wide boat neck or as its pictured off the shoulder. the bottom is tight with ruching which makes it very flattering. i found the fit true to size. love the neutral light brown color. will look nice with white denim for the summer. excited to dress this unique top up or down.
0," I wanted to love this skirt it was good quality, but the front is a loose flap that is exposing so i had to return it"
1,"Don't even know they are there! I bought these to have a pair between standard fair and sexy, but these are so comfortable and gorgeous i would wear them everyday! it doesn't even feel like i am wearing anything. love these!"
1,"Nice fitting dress I just bought this nice dress on sale as i love the dolan brand and purchased my regular size small (34/27/35) and it fits me perfect so i'd say it runs tts. the material is nice and soft, not see through at all and a good length (i'm 5'4""). i bought the regular and didn't seem to need a petite. it's a slimming dress that's not overly tight too. i also really like the mock neck and don't find it constricting at all as the material has a bit of stretch. the short sleeves will be nice when it's sp"
1,"Wanted to love This was my favorite item in the august catalog & i knew i had to have it. my store had not received it yet so i ordered online. after reading the other reviews, i sized down and the fit is still much too large as this top has way too much material. this is coming from someone who loves swing tees and can appreciate a loose fit. however, this top hangs like a tent. also, the elastic around the bottom of the sleeves is quite uncomfortable. i do think the top is pretty and recommend only if you ar"
1," I love the design of this sweater...shorter length, with shorter sleeves.
goes great with jeans and has a very different look!"
1,"A casual workhorse I've worn this dress to work with a black corset belt and to disneyland as is. it's made of a medium weight knit that doesn't cling. the cut is flattering. i wish they had an option with no slits. though this alternate cut would be significantly less comfortable, it would create a sexier silhouette. i purchased this item on sale.

i'm a little worried that it'll shrink in the wash. i've had varied luck with fabric containing modal."
1,"The most perfect straight leg jean ever! I am so amazed that i finally found the perfect, straight legged denim! not too skinny nor too tight b/c i have athletic calves. i have been waiting a long time! for reference i took a size 26 and usually wear a 2. it is great and comfortable for someone my age! i love these and they are the best investment."
0,"Looks great, poor quality Pants are overpriced and very uncomfortable. to my utter dismay i wore them during a business trip for the first time and ended up with bruises caused by the side zipper. i have been a long time retailer shopper and usually my go to store, however,ending up with a pair of pants that caused me pain was a very big disappointment,"
1,"Wish'd i'd known they came in tall So, i bought these pants in mid-september while at a local retailer store - i thought they were a bit short but the salesgirl assured me they were fine. wore them soon after and then discovered they came in tall sizes as well. anyway, one they came on sale i rebought them nabbing the last tall in my size. while that is a testament for how much i love them - the fit is true to size other than the length issue. i am 5'10"" with long legs - the 28t fit me perfectly. of course they cost me more than th"
1,"Comfy and flattering I love this sweater, it is well-made, the colors are great, adn the feel is very soft. i just love troubadour, never knew of it before this season,but already own a few pirces.
i tried on the blue version, fits true to size, i don't hink i need the petite. the nexl ;ine was more falttering than the pcture shows. i love hte sleeves too. i think overall the shirt is a bit of flared out style, which i love."
0, So small! i was a solid size 12 in skirts but recently lost some weight. i was still nervous to buy a size 10 so i bought the 12 thinking i can always take it in if i have to. the 12 - which should have been big on me was tiny. this skirt is built for someone with non-existent hips. returning.
1,Cute top but very oversized Ordered my usual medium. it swallowed me. have returned to store and they ordered me a small to try. very cute comfortable top
1,Pilcro fan here This is my second pair of pilcro chinos. their pants and shorts are so soft--even those who love to run around pantless might relent. this brand tends to run a bit large so if you like your pants form fitting you may want to size down.
1,"Great fall find! Beautifully detailed top that pairs well with dark denim. top is a bit wide, but i think that is the style. a unique and different piece to add to your wardrobe!"
1," These are great-looking chinos and very comfortable. i'm 5'11"" and--unrolled--they are long enough for me."
1,"In love with this top! This top is amazing! i originally ordered it in small, which fit, but opted for a large for the option of wearing it more off or the shoulder. the large fit perfect! great length for leggings and can wear both off the shoulder or just one... can't wait for fall! for reference, i'm 135 lbs, 34b."
1,"Love these pants!! I rarely order pants on line...as the size often varies so much. took a chance on these as they were on sale and they are just stink'n adorable! i am so glad i did, i love them. i ordered both colors, haven't got the neutral pair yet but the green plaid fits me like they were made for me!! for reference i am about 5""3' tall, my weight is around 137.5 ish. i ordered the 28 regular, and they fit perfectly. i hope they don't stretch to much when i wear them. if so i will update my review.
i just lo"
1,"Great piece! I discovered this top folded on a shelf and loved the material and this brand so i decided to try it on... even though it's super hot right now in ar. i'm so glad i did and ended up finding the other color and buying both. i am 5'9"", 127#, 34b and long waisted. it is difficult to tell in the pictures how this top fits around the waist... it is snug fitting but the material is thicker so i feel like it's very flattering. i tried it on as a boat neck look, then saw online it was off the shoulder a"
1,"Best birthday shirt ever! Bought this for my daughter in college for her birthday. i heard shouts of this being her new go-to top.
her roomies have already tried to borrow it. super comfy with a beautiful off-the-shoulder style.
no one can go wrong with this!"
1,Fun top for fall! This is a great top going into the fall season. it runs a little large. i went down one size and it fits perfect!
1," I like this blouse very much but my work is extremely conservative so i chose to return it. it really pops, even though it is just black and white. it has some sparkles in it."
1,"Pilcro perfect Well, another major score with pilcro!
these pants, in general, are my go-to pants--so i had high expectations when i bought them.
(i have about every color in the hyphen cut--and always hope they make more pairs)
and, what do you know, they've met--even exceeded these expectations!

love the fit--true to size--even though i will order another smaller size when i get smaller! these are good enough to have that ""big pair"" and that ""oh, i feel svelte pair!"" the denim has just enough stretch a"
1,"Beautiful! What a perfect dress! it was perfect for a black tie optional wedding. i didn't want another ""black dress"" but when i saw this i knew it was something special! i am 5'5 130lbs and 34dd- the size 8 fit my top better but the size 6 length was better but i decided to stay with the size 8"
1,"Interesting and unique I love the way this top fits! i am busty on top and smaller on bottom, and it really flatters. it's funny to see it called ""off the shoulder"" b/c so far i have worn it on the shoulders. when worn on the shoulders, the neck is very flattering, kind of like a cowl neck. i probably would not wear it off the shoulder b/c of the whole bra strap challenge. i got the charcoal color which looks great with jeans or black leggings."
1,"Long enough for tall women Being six feet tall, i'm always combing reviews for the opinions of other tall women, and i'm glad i did on this one! with the off the shoulder look, you can sometimes gain extra length, and it's true in this case. i stayed tts because of length issues, and while it is billowy, it's not horribly so. i would think, however, if you're between sizes, or not worried about height, i'd go with the smaller option. adorable, comfy, casual while being dressy enough for a night out!"
0,"Cute but poor quality I'm 5'7"" 155lbs and ordered a large. it fit, but the arms were awkwardly short. the finish details on the end of each sleeve almost would have to be pushed back to the elbow for it to look right, which would be okay. however, the interior seam of the neckline is cut jaggedly and isn't even finished with any stitching. it's just tucked haphazardly inside the neckline and isn't sewn--it would unravel with washing. 

it's soft and snuggly and cute if you get it on super-sale and don't mind it com"
1,Darling top Love this top! off the shoulder fits great! little extra room around the torso than i'd love... but still absolutely in love with this top! the black lace detail on the bottom is amazing! love the colors for fall! ordered a small and i'm 5'9 138lbs and i ordered a small
1,"Love this skirt I read all the reviews and they were very helpful the waist does run small so i sized up which was perfect. i love how this skirt is lightweight and swingy. i cant get enough comfortable denim skirts. so size up and you will love this, i am a slightly hippy girl and the skirt did not make me look big at all."
1,"A lot to work with Other reviewers have pointed out that these tops (i have both colors now, spoilers!) run long- and i am happy to agree. basically, there's a lot to work with here. i'm always looking for longer tops to traverse a larger bust, and this is a great hip-hitting length for me. plus, the neckline can be style multiple ways. all in all, a flattering better-than-basic sweater."
1," This skirt is the perfect flirty denim piece for the summer.   it's light weight but good quality.   the only draw back is the waist is quite fitted when zipped.   had to size up.    it's like a pencil skirt on top, which does make it tough to tuck anything in unless it's very thin.   overall, charming skirt.   do love."
1,"Flexible for your needs I bought this in the green plaid for travel since i don't wear long pants of this fabric weight here in honolulu. it is styled so that you can roll the bottoms up for a more casual look, showing some ankle and wearing dress flats . would be a perfect casual work look with a navy tee. since i'm only 5'3"" and this is travel-wear, i got it in a regular rather than petite because i wanted to keep the cuffed-look but cover my ankles. i tend toward adventure travel and these held up well on a recent t"
1,Love! These jeans are excellent! i've been looking for a boyfriend jean that has plenty of room without just looking too big and these are it. there's lots of give in the material but they still conform to your shape. i highly recommend!
1,"Such a fun top! Love this top. pretty colors and don't forget to notice the black lace at the bottom. can easily be dressed up or down with jeans or cigarette black pants and heels. everyone looks good with bare shoulders, so this is a definite for my fall / winter season."
1,"Sizing off So after reading the 2 reviews, decided to just order my usual size (26), thinking they might be a tad snug. wrong! they were huge! i looked at the size to see if they sent me a size 30 by mistake! unfortunately small sizes sold out. quality is excellent as well as style, so bummed!"
1,Vibrant colors This skirt is adorable and has a beautiful pattern! it's also extremely comfortable. a total steal at the sale price!
1,"Fun multi season pant Purchased the navy/green and the red/brown. ultimately exchanged the red for the black/gold. the charlies tend to run small, so size up one. i normally wear a 26/2, but needed a 4 in these. the side zip makes for a slimming fit. i'm 5'3 and it is an ankle fit. i've paired a sleeveless silk navy blouse with the blue pant when the weather was warm and now i pair with a white oxford and navy cable knit sweater. i see many more possibilities for both pairs. fun print and fabric that can work through"
1,"Very chic This top is very gorgeous and chic. it is very tight at the bottom, but i feel like it will stretch a little over time, it is also very long which i love, because it can be rouched up to a great length if you are curvy. both colors are great, i bought both and love both. the sizing was correct, if you want it to fit like it does on the model shot. if you want it a little more fitted, size down, but it may be very tight on the bottom. all in all i love them and they are definitely a great find fo"
1,"Love, love, love As soon as my eyes touched these pants i knew my body had to. not only doo they look great, they feel great. the material is very soft with just enough stretch. they've quickly become my favorites. i loved the first pair so much i immediately bought the other color."
0,"Too much fabric, shoulders won't stay down This is a gorgeous print, but i found it too fussy for my taste.  it is quite shapeless so i tried doing a half tuck. it looked cute for about 2 seconds, but then i had to worry about keeping the shoulders down."
1,"Perfect What a great fit! it is casual, but can be dressed up. i could have done the extra small, but the small isn't too big and is still flattering."
1," The sweater is prettier in person than online. great quality, tight knit, overall good purchase. however, it does run small. i would absolutely size up. i am a size 4 with a 34 c chest and i ordered a m and i would have been happy with a roomier l. i was going to return to my local store but they were sold out in the larger sizes.
i will keep it because it's gorgeous and i'll make do with the less relaxed fit, but it doesn't look on me like it does on the model."
1,"Shapely sweater This is a lovely sweater that doesn't look much on me the way it does on the model in the picture. i actually like it better on me! it's got a good scoop neck and it gives me a shape. i tried it on in a small and i'm on the fence about whether to buy it or not. i don't really need it, but with the discount codes retailer is offering these days i feel like i should buy it anyway..."
0,"Wow...can't figure out who these are cut for? I am so bummed. these jeans are the perfect weight, totally distressed (and torn) in a way that looks like you've owned them for years, they flare out at the bottom of the legs just the right amount...but there is one huge - or i should write small - problem: your thighs have to be incredibly small to get these pulled all the way on.

i am a 27 in level 99 and ag brand jeans, and a 28 in my other pairs of coh jeans and in mih jeans as well. i do not have an hourglass figure (my shou"
0,Just ok I wanted to love this sweater but the fit is off slightly. i ordered my regular size xs and the chest/shoulder area fits nice but the waist comes very tight and not flattering to wear unless style similar to the model with a tucked in look. nice color and decent quality fabric but not my favorite fit. going back to the store.
1," This sweater looks way better in person than in this picture. the secret: try the petite size. loses a star for not having seamed edges , so it might fray or unravel easily-- but of course that clean unseamed cut looks super cute, especially around the neck. also a bit spendy. but let me say again: super cute on."
1," I purchased this sweater since the design immediately caught my eye. i love it. i am 5-03 fit and trim, but chose a large/regular to accommodate my shoulders and chest. the fit is close but i do not look ""poured"" into it. i do have a long back-waist length--not a true petite. the wool is soft, substantial; but not bulky. sleeve length is flattering. i plan to wear this sweater to the office on casual fridays with well-fitted dark-wash jeans--an appropriate look for anyone, not withstanding an ad"
1,"Didn't look great on me... It does run large as most reviewers noted. i opted for the pxs and it was still very large and the way that the elastic at the top hit me it bunched funny and made my chest look huge and i'm only a b cup. it added a good two cup sizes to my chest and it just looked odd. the length of the petite was good for me at only 5'4"" so the length did not overwhelm but the width was still really too wide. love the fabric and the lace at the hemline. it just wasn't for me but for those it works for it is be"
1,"Unique I am usually between a s/m.  bought it in the small and glad i did.  the blouse is billowy.  had some trouble at first getting the top to stay ""off the shoulder"" because it raises up when you raise your arms (obviously).  stretched out just enough and is now comfortable.  the black lace design at the bottom is different and pretty."
1,"Unique and good quality Love the way these pants fit. love the length. love the cut! just the right amount of flare... normally i am a 28 or 29 in citizens jeans. i considered the 27 in them, but the legs were a bit tight. 28 was just about perfect. and the best part....they are finally on sale. i look forward to wearing them with flats or heels and a simple white shirt!"
1,"Heavy look lightweight feel This sweater looks heavy online bit is a very thin sweater. it runs tts however if you like the short length then i'd size down. i'm 5'4, 120# 34d and the xs was perfect. the sweater didn't feel too scratchy but it's not a soft sweater. very feminine."
1," This sweater fits differently than it looks on the model in the photo. it is more fitted, less bell sleeve. and the neck is less boat-neck on me. i am often between sizes at retailer, but in this one i got the larger size and it fits well. i love this sweater. i just wanted to mention that i think it fits differently than what it looks like in the pic."
1," This dress! the picture doesn't do the dress justice. its so beautiful, well made, and unique. lots of beading and detailing for the price. i'm super happy with my purchase !"
1,Best jeans ever The jeans are soft and comfortable.  they are the perfect staple in my closet.  more colors please!
0,"Very strange design I found this skirt on the sale rack and apparently miss marked and i did not try it on. when i got home i tried it on to find it has this open flap in the front with a very short slip. the color is a dark navy. i love the brand because they claim on the label to be made in the usa, which is something i prefer. i am still on the fence about this skirt thinking maybe i would bring it to the tailor to see if the panel can be stitched to the faux leather material half way down to eliminate this full"
0,"Pricey This dress is only suitable for a beach cover-up: it is completely sheer. expensive, even on sale, for something with such a limited wearability. i returned it."
1,Great transitional top This is a perfect late summer into fall top! you can easily pair with shorts and sandals then transition to jeans/booties for the fall. it's slightly on the roomy side (i am usually a medium and i had room) but i think that's just the structure of the shirt. off the shoulder style stays perfectly in place!
1,"Cute tensile style jean skirt Adorable skirt but fit is definitely too tight like the other reviews before me 
 i am super petite 4 11 105 pounds the double zero and zero were just a little tight for me and a little too long ( both could fit around my waist which is a 24 but high waisted and tight not a fit around the hips)
 if  the length had been above the knee i might have kept  the zero but they were both returned 
 great skirt in the theory  with the wrong  waste fit and length"
0,Cute for a straight figure This looks great on the model and is probably beat suited for someone that is tall and thin with small hips.
1,"Size up! I'm curvy on the bottom, and i think this is quite flattering for curves. i'd definitely advise sizing up on this one. because it's flared, i can wear it higher up on my waist. but that's not ideal, and i think a bigger size will fit better. it's a very lightweight fabric and does wrinkle easily. the color i got was a faded denim blue. this is a lot lighter than what i'd call ""dark denim""."
1,"Can yank them down! Love the style, fabric and fit generally, but even ordering down a size, i could yank them right down. trying going down one more size, but not sure it will work as much as i want it to."
1,"Love it!! I wasn't sure how this top would look on me but i just love it! i am 5'3"", 115 lbs and i ordered the petite small. i may even been able to get away with petite xs. i did not find this top too full, long or tentlike at all. i have a bust as well and it looks very flattering on me. i wore it with denim shorts and it will look great with skinny jeans. i would also wear it on the beach as a cover up. very versatile. i love the color and pattern on the top and really love the black lace on the bottom"
0,"Better in the photo I was excited to receive this top because i love the design, but was very disappointed when it arrived. i thought the embroidery would be striking but it's not. the material is a t-shirt knit which also added to the disappointment. it was not flattering at all."
1,"Very cute I love this style. reminds me of what we used to wear back in the 70's. it's very cute, flattering, and material is a high quality. will look good with skinny or boot cut jeans. if you like this ""baby doll"" style, you'll love this."
1,Fancy pants The material is great!! got them in both colors and went with a tall size for one. everyone compliments them!
1,"Perfect! Order yourself a pair today! my new favorite jean, especially for spring/summer. good color and very comfortable."
1,"Chic and flattering For the last few seasons,bordeaux releases this top in different materials and a slight variation, but same off-the-shoulder theme (the winter merino wool version was always sold out as soon as it hit the store). this is my third top in this version. it is very flattering but it must be styled right, which an retailer stylist taught me. it must be turned to the side a bit in order to fit correctly (but not necessarily have to be pulled off-the-shoulder). the bottom hem has to be placed at the uppe"
1,"Best top ever! This may be the most beautiful top i've ever purchased from retailer!  gorgeous, classy, comfortable and one-of-a-kind!  i wish there were another pattern available so i could buy it.  runs large; buy a smaller size than you usually wear.  you will feel chic and confident in this flattering top.  i wear it on the shoulders; a perfect ""10""!"
1,Adjustable and stylish The adjustable tie is really nice and adds a nice style twist to a black suit.
1,"Gorgeous top! love that it comes in petite I saw this on a girl at the winery where i work and i thought to myself - i have to have that top! it is perfect for the fall season. the pattern/print is very intricate and lovely. i think it fits true to size - the petite xxs is just right. the sleeves do not come to the wrist, but the photo here depicts that already. the elastic in the arms feel a little tight, but that would be my own negative comment. the fabric is beautiful and flows just right - it does not feel to big to me at all. i'm s"
1,"Beautiful dress but it runs very large I love the look of this dress but it runs very large. i am 5'2 110lbs. i ordered the extra small on sale & got a killer deal on it. i intended to use it as a beach cover up since it's sheer, but when i tried it on i felt like i was wearing a mumu. even for the price & for the beach i am going to return it. i'm sad because it is a beautiful cover-up and for what it is i think the quality is good."
1,Classy I got this in the blue and love it. tts and the shape is very unique and classy- better than shown on the model. it can be worn alone or with a long sleeve underneath as a layer. considering the neutral as well.
1,Great sweater - incomplete description Lovely sweater which fits true to size. i wish i would have known it was 3/4 sleeve....
1,"Cute country tunic I just got this shirt the other day at the store.
to my surprise i needed a size zero. i usually wear a size 4 or small never that small. 
i am 5'4 and a 34dd and it was still a little loose!! i bought the blue and brown color combination.
it looked really cute on with a pair of white jeans for summer."
1,"Very boxy It was hard for me to rate how this was sized-it is tight through the bust, very baggy and boxy through the body, and short. looked gorgeous on the hanger though!"
1,"Lovely white dress for summertime Fell in love with the dress at the first sign. yes, have to confess that i always love white dresses- but this dress is not only beautiful on the picture, but also very pretty to put on. material is natural, gentle on my skin; style is simple, romantic, and it goes well with almost everything to dress up or dress down... very comfortable to wear, good for a long moon-light beach walk.
size runs large, have to get petite xxs, and it fits perfectly (normally i go with petite 2 for a fitted dress)"
1,"Beautiful cross between mensware and women's I love this top, it is a cool style mix between mensware and women's. the collar is gorgeous, making it feminine and beautiful. i normally wear a size large in retailer, i would size down. returning my large for a medium. a beautiful shirt for many occasions."
1,Flowy and romantic This dress is lovely and has a comfy fit. the green color is gorgeous. i felt the sizing was large and sent it back.
0,"Odd... So much odd stuff going on here with the cut/fit. the top is sort of tight in the bust, even with a small chest. the sleeves are dolman-style and are billowy at the top, but then tight on even my skinny arms. the slip plus the dress itself took me a good 5 minutes to figure out how to put on...just too much effort. it is otherwise a beautiful pattern, color, and length. just a miss for me personally in the fit department. bummer!"
1,"The white dress for me With all the white dresses to choose from this year, this was the one i settled on. it is comfortable, the quality is good, especially in the edge detail, it's machine washable (which is a must for me and white), and it is easy to dress up or down. i am 5'7"", 125lbs and found my usual size small to fit tts - it is loose fit like the model shot. easy throw on and go dress with cute details to boot :)"
0," I i hesitate to say that i don't recommend this dress,it really is so pretty,but a different fabric might have worked better. more importantly,the cut is not right,for me anyway. the neckline is a little high and the dress starts to flare out from the lower end of your boobs and continues all the way down giving a very wide lower half,way too much fabric at the bottom....looks like a triangle . if they' done a scoop neck and a shift style it would have been perfection"
1,"Love this dress! I bought this dress to use for maternity photos and it is perfect! i love the flow of the skirt and the elastic waistband worked perfect. i was able to fit in a size 2 (normally a size 0) so i hope to be able to wear it after pregnancy as well. i was worried about the bust area being too small, and while it's a tight fit for me currently it still worked."
1," So i typically avoid jumpsuits, rompers, etc. but there is always something that still makes me try them! and every time i'm disappointed. inevitably. which is such a bummer! so i knew this time wouldn't be any different, plus there was only an extra small available to try. which i'm definitely not an extra small, usually a medium maayyyyybe a small. but i kid you not, it fit perfectly!! it was super flattering in every way!! the material is so soft, and light weight, but still thick enough. i a"
1, I'm not sure i understand the negative reviews either. the fit for me was perfect and i saw another lady try it on with a very different body type from mine and it looked great on her. the colors are gorgeous and i am in love with the fact that it has sleeves. maybe i am of an age where i don't always want my arms showing but it is so refreshing to have some choices in retailer of dresses with sleeves. i also appreciate that the slip underneath is a great stretchy material and not the stiff polyes
1,"Not as pictured I ordered the dress online and found it to be not as pictured.  the length hit several inches above the knee.  the sleeves are also 3/4 length rather than full length as pictured.  i found the cut to be much less fitted through the torso as well.  i tried both the small and xsmall, which are my usual sizes.  the small was very loose through the torso, the xsmall was better, but looked overall too short, as if it were a petite cut.  i am 5'9"", however the model is supposed to be 5'10""."
1,"Weekend cuteness! I bought this top in the caramel brown and white. i'm blonde so the color combo is super cute. matched with a lower rise faded, worn jeans rolled and caramel leather slip on gym shoes and it makes such a cute weekend outfit. the top is very light and sheer so a camp underneath. it's a loose fit but not too much. do a little quarter tuck in the front and roll the sleeves and voila! super cuteness!
the fit was great for me as a slender but athletic build, small bust. true to size."
1,"Belle of the ball Gorgeous blush color, soft flowing material made for a perfect outdoor summer wedding guest dress. the elastic around the waist could have been slightly tighter as the dress is a bit weighted but not loose enough to deter my purchase. i'm curvy and this dress was very flattering. i'm on the shorter side and didn't buy the petite (it wasn't available in store and i bought this the day before the wedding); i had to pick up the dress to walk up steps but was fine otherwise in 2 inch heels. i receiv"
1,"So cute, honey is surprisingly classy I so wanted this top in red, and tried on the 0, but it was a little big/long on my 5'1.5"" frame #115 lbs, 30dd#, i tried ordering 0petite, but it was sold out. te only one available was the honey color, so i decided to try it, even though i am very pale... well, i actually do like it. it isn't as popping as the red, but it is super flattering, and the color is actually classy,... so i feel like i could wear this with a dressier outfit, not just casual. i love the feel, the fabric is airy, great"
1,"Love fall dresses! I ordered this dress on a whim because i love the classic look, it has long sleeves, and the color is beautiful. i can't tell if there is sparkle in person, it looks like it on pictures, or holes... but regardless, love it. i tried on both xxs p and xs p and found the xs p was more comfortable for me, for those who find clothing at retailer is being made bigger, this is more a ""classic"" size, as in what i would have ordered in the past (this summer, i had to go down in size a lot). the fabric is c"
1,"Romantic Soft and feminine, pretty pastel colors, very romantic. the fit is flattering and feminine, the fabric is light, the lining is soft. color is pale and i may need a little brighter colors, but i might let that pass... i am on the fence only based on color, otherwise, gorgeous dress. the 0 fit me well, but the back touched the ground, so i would probably order petite (front is higher, so no issue there).

1,"Love Nice light weight fabric, drapes well.  awesome detailing.  have worn twice already with lots of compliments."
1,"Love the color! I ordered this top in small petite but wished i had exchanged it for an xsp because it's wide in the arm holes. but i love it nonetheless and wear it with a cami underneath. i love that while it's sleeveless, the straps are wide. this type of wide top is not for well endowed women up top. i don't have that problem so it looks really cute. i also love the length. a lot of tops tend to be really long and for a petite person, shorter tops look best."
1,"Great top This is a great casual top. it is true to size and a light weight cotton blend. i am an xxsp which fits me perfectly and the tan and white looks crisp and clean. i keep finding myself choosing this top to wear with jeans, cut offs and white shorts. i am frequently chilly, even in the summer and like the long sleeve which i can roll up or keep down. i wish i bought the other two colors before they sold out in my size."
1,"Gorgeous dress! I don't understand the negative reviews on this dress. i absolutely love the fit, may be the prior reviewer was trying a size on that was too large? yes, the fabric and the snaps are very delicate so you have to be careful putting it on and off, but the fit is very flattering on most people. i saw three different people trying it on in the fitting room today so i decided to try it on myself and had to have it! the colors are beautiful and the uneven hem makes it more fun and young. i will wear i"

1,"Beautiful and artistic Loved this dress. it does run a little long even with 3"" high heels. i am5 '3"", and probably would have been
better with a petite size. often i do not like the proportions with petite so i ordered the regular size. i feel very feminine in this dress and love the opening at the side. i can walk in it if i hold the skirt up in front a tiny bit. not sure if i will hem it. the print is pretty; however, busy. i will keep this dress as it does make one look slim and romantic. i added an black belt, w"
1,Love at first sight! This top is so good i bought every. single. color. i sized up for more flow but it does run true to size. this is that sweet little summer top that we all long for!
1,"Beautiful, versatile little white dress! This dress is beautiful on! it is flowy and loose but is cut well so it avoids looking like a tent. white dresses with lace can run the risk of being a bit fussy-- the lace at the bottom is a beautiful detail without being too precious and the handkerchief bottom keeps it interesting. can be styled so many ways-- looks great with a cropped denim jacket, belted, or loose with a long necklace. also tried with a sleeveless long sweater vest and it was adorable. the dress is fully lined and feels su"
0,"Sleeve I've been looking for a nice summer maxi dress and after reading some positive reviews, i decided to get the dress. the fabric is soft and has a nice flow to it. however, i had to return the dress because the cuff of the sleeve was too tight on my forearm, which make it impossible for me to raise my arms.

i ordered size petite xxs"
1,"Cute top, flatters large bust I was a little wary of this top but decided to try anyway. so glad i did. the style is great and the fabric is lightweight and comfy. i debated between the blue and the honey and ended up with the honey. it is just so different yet such a nice neutral. i am normally a size 10 (or maybe a large 8) in tops and purchased this in size 6. it definitely runs large. for reference i am 5'6"", 145 lbs, 34dd. not sure why another reviewer said this top isn't for large busts. it was very flattering on me an"
1,"Great shirt This shirt is a great deal on sale,i would not pay full price.i got it in the honey color and it is really cute. this shirt does run very large. i normally wear a small or size 4 to 6 and i was lost in a size 6. i went with a size 2 and it was perfect for sizing purposes i am a 34c and 5'3"" 112lbs..shirt is a bit lightweight so it is nice for summer or year round."
1,"Flattering and feminine Love everything about this dress except for the elastic waistband. it's a dressier style, and the elastic cheapens the look--definitely needs a ribbon or belt to cover. otherwise the cut and fit is very flattering, the fabric is nice, and the floral pattern is lovely. i found the dress tts (size 4r and i'm 5'4"", 120 lbs)."
0,"Big disappointment! I loved the print and fabric of this dress when i first saw it, but trying it on was a very different story! the photo seems to show a wider, more well-defined waist, with just a small amount of ""blousing"" on top, but this was not the case. yes, the waist fit, but it is a narrow band that was covered completely by the hanging over of the ill-fitting top, turning the entire look into a shapeless and very unattractive fit. sadly, this is going right back!"
1,"Liked it, but impractical Nice fabric and construction. the small fit me, a usual size 6. only problem: there is no way to easily use the bathroom in this thing! seriously. that's why i'm returning it."
1," The fabric has a smooth feel, and the shape is perfect over skinny jeans. i like the yoked v neckline, a different take on the usual buttons of a popover. i wear a white cami under it from retailer to bring up the depth just a little. great with blue jeans, white jeans, and shorts. i bought this shirt in red, size 2. i'm 5'6"", 125 lbs."
1," Super cute, great for a casual summer day. fabric is nice and light and honey color goes well with denim, kaki  or olive green. runs a little large but still looks good especially with fitted jeans or capri pants."
1,"Beautiful! I bought this dress last week for a wedding next summer. it did not appeal to me on the hanger, but once i tried it on, i was so impressed. the green color is lovely and it is lightweight and airy, and it does have a lining which is a plus. i love the little ruffle sleeves and the tie in the back is perfect. there have been comments about the hemline being awkward but the length on me was perfect and has just the right amount of flounce to be feminine. i can't wait to wear this dress! (i am 5'6"""
1,"Comfy, but not flattering to larger busts I really liked this top-- the red gingham is adorable, and it looked great tucked into the pencil skirt i was also trying on. sadly, it had two things going against it:
- when i didn't tuck it in, it looked like i was hiding an early pregnancy (it just hangs from the chest, and my bust is relatively large-- 34dd)
- the material is awfully thin, and i don't know how it would hold up (that's a concern when you're spending $90 on a ""casual"" top)
i would certainly consider purchasing this on sale"
1,"Love this casual top This is the perfect summer top! lightweight and breezy. looks great either tucked in to jeans or shorts or worn loose. loved the blue one, so i came back to get the red one. (i would recommend buying one size smaller than usual.)"
1,"Perfectly elegant I saw this dress but was hesitant to purchase it online because of the reviews. i went to the absolutely fabulous new walnut creek store and though it wasn't on the floor they found one in my size in the storeroom.
i tried it on and was immediately enthralled. i am 5'10 and the dress flowed like a dream. i will be wearing it for my anniversary celebration with pearls and victorian earrings. i can't wait. it is lovely. you may need to be a little taller than average to wear this but it is wonder"
1," I originally bought the tan at the store. i loved it so much and ordered the red, but went down a size as it does run big. perfect for the summer."
1,Cute I saw this top in store and immediately picked up the red one. i am usually a 6 in tops sometimes an 8 but ended up with a 4.  feels a little snug in the armpit area but doesn't look it. i ended up getting the honey color one which looks great with white and army green pants. i loved the red one but felt like i was wearing a picnic blanket. it is a little flimsy and probably won't last that long so if you want to wait for it to go on sale and hope they have your size i would do that.
1,"Super cute & comfy top! When i saw this top online i loved it, and in person i love it even more! so perfect for spring/summer and i can see it even transitioning into fall. the sizing is perfect - i am a size 12/l in tops, and the size 12 i ordered is just right. it's loose but not too loose or frumpy looking. the fabric is slightly thin but that's perfect for the summer, but it would be cute layered with a cami or a cardigan when it's cooler. the only thing is, if you a little busty, the neckline might dip a tiny bit"
1,"Beautiful statement dress I must disagree with some of the other reviews! when i first saw this dress online, i loved it and couldn't wait to try it on. i didn't order it online because i read some of the other reviews and so i wanted to try it on in the store before i bought it because i was nervous the fit wasn't going to be good. they were so wrong! maybe it just takes a certain body type. i have an hourglass figure, and i'm 5'8"" tall, i tried on a size 10, and it fit beautifully! the waist is very form fitting, and t"
1,"Not for me I love the pattern and style of the dress, but unfortunately, it's doesn't fit quite right. the top is too loose (the clip doesn't work well) and the waist line of the dress sit above the waist. and the sleeves are tight (which is shocking to me because i have skinny arms)."
1,"Gorgeous dress The dress is absolutely beautiful. the fabric is light, the pattern is not overwhelming and has a zipper on the side to make it more fitted in the waist. the top is blousy, but i am only a c cup and it still was perfect. the bottom has an uneven cut that makes the dress very interesting. i love it. i am usually a size 2 or 4 and the size 4 was perfect."
1,"Cute top I bought this top in the brown /white combo although i really wanted the red /white but haven't had any luck finding it. i am never sure of my size in retailer but run anywhere from small to large depending on brands. i'm 5'4"", 140, 34 ddd. i wish other reviewers would state their sizes to help others purchase.. i got this shirt in size 8 which usually never happens to me. i wear a white tank or cream cami underneath since it is very sheer and dips low at the cleavage area. it is still flowy but n"
1," Once i tried this dress on i understood why the pricepoint was so high! it's very thick ( but not uncomfortable) and very well made. love the color and style of this dress, but as others have said, the model picture is deceiving. try it on in store to see if you like it for yourself! i'm curvy on top and bottom with broad shoulders and personally it was a no for me, i found other dresses that i loved more, this one was pretty but wasn't a hit for me."
1,"Perfection The fabric and color is stunning. very well made. i'm 5'8"" and this romper works fine. it is long enough in the body. true to size. love it!"
1,Too much fabric Love the colors and top part but it runs extremely large and there is way too much fabric it is almost like a moo moo. had to return
0,"Too short The dress is not like pictured. it is above the knee and sleeves are neither 3/4 nor full length-somewhere in between. i am 5'4, 112 lbs, bought xs regular. had higher expectations for the price. going back to the store."
1,Beautiful! This dress is amazing! i have to say when i picked it up to try it on i thought it would just be an ok dress but i thought might as well try it on. to my surprise it was more than perfect! the waste cinches in when it is zip it up and the blousing in the chest fits lovely.
1,"Simply beautiful I had been eying this dress online for a while and when it finally came into stores i was so excited! this dress is so gorgeous and very flattering on my body. i love the bottom of it, it is more of a u cut in the front and square in the back. add an ada wrap belt and perfection!"
1,"I like this dress! I bought the xs and the fit was good. i'll probably add a snap at the bust area because the slip underneath does show like a camisole, which is fine, but i prefer it closed. also i'll add a belt to cinch my waist, booties and maybe a hat."
1,"Wonky fitted top I love the material & flow of the bottom half of this dress, it fits like a charm.  for reference i am a 34-29-38/39, the size 6 was spot on. that being said, i was a little disappointed by the top portion of the dress; the dolman sleeve seems odd & the faux wrap is gaping & doesn't seem to clip in the right spot, sloppy, not like on the model. the dress would be perfect as a full sleeve & a little snugger of a wrap. i could alter the top, but the material just wouldn't lay right to the waist."
1,"Love it but have to return I love this dress but i will return it because the sleeves are too tight. i have never had this problem before. i ordered a petite 0 and petite 2. for reference i am 5' 4"" tall and 117 lbs. the length is perfect and i really like the style. if the sleeves had not been so tight i would have kept the petite 0. the petite 2 sleeves were no looser. sorry that this did not work for me."
1,Love this dress! I love this dress! it is so comfortable. the material feels nice and the print is beautiful. the only reason i didn't give this a 5 overall rating is because this fits a little big. i bought a petite medium and the elastic around the top is not as tight as i'd like. it still fits and stays on but it would feel a little better if it was a little more snug at the top. i love this dress because it is casual enough to walk around in but still feels somewhat dressy. i will probably take this dress wi
1,"New summer staple This is so pretty for summer. it is very lightweight and flattering on. the color was a little brighter than i expected, but it is still beautiful!"
1,"Perfect Being 5 ft, long/maxi dresses are usually not what i buy, but i tried this dress on and it was the perfect length for me. i wear size 2 or 4 and i tried on both sizes in store. the 4 i tried on had a shorter length for some reason than the 2 (maybe it was a petite and was mislabeled?). i ended up getting the 4 and i love the dress!"
1,"Love!!! Gorgeous dress! love that it's flowy, soft, and fits very well. it does run a size smaller. i usually wear a 4 and went with a 2p one this one. the sleeves are a bit tighter on the petite than the regular in the same size."
1,"Versatile & beautiful Living in a warm climate, i'm always on the hunt for great spring/summer dresses that can be worn to work, dinner, or just general out and about.
this dress is a great length with the varied hemline that gives you enough length for work or dinner. it's also great for a summer cocktail party or afternoon out shopping. i'm a traditional hourglass figure, larger on top and bottom with a small waist, dress size 6 or 8 depending on the top. i roared this in a medium and it's perfectly comfy and hang"
1,"Sweet, pretty and romantic I tried this dress on on a whim and will definitely be getting it! the fit was perfect as it is not to structured so its really a more relaxed piece even though it doesnt look it... but the way you feel when you wear it is just magical!! i love this dress!!!"
0,"Gorgeous, but... Everything about this dress is beautiful except for the hemline. the color is beautiful; the old-fashioned, wispy femininity is beautiful. the dress probably could use something better at the waistline besides elastic, maybe ribbons to tie, but the hemline is what kills it. it is half a normal-length dress (in the front) and half maxi dress (in the back). the designer should have chosen one or the other, not both, and it would have been much better. for the category of aesthetic/design, i would"
1, I like this top very much. i love the color and the embroidery makes it very dressy. it fits right for me however the picture doesn't show it well but there's a bit too much fabric on the sides.
1,"Super cute but runs very large I absolutely loved this once i got it out of the package. it's a very vibrant print in the red print, almost a picnic vibe, and the material feels soft and high quality. it runs very large though, i usually take an 8 or maybe a 6, and am busty, and in this i am pretty sure i will need the 4. i almost convinced myself i had lost weight when i tried it on! but i will return the 8 and get the 4 in the red, as well as probably at least one of the other colors as i like it so much."
1,"Romantic Soft florals on light as air chiffon layers--what's not to like on this romantic dress?  i appreciate the elastic waist and the tie at the back of the neck, as it gives me flexibility during my weight fluctuations.  my only regret is that i'm too darn short for regular length and will have to wear platforms since the back of the hem drags on my 5'3"" self.  purchased the size 8 and i am 140# 36dd."
1, Charming dress! fit perfectly with great movement through back and chest area. flattering length(s) with just the right amount of fabric. inside dress sheath or slip dress. zips to waist for fit. i am smitten with the dress - just love it!
1,Recommend on sale This top is cute. i purchased a 2 instead of my usual size 4 and it fits well. i only recommend buying this top on sale. it is not good quality! there are loose threads hanging out of the seams all over the place and it is see through. it is totally nuts that it costs $88.
1,"Floral & fab! This is the perfect dress! for it being a long maxi, it's surprisingly lightweight. the built in slip it covers everywhere you need it to without detracting from the overall look of the dress. i absolutely love it and wish it came in other colors/patterns."
0,"Color is off, middle too wide. I so wanted to love this top. i ordered the ""blue"", which is blue and orange. i thought the orange would be brighter, it is not. it is a dull color. also, i'm usually a medium, this top fits fine on my shoulders/bust 34c, but it was huge around the waist, making me look a lot larger. if this top were a bit smaller around the waist, i would keep it, but it is going back."
0,"Too much material at the bottom Unfortunately, this dress did not work for me like the other reviews. i am 5'8, 130lbs, and the dress looked like a tent on me (size s). there was just way too much material at the bottom. also, while the dress is lined, both layers are quite thin- not see through, but i would not call them substantial either. for the cost of the dress and the material, it wasn't worth paying more to have it tailored to fit better."
0,"Tight in all the wrong places... The model looks awesome in this cute top, but on me it looked boxy but was too tight around the chest and was too short (for reference, i'm 5'7,"" 140 lbs., and 34c). the front is non-stretchy eyelet lace cotton fabric, yet the back is stretchy. in theory, it's pretty, but in reality it doesn't work - at least for me. i think it might work for someone petite with a smaller chest."
1,"Better in person.... I would never have bought this top from the online photo but happily came across in in my local store. i bought it in the hot pink gingham check and it is so cute and fresh. will work well for hot summer days when i may want to wear rolled up sleeves as it is very lightweight and gauzy. i bought my usual xs/0, (5'7"", 32b, 115lbs), and whilst it is looser on me than the model, i would still say that it is tts - maybe a little fuller in the back than i would like, but i will wear mine partially tu"
1,Beautiful I love this dress so much. absolutely beautiful true to the size. since i start wearing it i got so many good compliment. the flowers is very spring and summary. very sexy to the bottom....
1,"Proper plaid This top is girl-next-door sweet. i'm mad about plaid so it was love at first sight for me! i love a blouse with a touch of spandex because i like the fitted look but not tight or loose, and spandex gives a bit of a yield. size 4 regular fits me well (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), the hem falls at mid hip and the sleeves fall about 1/4"" pass my wrist (i plan to wear this top tucked in and the sleeves rolled up since the weather is warmer now). the color honey is versatile, blue motif has a"
1," This is the best little romper i have ever tried on. i don't typically love myself in shorts but these are so flowing and the pattern is so pretty i couldn't resist. the material is nice and the length is great. i'm 5'6"" and 135lbs and the small fit great."
1,Not for this jumpsuit girl I typically do well with jumpsuits but this one did not work. i am smaller on top than the bottom but not by much. i got the xs and it was tight in the calves and short in the waist but the top fit perfectly. maybe a s would have fit better but i got it on sale and s was out of stock. it defiantly did not look like it does on the model. :) i am typically a size 2. the material is really nice. i was hoping for a jumpsuit that could be casual an covered since most jumpsuits tend to show more skin
1,"Please, post accurate measurements I'm 5'4'', between sizes 12 and 14. i ordered a size petite large, and it's a bit loose, which is acceptable, but i'd like to try a regular size medium to see if it'd be more fitted like i see in the model.
my problem is with the length. i read the description and it says petite = 40.5'' of length. the large petite i ordered is above my knees, this is not 40'' of length by any means, it's 36.5''.
i'd really appreciate if the size info was correctly available."
1,"Easy, springy blouse This is a great long sleeve, casual shirt for spring - soft and airy. pairs well with jeans. i found that it fit me just right. i'm not very tall, but my shoulders are a little broad for my height, which typically puts me in the ""small/medium"" range, so i got size 6 regular. this hits just below the hip and the shoulders are spot on. very flattering yolk that gives a little contour to the bust. gauzy fabric has wrinkled texture which gives it a casual look and feel. my only problem is there aren"
1,"My new go-to spring dress I... love... this dress. the fit is incredibly flattering (and i'm currently carrying more weight than my normal size). i selected a 6, which is about a size larger than normal, and it was a perfect fit. i tried on a larger size for measure, and the 6 provided a (perfect) fit and flare. i've worn the dress on three occasions, already, and each time friends remarked on their admiration for the dress, itself and flattering style for me, i have no issues, at all, with the cut, and to me, the bias a"
1,Light weight and comfortable This top is very light weight and comfortable. i am normally a 8/10 in tops due to my bust size but ordered a 6 based on other reviews. it fits great. i really like the fit and the pattern. it has been a great summer shirt and i can see myself grabbing for it in the fall paired with skinny jeans and a cute bootie.
1,"Love it! This is a precious! it's a little thin, as i prefer a thicker fabric. however, wearing a tank top under it works perfectly. i have it now in both colors! great price on sale!"
1,Fab shirt I got this shirt in red plaid and love it. super cute without being too trendy. i wore it with shorts and got lots of compliments.
1,"Flowing and flattering I originally purchased this dress in a petite 6. i am 5'3"", 125lbs with a 36"" bust. the petite 6 was a bit too tight so i returned it and went up to a size 8. so happy i did! this dress drapes and flows beautifully and i find it immensely flattering to my hourglass figure. i also adore the floral print! one reviewer objected to the way the bodice drapes and the very small hook closure which seemed insufficient. i did not object to this characteristic. it fit me beautifully throughout the bodice/"
1,"Super cute summer top This is not usually a top that i am attracted to, but it is so cute paired with jeans and sandals. nice, light-weight top for summer."
0,"Very big, scratchy I'm petite, and i knew buying this that it would be a big sweater - that is the look that is portrayed on the model. the sweater is scratchy, the neck was so big and bulky i had trouble making it lay right. it looks great on the model here, but not on me. going back. so bummed. the color gray is true to what is shown and it has little ""holes"" or openings across the shoulders. so there is a tiny bit of detail. overall, not a great sweater."
0,"Disappointed I was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for spring/summer. for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses. the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all. the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown. this dress has no shape to it, although probably comfortable, not flattering. i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture, in person."
1,"Pretty This dress is very flattering, comfortable and made me feel pretty!"
1, I love this dress but it definitely runs big. i bought a size small and i'm between a 4 and a 6 and will have to return for an xs. the top feels like it will fall down and i'm a size 34c
1,Perfection So soft!! such beautiful fabric!! it flows so gracefully and looks lovely with black leggings as pictured. one of my favorite retailer purchases to date...
0," This skirt runs small because of the stitching around the hips. the waist fit fine but the hips were very snug, and i'm relatively slim in the hips."
1,"Cozy sweater but runs large I bought this sweater because i love twinkle's knitting patterns and yarns. this sweater doesn't disappoint. i love all of the great details like the detachable collar, the double buttons along the front and the back panel is in a seed stitch (which differs from the front and sleeve stitch). it's super warm and cozy but it's also very heavy. depending on the temp outside, i can wear this as a coat. but i think the sweater will stretch over time because it's so heavy."
1, Love the look! it's a little tight but i still like it.
1," I love the detail on this shirt!  it is sheer, but looks great with a cami.  great unique piece ."
1,Pricey for what it is The front and back materials differ. the back of the shirt is soft and thin. the front embroidery is stiff but i imagine it will soften after a wash. pretty shirt though.
1,"Beautiful, unique piece Love it! i am 125# and usually a size 2-4 or 26-27 in bottoms. typically size up for holding horses. based on other reviews, i ordered this in a 2. it stretched just a bit after wearing all day, so i'm glad i didn't get my normal 4. the fit is great, quality is great. it dresses up for a casual office day, wearing well with boots and tights, and i imagine pairing with tshirt and flip flops over the summer. i unique piece that quickly became a favorite."
1,"Great swing dress ... but not for me On the hanger, this looks like a great dress .. especially to wear to a hawaii wedding. on me, not quite. 

the bell shape of this dress made it appear that i was carrying extra weight in the middle ... and the shorter length accentuated my big calves. 

for reference, i tried a 00p and i'm 5'1"", 102#, and 34a."
1,Get it quick! Can i tell you this top is amazing?! get it quick before it sells out!!
1,"Very pretty but sheer I wanted to love this top but found it to run small and was too sheer for my taste. it is a beautiful top though, but you will need a cami with it."
1,So cute! This skirt is so cute. this is a staple to have in your wardrobe. i wear it with boots and boot socks. but tights for cold winter days as well as flip flops in the summer. i got my true size of 4. its fits perfectly. i love the length with a peek of leg when you walk!
1,"Pretty top The only reason i gave this top a 4 star, is that it didn't have enough room around the bust area. i'm a d cup, and the front didn't button properly. but for the price i paid (40% off sale price), i have no coplaints.
i would recommend."
1,"Perfect tunic!! Love, love this tunic. my size 4 fits perfectly with a little room, material is very soft and very comfortable. could be worn with leggings or with a belt as a dress...so many options. so worth it!!!"
1,"Beautiful sheer top with weird hem I'm undecided about this shirt. this design is absolutely beautiful. but the shirt is very very sheer and the front comes down so low in a curved hem line. so, when you wear the necessary base layer, the shirt extends several inches beyond that and it looks kind of odd. i really wish tiny would make some beautiful shirts like this that aren't sheer and have a shorter front. i purchased my regular size and it fits a little smaller than other tiny shirts i have purchased. since the shirt is so bea"
1,"Another great tiny top. This top is similar to other tiny tops that i have ordered in the past...beautiful embroidery, great neutral and metallic color pallet that goes with everything, and light weight. the top does run small, so i needed the large size to accommodate my 38in bust plus a thin cami (shirt is see through). the large fit similarly to the fit on the model."
0,Extremely sheer! Before i ordered this i noted the other reviews that said it was sheer but thought i would just wear a layer underneath. unfortunately it was one of the sheerest fabrics i've ever seen. would love it if it could have been a more substantial fabric. to me it wasn't worth the money even on sale.
1, A great long line bra! beautiful and well made however it's tough to get the fit perfectly right. i usually wear a 32 b or 34 a and am 115lbs. the small was the best fit as the 32 (xs) was a very small 32. i could almost say it more of a 30 if that's even a size. it also rubs my skin few places so definitely not meant to be worn for more than a few hours. otherwise i recommend it!
1,Love love love...just really sheer Absolutely love this shirt - the embroidery on the front is beautiful. gold and silver metallic thread with good quality. very slim fit through the torso with loose sleeves. the only downside is the cream material is very sheer - definitely have to wear a tank underneath.
0,"Sheer shirt What drew me to this shirt was the beautiful silver and gold embroidery on the front. the shirt was folded at the store, which makes sense because if it were hung it up, fewer people would try it on. this shirt is sheer from the front and more sheer in the back. this is what bugs me about so many ""clothes"" that are made these days: they are so cheaply made, so thin with cloth, that you are forced to layer with a camisole or something else in order to wear it in public. i can't wear sheer clothes"
1,"Beautiful !!! I must say that at first i had mixed feelings about this sweater. i was actually going to return it because i was unsure about the style and color. the color is to me like a lavender mauv-ish color but the description is actually ""natural"" . i must admit that in some light it looks more brown then lavender . regardless i think that in itself tells you that this sweater is not like any other. i actually wear it as a coat and its become an essential part of my wardrobe. i found the size to be true"
1,"Beautiful, slim fit top This shirt is stunning- definitely a shirt for special occasions. it's more than i would normally pay for a top, but it is a really special piece of clothing. the fit is slim- i'm 5'6"" and 118 pounds. i typically wear an xxs or xs in retailer clothes. the xxs is just right. it is quite sheer, so i imagine i will wear a nude tank top underneath."
1,Lovely top This top looks fantastic on. definitly great when you want to look a little more dressed up! the fabric is a bit sheer so i will wear a nude camisole underneath. the design has the perfect amount of shimmer to make it dressy. it is so silky and feels great on! the neckline has the perfect plunge too.
1,"Gorgeous After reading the other reviews, i felt compelled to write one for this top. it is not often that i get to shop at an retailer store, but a few weeks ago, i had the pleasure. i saw this top, and while it was not on sale, i had to have it. yes, it is sheer and so you do need a camisole under it. the gold and silver embroidery is gorgeous. to be honest, this is my favorite top in my closet right now. i can dress it up or make it more casual. and, now that it's on sale, don't hesitate in this purchas"
1,"Okay Overall, i was pleased with this dress. i didn't love how the front wrap transitioned to the back. it is comfortable and versatile... it can be dressed up or down."
1,"Surprisingly awesome The online pictures do not do this dress justice. the materials between the top and skirt are different with the black part being a soft, sweater feel and the bottom part being an appropriately thick knit feel. the contract is stunning and is largely washed out in the online pictures. this is not the kind of dress you see on a rack and think ""oh my gosh, that's the one!"" but if you try it on, you will have this moment. it is comfortable, flattering, and slimming-a prefect everyday dress."
1,Even cuter than picture shows Lots of seam and stitching details make this even cuter than the picture's initial impression. fabric drapes nicely. the sleeves are a little tight if wearing something long-sleeved underneath. overall very unique!
1, Love the pattern. the pants are really cute! perfect for pajamas or casual outfit to go to a fiends house in. they do have a funny seam above the knee but i still find them comfortable
0,"Short; more of an empire waist than photo shows I'm 5'6"" and it hits me at mid-thigh. the top (black/camel version) is sheer enough to need a cami. the waist is quite high. not flattering for me--the empire waist makes me look a bit pregnant--plus i don't want to deal with having to wear a cami."
0,"Not typical of retailer quality This dress is so cute in the photo and fit true to size, but the material is slinky and felt cheap. the stitching was also poor quality. i am so thankful that retailer will let us order a batch, try on and return in store...this went back."
1,"Just right I feel like snagging a pair of these was the equivalent to standing in line for black friday, as they always seem to be out of stock. now i know why. these are soft, comfortable, and slimming. they're somewhere between the hold of control top pantyhose and spans--they don't fall and sag throughout the day and are nicely slimming without being pain-inducing."
1,Lovely chemise fabric! Love this print and fabric! its soft and comfy with adjustable straps. so pretty and feminine!
1,"Better in person I tried on this dress in the store and was pleasantly surprised with the fit and the look. it looks way better in person than in the pictures. the picture really doesn't do it justice. i consider myself a ""slight"" hour glass figured girl and this dress at the top hit me just right so that the crosswrap looks like it was made for my body and the peephole/keyhole in the front (you can hardly see on the model photo) is visible. i'm so happy with this dress!!! i feel like i could wear it at work/chu"
1,"Sweet surprise Don't know why but i didn't have high expectations for this dress. turns out it's uber flattering! makes my waist look tiny, accentuated bust. perfect for those of us with straight figures looking for a little more curves. bottom half of dress has heavy silky linking. top half unlined and a bit thin. color is almost pearl -- very very light gray. i'm between xs/s (33b-26-36, 5'8"" 120lb) and went with a small. hits an inch above knees. sleeves slightly loose through upper arm which is always bett"
1,"Flattering dress Love this dress, very flattering fit and the fabric does not feel heavy but is sturdy - i wore it for first dinner out with my husband after losing most of my baby weight and felt great and confident in it."
1,"Practical and pretty Love this cardigan as a wardrobe staple to quickly throw on, especially over dresses (but also anything). it drapes beautifully, and i love the button closure detail. it is definitely a thin, soft, light-weight knit, but i think that makes it practical for year-round use, much like other items by bordeaux."
1,"Bordeaux for the win As per usual bordeaux is perfect with this cardigan. very soft, washes well. love it."
1,"Great lightweight jacket I love this jacket so much, i bought two. it goes with almost everything and is a nice weight for almost any weather. i recommend you grab it while it's on sale."
1,Perfect summer tee This tee is amazing. it's light weight and perfect for the summer heat. the detail of the cross and tie back is perfect to elevate the style. this is going to be a solid staple in my tee collection. i wish it came in other colors because i would buy them all.
0,Fit weird I really wanted to like this dress and was encouraged by the positive reviews. the dress itself was very comfortable but was very unflattering. the top fabric hit my ribs funny and made me look really wide.
1,"Soft and warm I like the contrast of the skirt with the bodice, the length of the sleeves, adn the subtle cut out at the neck. the cut is very flattering, adn i am glad the daker color is at the top, hte bottome color would wash me out. i tried on the regular size nad i would not get a peitte in this as the size was the perfect length for me. petite would be too short for my liking. (regular hit just above the knee)"
0,"Not for me I tried these on because the color is really pretty and fun, and who donse't want a pair of comfy/cute pants... but they looked awful on my muscular thighs... i don't think the cut will be falttering on 99% of the population. also, not as comfortable as they looked, the crotch seemed a little ""low"" on me, though the pants were in the correct size."
0, I wanted to love this jacket. so soft and great color. unfortunately it is just too light weight. it is almost like shirt fabric. nice heft to the fabric though. nice length - accept the sleeves were short on me. i am 5'10 and 135lbs. the small was the right size. i was looking for something slightly warmer to layer.
1,"Classic and sophisticated I recently purchased this dress at my local retailer when it was 40 percent on sale. i was overwhelmed with how much i liked it. it's comfortable, elegant and very chic. 

i will make this my go-to dress from now on."
1,"Full skirt I ordered this skirt hoping i could wear it to work as it looked tailored on the model. this skirt is made from a heavy material but flares out. it is a whole lot of skirt! i'm 5'2"" and short waisted it looked like i was getting swallowed up.  i love the colors and design but it just overwhelmed me. it would work on someone taller."
1," I am 5' 2"" about 118 lbs. thought this fit really well. very comfortable material. i wish the skirt was a different color-feels a little bland."
1,Not exactly what i expected The fabric is very thick and textured almost like upholstery and has no give to it.  the zipper is a little tricky to get all the way up because of the fabric thickness. i looks cute and holds its shape. it may run a touch small because of the fabric. the colors are great though and i really like it.
1,"Cute dress This is a very cute dress that i did not keep. mainly because i did not like the neckline on me. if it had been different i probably would have kept it. i liked the fabric, the top is a little thin, but i did not think it was sheer. the bottom part is sheer, but there is a lining. it drapes beautifully. it is a little like a maternity dress, but not enough to dissuade me."
1,"Flattering and lovely sweater dress I have been on a search for a dress with sleeves that cute enough for date night. as a bigger girl than most retailer reviewers, i was happy to find this covered my ample chest and between the crosswrap and a little flare in the skirt it camoflauges my belly. it is a sweater dress, which is not easily noticable in the web photos, and can certainly be dressed up for a dinner or for the office."
1,"Adorable These pants are soft, fun print and comfy. they are a drop crotch, but the cut is flattering without bunching up between legs. they are perfect for pjs all day type day!"
1, This is my new favorite sweater. it is lightweight and drapey. very flattering. can be dressy or casual.
1,Perfect except slip This is my new favorite dress! my only complaint is the slip is too small and the dress cannot be worn without it. i can't order a size up as the dress would then be huge. not sure what the solution is but the dress itself is stunning.
0,"Such high hopes! I purchased this for a very good price and i typically love maeve... should have been a win-win. the fabric is thin and slinky in the most unfortunate way. it made finding appropriate undergarments very difficult. i had to add a slip (that helped) and figured that since i'm losing weight, it would look better when i'm down a few more pounds. that being said, i didn't find it to be figure flattering. i have a tummy and there was at least one photo from the bridal shower i wore this to, where i lo"
1,"Comfortable but not super-flattering on me I tried these on at the store and the fit was good, the length was even ok for me as a petite person. the fabric was substantial and mostly cotton, which i like. but i felt like the floral pattern drew too much attention to my thighs, so it wasn't ultimately something i felt i would wear. still a nice comfort piece if you are ok with a floral pattern on your lower half."
1,Its okay The pattern of this skirt is adorable and looks better in person but the fabric isnt the best. it feels like an elastic fabric and is way to volumous. overall not my favorite.
1,"Comfy pants These pants overall are very comfortable, but have an unusual fit. they tend to run a bit short, and i always have to get pants hemmed shorter, so if you have long legs or like more draping, you probably won't like these. they also ran a bit large in the waist and thigh, a bit puffy, i had to size down in order to get a good fit. very good quality, and cute design."
1,Compliments I wore this dress to work the other day and got so many compliments on the fit and the design - the wrap on the top. i got it in grey and it's a beautiful color for winter. the dress is very comfortable to wear.
1,Falls nicely I bought this dress for work and post work happy hours. love it! it's material is high quality and is flattering since it falls nicely on my postpartum figure. it's a little shorter than i thought but still appropriate for work.
1,"Cute and comfy This dress has a great design and fits very well and looks great. although the material is not cheap it is very warm and doesn't breath very well which is good in the winter. the only complaint i have is there was a small snag in it, but i was able to fix it my self."
1,"Super flattering! I worry when i have an elastic waist, or something that resembles this, but the dress hangs like a dream.
no puffing out, no gathers that you can see.
it is not sheath, but not a line either, kind of in between, hits several inches above my knees, but perfect with some black tights for winter. i saw the note about grey, have to try it on agin in daylight, but i would say think black on the top, light camel color on the bottom
i am 5'8, typically wear a size 12, and it was true to size for me

1,"Sweet stripes I love this little chemise! the adjustable straps sold me because i'm petite. i generally wear a small/27p. i'm about 5'1"", 124 lbs. i purchased a small and it fit perfect! the fabric is nice, not too thin or too thick. i would totally wear it just as easily as a nightgown or beach coverup. i've never been able to wear scrappy dresses, but it could probably pass for one of those too. it's flattering and pretty without being too ""pretty"", if you get my meaning."
1,"Comfy and cute My size was not available so based on reviews stating the bagginess of a certain area, i sized down and glad i did. i never size down because i do not like tight clothing, especially casual wear. nice muted print and good quality terry material. recommend, but size down if you want a more fitted feel."
1,"Awkward fit for me Love the way these pants look in the pictures, great quality, but the style isn't really me. i gave it a try, so that's what counts!"
1,"Perfectly drapey I saw the shirt on the retailer website and new i had to have it. when it arrived, it was perfectly draped, light and airy, and incredibly soft and comfortable.  it's perfect to throw on with yoga pants for errands or dress up a bit a casual night out with friends. would buy this again in several different colors if they were offered. 9/10."
1,"Perfect dress Great quality and extremely flattering. bonus that it is on sale. i felt like this dress was a godsend. i am five months pregnant and needed a dress that made me feel comfortable but not frumpy. i think i'll get a lot of mileage out of it, as there's enough stretch to get me through the next few months and then (hopefully!) i can wear it after too. also can be dressed up or down, so appropriate for many occasions. i believe it runs true to size (i sized up, from xs to s, for obvious reasons, but"
1,"Much better in person! Yes, this is a great dress! i wasn't sure about it online because of the color combination. i think i would have preferred the gray color but it was sold out. it received very good reviews online so i thought it was worth the risk at the sale price. i am always on the hunt for great dresses at great prices (who isn't?!). once i received it and tried it on, oh wow! i love it. it is so flattering. it is a very pretty dress. i think i will wear this all the time. i am actually thinking of all the d"
1,Cute dress Cute dress but not for me.  the waist is too high and the sleeves are tight.  maybe on a different body type this dress would be perfect.  i returned it.
1,Cheeky! These bottoms are very cute but defiantly cheeky! i would recommend sizing up if you want to have more coverage.
1,"Entrancing I'm so impressed with the beautiful color combinations and embroidery but disappointed in the rayon fabric used, especially at this price point.  the sleeveless sheer blue outer dress is a flowy swing silhouette that retains many wrinkles.  i have thick shoulders and upper arms, so the armholes cut into my armpits.  the silky rayon liner is a blush rose color with adjustable spaghetti straps.  the slip has no stretch and feels a bit tight on my chest.  i ordered size medium petite and my stats a"
0,Unflattering I was surprised at the positive reviews for this product. its terrible! it cuts you in a weird place to make you look wide. the skirt is also not like the picture. its darker and heavier. the material isnt great. i had to return.
1,"What a fun piece! So i wasn't sure about ordering this skirt because i couldn't see it in person first but i'm so glad i did. the skirt and design is well made and doesn't look or feel cheap. the color isn't blaring, offensive red so it worked with my pale skin better than i anticipated. i wore it to my daughter's dance production with tall boots and a sweater and i got numerous compliments. fit is true, i am 5'2"" and i picked the petite length. the skirt has a slight a-line rather than a tight pencil fit but the"
1,Great dress for many occasions I was very happy to snag this dress at such a great price! it's very easy to slip on and has a very flattering cut and color combo.
1,"Wish it was made of cotton It reminds me of maternity clothes. soft, stretchy, shiny material. cut is flattering and drapes nicely. i only found one button to close front... looked awkward. nice long sleeves.
not for me but maybe for others. just ok."
0,"Cute, but see through This fit well, but the top was very see through. this never would have worked for me. i'm glad i was able to try it on in the store and didn't order it online. with different fabric, it would have been great."
1,"Very cute dress, perfect for summer parties and we I bought this dress for a wedding i have this summer, and it's so cute. unfortunately the fit isn't perfect. the medium fits my waist perfectly, but was way too long and too big in the bust and shoulders. if i wanted to spend the money, i could get it tailored, but i just felt like it might not be worth it. side note - this dress was delivered to me with a nordstrom tag on it and i found it much cheaper there after looking!"
1,"Please make more like this one! This dress in a lovely platinum is feminine and fits perfectly, easy to wear and comfy, too! highly recommend!"
