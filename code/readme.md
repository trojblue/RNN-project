## Project structure



- `augment.py`: data augmentations
- `helpers.py`: training, evaluation and data processing
- `RNN.py`: main driver code for RNN
- `rnnmodel.py`: implementation of RNN Pytorch class
- `statistics.rmd`: generating sample statistics





## Setup

use the `setup()` functions in  `RNN.py` and `augment.py` to install necessary packages for the project.

The project requires [glove.6B.50d.txt](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/watts2/glove6b50dtxt) file which is too large to be uploaded onto Github.
